Brief Hospital Course:
**Patient left against medical advice. Important hospital events 
as below**

___ with history of well-controlled HIV (CD4 646, VL <75 from 
___ on Truvada/lopinavir/ritonavir, CKD (baseline Cr 1.5), 
who p/w 9 days of fatigue, malaise, myalgias, nausea, headache, 
vomiting, and poor PO intake. In order to treat these symptoms, 
he had also been taking aspirin 325mg po q4h around the clock. 
He had continued to take his HIV medication. He was found to 
have new acute renal failure, with initial labs notable for BUN 
49/Cr 9, Na 129, K 2.7, Bicarb 8, and pH of 7.13. A renal 
ultrasound did not show hydronephrosis. His urine sediment 
showed muddy brown casts, consistent with acute tubular 
necrosis. He was also found to have both a gap and nongap 
metabolic acidosis. Ultimately, we thought that he had poor PO 
intake causing pre-renal ___, and took aspirin causing 
vasocontriction and worsening renal failure, as well as 
tenofovir which may have also contributed, ultimately resulting 
in acute tubular necrosis. In this setting, tenofovir 
accummulated, likely causing proximal renal tubular acidosis, 
with resultant bicarbonate wasting and hypophosphatemia. Of 
note, he also had severe hypokalemia, thought to be due to GI 
losses.

He was treated supportively with fluids, bicarbonate infusion, 
phosphate, high doses of potassium, and supportive care. He was 
followed by the nephrology team during his hospital stay. His Cr 
did not improve but patient had good urine output. Patient left 
against medical advice despite no significant improvement in 
renal function and with Cr of 7.4. He understood all the risks 
associated with leaving against medical advice and was found to 
have capacity to leave.

His HIV regimen was changed to eliminate tenofovir. He was 
continued on lopinavir/ritonavir, emtricitabine, and 
dolutegravir was added. He should undergo HLA B5701 testing as 
an outpatient to determine whether he is a candidate for 
abacavir, which could help simplify his regimen.

ACUTE ISSUES
#ERROR!

 # ___ on CKD/Acute Tubular Necrosis: Baseline Cr 1.5. Now 
presenting with BUN/CR 49/9. FENa 6.74%, with urine sediment 
showing muddy brown casts. This most likely developed due to a 
combination of poor PO intake (as sodium improved w/ IVF, 
suggesting some degree of pre-renal etiology), use of aspirin, 
and build-up of tenofovir due to worsened renal function. He 
presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis due to renal 
failure, as well as nongapped metabolic acidosis due to proximal 
RTA (see below). He continued to make urine. He was treated 
supportively but patient left against medical advice as above 
before renal function recovery.

#Proximal renal tubular acidosis: Pt has low bicarbonate, phos, 
glucosuria with a normal serum glucose concentration, in setting 
of tenofovir use. He most likely has a proximal RTA due to 
tenofovir toxicity in setting of worsened renal function. He was 
treated with bicarbonate and phosphate, and labs were trended 
frequently. 

#Hypokalemia: Likely due to nausea, vomiting and significant GI 
losses. He has a large K deficit, as he was aggressively 
repleted (Over 400 mEQ of potassium) prior to returning to a 
normal range potassium. 

#Anemia: Hb 9.5, down from 12.3 on admission. No evidence of 
bleeding. This may be due to dilution as well as frequent 
phlebotomy. Iron studies and hemolysis labs sent and pending on 
discharge.

#Hyponatremia. Pt presented with hyponatremia, which resolved 
with fluids, suggesting degree of volume depletion on admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES

#HIV. Well-controlled, last CD4 646, VL <75 (___). 
Tenofovir was stopped given renal failure. He was continued on 
emtricitabine, renally dosed. He was continued on 
lopinavir-ritonavir. He was started on dolutegravir. Consider 
simplification of regimen as an outpatient. He will need HLA 
B5701 testing to determine if he is a candidate for 
abacavir-containing regimens.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ 
because of kidney failure. Our kidney specialists saw you, and 
we gave you medicines to keep your labs in a safe range. 
Ultimately, you decided to leave against medical advice before 
your kidney recovered. Given the high risk of further damage 
associated with leaving the hospital without improvement of your 
kidney function, please make sure to get your labs checked 
tomorrow as instructed and follow up with your primary care 
physician and kidney specialist. There is already an order in 
for labs through the ___ so you can show up at 
any ___ lab to get your labs done.

We changed your HIV medicines since we think one of the 
medications, tenofovir is contraindicated while having renal 
injury. You will now be taking emtricitabine, 
lopinavir-ritonavir, and dolutegravir. You should talk to your 
primary care doctor about further adjusting your regimen, as 
there may be simpler options.

We wish you all the best!
-Your ___ Team
