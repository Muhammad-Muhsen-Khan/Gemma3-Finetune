K-4.6 Cl-100 HCO3-24 AnGap-___ with history of depression, paroxysmal afib, temporal lobe 
epilepsy, who was brought in for depression and found to be 
hyponatremic.

#Hyponatremia: History of poor PO intake and malnutrition from 
recent social stressor. Na improved from 128 to 131 with IVF. 
Likely has component of SIADH from tegretol. Also may have poor 
solute intake as well. CXR was negative for acute lung 
abnormality to explain SIADH.

#Depression/Adjustment Disorder: Patient's son recently moved in 
and he is in poor health. This has taken a toll on the patient 
and she has not showered or gotten out of bed much for the last 
few weeks. While admitted she expressed more energy and the 
medical team believes that the acute adjustment disorder from 
her son moving in has triggered malnutrition, hypovolemia, and 
depression. She will be discharged to a rehab facility for 
physical therapy and psychiatric treatment. The daughter is 
actively involved in her care and is looking into assisted 
living for the patient after rehab. She was seen by psychiatry 
who recommended continuing home mirtazapine and discontinuing 
home sertraline at this time.

with ___ assist. Continue apixiban. Decreased metoprolol to 12.5 
for HR in ___

#Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: stable. continued tegretol.

# osteoporosis: continued home calcitonin 

Transitional Issues:
-Hyponatremia thought to be due to combination of hypovolemia 
from poor PO intake, SIADH from tegretol, and poor solute 
intake. Treatment of depression and good nutrition with a 
liberal salt diet will help and consulting with her prior 
neurologist is a possibility regarding tegretol usage. Current 
Na 131 and not clinically dangerous at this time.

discontinued by psychiatry on this admission.
