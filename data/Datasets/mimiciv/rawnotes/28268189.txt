History of Present Illness:
 
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, endometrial cancer, and metastatic triple
negative breast cancer currently on Eribulin directly admitted
today from clinic for pain control and assessment of disease
progression. 

Ms. ___ presented to her clinic appointment today after
missing a number of appointments. She has apparently missed
appointments due to the death of her ___ y/o granddaughter, which
has been extremely traumatic for the family. On presentation to
clinic she was in significant pain, which is no longer well
controlled on her home oxycodone. She also appeared to have lost
a significant amount of weight. She was therefore sent for 
direct
admission by her Oncologist Dr. ___ pain control and CT
torso to assess for disease progression.

She states that since her last chemo dose she has been feeling
progressively more unwell. She has had increasing pain in her
back and sides over her lower ribs. She describes it as a muscle
pain, which hurts mostly when she moves or walks. The pain has
become so debilitating that she cannot stand or walk for more
than a few minutes. The pain is mostly aching, but sometimes
becomes "stabbing like a knife." She has no pain in her spine or
legs. She has been taking 2.5mg oxycodone every 4 hours at home,
which helps but is not sufficient.

Bedsides her pain, she has also become increasingly fatigued and
has had a decreased appetite. She reports a >40 lb weight loss
over the past year, and feels she has likely lost more over the
past few weeks. Despite the weight loss she also reports her
abdomen has become more distended. She also endorses a cough
productive of clear-white sputum. Her cough at times causes her
to wheeze. She denies N/V/D, she does endorse constipation for
which she takes Colace and senna. Her last BM was yesterday.

ABDOMEN: 
  
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation 
throughout. 
Interval increase in size and number of hypodense lesions in the 
liver 
consistent with metastatic disease.  Of note, the largest in 
segment IV of the 
liver measures 5.5 x 5.6 cm, previously measuring 5.7 x 2.8 cm.  
There is no 
evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The 
gallbladder

lesions within 
the limitations of an unenhanced scan. There is no pancreatic 
ductal 
dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic stranding. 
  
SPLEEN: The spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 13.9 cm with 
normal 
attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. 
  
ADRENALS: The right adrenal gland is normal in size and shape.  
6 mm left 
adrenal nodule is unchanged from prior.

no evidence 
of focal renal lesions within the limitations of an unenhanced 
scan. There is 
no hydronephrosis. There is a 3 mm nonobstructing stone in the 
mid pole of the 
left kidney, similar to prior.  A 4 mm nonobstructing stone in 
the right lower 
pole is also similar to prior (3; 73).  there is no perinephric 
abnormality. 
  
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops

normal caliber and wall thickness throughout.  Diverticulosis of 
the sigmoid 
colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening and fat 
stranding. The 
appendix is normal. 
  
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.

x 1.5 cm (3; 
51).  Another enlarged gastrohepatic lymph node measuring 1.2 x 
1.5 cm is 
similar to prior (3; 50).  Prominent porta hepatic lymph node 
measuring 1.0 x 
2.7 cm is also similar to prior.  No mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

short axis, 
previously measuring 0.5 cm (3; 99).  No inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Extensive 
atherosclerotic 
disease is noted. 
  
BONES: There is increased callus formation around the chronic 
right inferior 
ramus fracture, likely pathologic.  Mixed sclerotic and lytic 
appearance of 
the T9 and T10 vertebral bodies are again demonstrated similar 
to prior.  
Chronic compression fracture of T8 is again demonstrated. 
  
SOFT TISSUES: An umbilical hernia containing fat is noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Interval increase in size and number of multiple hypodense 
lesions within 
the liver consistent with progression of metastatic disease.

CT Chest ___

FINDINGS:  
  
HEART AND VASCULATURE: Mild cardiomegaly.  Trace pericardial 
effusion.  Mild 
calcified coronary atherosclerosis.  The thoracic aorta is 
normal in caliber 
and mildly calcified.  The main pulmonary artery is normal in 
caliber. 
  
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy has 
increased since 
the prior examination.  A representative right lower 
paratracheal lymph node 
measures 1.9 cm, previously 0.9 cm.  An aortopulmonary window 
lymph node 
measures 1.4 cm, previously 0.9 cm.  A subcarinal lymph node 
measures 1.7 cm, 
previously 1.2 cm. 
  
PLEURAL SPACES: New small right pleural effusion.  No left 
pleural effusion.  
No pneumothorax. 
  
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: The airways are patent to the subsegmental level. 
 Variable 
changes in widespread pulmonary nodules, some decreased in size, 
some 
unchanged, and most increased in size.  A dominant mass in the 
right upper 
lobe has decreased in size, for example, measuring 4.5 x 4.1 cm, 
previously 
5.0 by 3.9 cm.  Abutting nodules in the right lower lobe have 
increased in 
size, for example, now appearing confluent and measuring 3.2 x 
2.0 cm, 
previously separate nodules measuring 1.3 x 1.0 cm and 1.4 x 1.3 
cm (series 4, 
image 144).  A representative left lower lobe pulmonary nodule 
measures 1.6 
cm, previously 1.0 cm (series 4, image 195).  A representative 
right upper 
lobe pulmonary nodule measures 2.0 cm, previously 1.5 cm (series

BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality. 
  
ABDOMEN: Please refer to separate report for same-day CT 
abdomen/pelvis for 
description of the abdominal findings. 
  
BONES: A presumed pathologic compression fracture of T8 with 
underlying 
sclerotic lesions is not significantly changed, with bulging of 
the posterior 
aspect of the vertebral body into the spinal canal causing at 
least mild 
spinal canal narrowing.  Increasingly conspicuous sclerosis in 
the T10 
vertebral body concerning for metastases.  Sclerosis in the T9 
vertebral body 
is not significantly changed but increased lucency in the 
lateral aspect of 
the vertebral body is concerning for an active malignant lesion. 

  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Increased size of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and 
predominantly increased 
size of widespread pulmonary nodules concerning for progression. 

2. Probably worsened osseous metastases at T9 and T10. 
3. A pathologic compression fracture at T8 is not significantly 
changed.

Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You were admitted to the hospital for control of your worsening

known metastatic breast cancer. You were seen by the Palliative 
Care team, who helped to adjust your pain medications to better 
control your pain. They would like to follow up with you after 
your discharge, and an appointment has been scheduled for you 
next week. You were evaluated by the Physical Therapy team, who
