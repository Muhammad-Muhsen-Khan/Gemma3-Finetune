Brief Hospital Course:
On ___ the patient was seen and evaluated by the vascular 
surgery service, and admitted to the floor under the care of the 
vascular surgery team.  There was strong concern for an occluded 
graft in the right lower extremity.

On ___ a chest x-ray was obtained, showing mild to moderate 
pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, thus cardiology was consulted.  
Their team recommended diuresis, and Lasix IV was initiated.  
The patient was also started on a heparin drip for 
anticoagulation.

From ___ to ___, she was kept on a heparin drip. There 
were no acute events at this time.  

On ___, the patient was consented for thrombectomy.  She 
went to the operating room on ___, where she underwent right 
fem-pop thrombectomy/embolectomy, with Viabahn placement. 
Estimated blood loss during the case was 300cc.  
Post-operatively she was hypotensive in the PACU and put on a 
neo drip.  A hematocrit in the PACU was found to be 24.9.  She 
was put on a dilaudid PCA by chronic pain.  By 2100 hours she 
did not require the neo drip, and continued to have dopplerable 
signals.  

On ___ the patient was found to have a hematocrit of 21.2 
and given 1 unit of pRBC.  She had bilateral crackles and an O2 
requirement of 2L nasal cannula.  To treat her acute on chronic 
systolic CHF, cardiology recommended Lasix 40mg IV x 2.  She 
continued to have dopplerable signals at this time. Pain control 
was an issue and the chronic pain service made various changes 
to her pain regimen.

On ___ her diuresis continued in order to treat her acute on 
chronic systolic CHF.  She was 2.4L net negative on ___ and 
at this time her foley and arterial line were removed. 

On ___ her cultures grew MSSA, and ID recommended nafcillin. 
 Cardiology recommended continuing her torsemide diuresis, with 
this dose being 40mg.

From ___ to ___, the patient's creatinine rose from 1.6 to 
2.3.  Her diuretics were held, renally metabolized medications 
were decreased, and due to increased pain secondary to a 
decreased dose of gabapentin, chronic pain service recommended 
starting tizanidine.  This medication was of great utility in 
relieving the patients pain.

On ___ she went to the operating room with podiatry, who 
debrided both the heel ulcer and the ulcer on the plantar aspect 
of her right foot.  Integra grafts were placed over both sites. 
Her creatinine began to downtrend, so cardiology recommended 
torsemide 30mg.  Her Coumadin was restarted on ___, and the 
heparin drip was continued until her INR was therapeutic.

On ___ Infectious Disease was consulted for a potential graft 
infection. In the afternoon the patient reported some left 
shoulder pain with movement.  An EKG showed no abnormal 
electrical activity and there was no concern for a cardiac 
event.  

On ___, per ID recs her oral Levoquin was discontinued and IV 
Ancef initiated.   Her ___ improved (1.7->1.6) and her Coumadin 
was continued.  Her INR was 2.2.

On ___ her INR was 3.1, thus her heparin drip was 
discontinued.  

On ___, erythema and induration on her right thigh incision 
was noted on morning rounds.  There was a small amount of 
discharge that had a purulent appearance, and the incision was 
opened at the bedside with cultures sent.  The wound was packed, 
and the patient agreed to having a PICC line placed.  Of note, 
her weight on this day was 6.7 kg greater than when she was 
admitted, and diuresis continued.  

On ___ the PICC line that she agreed to the previous day was 
placed.  

On ___ there was no growth to date on the cultures taken 
___. Infectious Disease recommended discharge on cefazolin 2g 
q8hr and rifampin 300mg q8hr.  She will follow up in clinic with 
vascular surgery on ___ with a non-contrast CT of abdomen 
and pelvis and lower extremities.
