History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with Childs C alcohol cirrhosis 
(complicated by ascites, portal gastropathy and hepatic 
encephalopathy) and spinal stenosis (on morphine and oxycodone 
at rehab), with recent admission for fall with scapular 
fracture, who is presenting today with new onset hemodynamically 
unstable Afib with RVR, acute encephalopathy, and leukocytosis 
following large volume paracentesis.  
 The patient presented today from his outpatient rehabilitation 
facility for a routine paracentesis. At his nursing facility, he 
was given a dose of morphine prior to the procedure. He had 5.7L 
of yellow fluid removed from abdomen, which was discarded and 
was given back 37.5g albumin after the paracentesis. After the 
procedure, the patient became mildly dyspneic and somnolent. He 
was found to be tachycardic in afib with RVR at a rate of 140, 
and his blood pressure dropped into the 70's systolic, so he was 
sent to the ED.  
 In the ED initial vitals: ___ BP 98/63 RR14 O2 sat 97%  
 - Exam notable for: altered, A&Ox1, no abdominal ttp, brusing 
to rlq  
 - ECG notable for 12:30: Atrial fibrillation with rates in 
130's. After cardioversion 3 ___: NSR in 100's.  
 - Imaging notable for: CXR No acute abnormality. Reticular 
opacities bilaterally consistent with chronic interstitial lung 
disease.  
 - Labs notable for: UA not infected, NO DIAGNOSTIC PARACENTESIS 
WAS DONE, lactate 3.0, troponin <0.01, sodium 132, K 5.3, bicarb 
20, AG 14, BUN 75 with creatinine 1.7 (baseline 1.2-1.3), Tbili 
2.9, AST 75, ALT 39, AP 240, Albumin 3.0, WBC 11.2, H/H 
9.8/30.5, plt 85, INR 1.4.  
 - Patient was given: 2L NS, 2g ceftriaxone, Fentanyl 100 mcg 
for cardioversion, albumin 5% 500 cc.  
 - Underwent DCCV (Procedural sedation performed with 100mcg 
fentanyl. 2 shocks were delivered, second attempt successful, in 
NSR at rate of 100-105)  
 - Vitals prior to transfer: 96.9 89 110/66 12 98% 2L NC  
 On the floor, the patient reports that he is feeling much

portal gastropathy and hepatic encephalopathy), spinal stenosis 
on chronic pain meds, and recent admission for fall c/b scapular 
fracture and persistent ascites, who presented from outpatient 
___ with hemodynamically unstable Afib with RVR s/p DCCV x 2, 
acute encephalopathy, and sepsis thought to be ___ SBP with his 
hospital course complicated by ___ and dysphagia. 

# Afib w/ RVR: while at his outpatient ___ appointment, patient 
was noted to be hypotensive with ECG concerning for atrial 
fibrillation with RVR. He underwent ___ x2 without return to 
sinus rhythm. He was evaluated by Cardiology, with etiology of 
afib thought to be ___ hypovolemia following LVP vs SBP vs 
cardiac etiology. Cardiac work-up, including ECG, trops, and TTE 
were negative for ischemic changes. He was initially rate 
controlled with metoprolol, transitioned to diltiazem in the 
setting ___ with stabilization of HRs <110. CHADVASC2 of ___ 
for prior diagnosis of HTN and DMII, however, given his high 
risk for anticoagulation he was started on po aspirin. He will 
need outpatient follow up with Cardiology. 

# Hepatic Encephalopathy: Patient lethargic with asterixis on 
admission, with etiology thought to be infection vs medications. 
He received lactulose/rifaximin and his mental status improved 
to baseline prior to discharge.

# Presumed SBP, ascites: patient with large volume ascites, 
receiving outpatient ___ paracenteses. On admission, in 
the setting of hypotension and afib, there was concern for SBP 
as trigger. Unfortunately, no fluid studies were sent on initial 
paracentesis. He received empiric treatment with IV CTX/albumin 
with improvement in his hypotension. He was discharged on 
ciprofloxacin 500mg daily for SBP secondary ppx. Diuretics were 
unable to be restarted ___ ___, hyponatremia. He received x2 
LVPs in hospital, with 5L removed on ___ negative for SBP. He 
will need ongoing ascites management with LVPs as an outpatient. 


# Acute kidney injury: Patient presenting with BUN 75/Cr 1.7, 
from baseline about ___. Following treatment of SBP with 
abx/albumin, his Cr downtrended. 
-Cr on discharge: 1.1 

# Decompensated EtOH cirrhosis: Childs C, MELD 23 on admission. 
His cirrhosis has been complicated by recurrent ascites, hepatic 
encephalopathy, and portal gastropathy. Acute decompensation was 
thought to be ___ potentially related to hypovolemia vs. 
infection. His MELD labs were trended daily and returned to 
baseline. He was continued on lactulose/rifaximin. He was 
initiated on ciprofloxacin for SBP ppx. Diuretics were not 
restarted on discharge. 

# Question of dysphagia: in the hospital, patient endorsed 
dysphagia to solids and liquids. He was evaluated at bedside by 
SLP, concerning for aspiration with all liquids. EGD was notable 
for moderate portal hypertensive gastropathy, few nodules in 
antrum, and 1 cord of grade I varices were seen in the lower 
third of the esophagus without obstruction/infection/stricture. 
Videoswallow was negative for aspiration. He was discharged on 
diet of ground solid/thin liquids in the setting of losing his 
dentures. 

# Spinal stenosis/scapular fracture: patient is on chronic 
narcotics for pain associated with spinal stenosis, and had been 
receiving increased doses of narcotics following recent 
admission for fall found to have a scapular fracture. In the 
setting of encephalopathy all pain medications were initially 
held. As his mental status improved, he was transitioned to a 
regimen of OxyCODONE SR (OxyconTIN) 10mgPO Q12H with TraMADol 50 
mg PO Q6H:PRN Pain - Moderate alternating with OxyCODONE 
(Immediate Release) 5 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN Pain - Severe for 
additional control. He will ongoing ___.

# Type II Diabetes: he was continued on home Glargine 26 u QHS, 
Humalog SS

contributing to difficulty with swallowing. Please assist with 
getting new dentures

[] NO diuretics on discharge
[] Discharge weight: 96.4kg
[] Discharge diet: ground solids, thin liquids
[] Last large volume paracentesis on ___ with 5L removed, will 
likely need next LVP with ___ early-mid 
[] TI from previous hospitalization:
-Further workup for hematuria- Consider urology consultation 
-ON MRI SHOULDER, the scapula appeared concerning for possible 
underlying bony lesion, but orthopedics team was not concerned. 
Consider following this up with a CT scan of the 
shoulder.-Contact: Sister, ___
