Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Tachycardia, Lightheadedness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with CAD (s/p STEMI ___ with 2 bare metal stents to mid
LAD ___, cardiac cath ___ with PTCA to RCA, most recent cath
___ with TO RCA and proximal to that 99%, elevated LVEDP, no
PCI done ___ high risk), HTN, afib, HFrEF LVEF 55%, AF on
xeralto, prior TIA, CAS with CEA, T2DM, HLD, PUD, COPD who
presents with worsening dyspnea.
The patient was recently discharged from ___, had been 
admitted for a heart failure exacerbation. During that stay he 
was diuresed with 120mg IV Lasix bolus, metolazone, and 
___ drip until euvolemic. He had bilateral ___ on ___ 
for effusions. His TTE was notable for an EF of 40% and features 
c/w restrictive CM. This along with a CT non-con showing e/o 
cirrhosis raised questions of possible
amyloid CM, but given his overall poor prognosis, further workup 
was deferred. His course was complicated by E. coli sepsis, 
contained perforation of a peptic ulcer, and he was treated 
conservatively with antibiotics. Goals of care discussions were 
had an based on this patient expressed wishes to be DNR/DNI. He 
was discharged to rehab on a course of IV ceftriaxone and PO 
metronidazole (final course TBD by ID team) and plans to repeat 
CT non-con with barium A/P and follow up
with ID as an outpatient.
At ___, he was noted to have a weight gain of 7 lbs over the 
past few days, in the setting of having his torsemide decreased 
from 100 mg to 90 mg daily. He reported dizziness and 
palpitations, and was found to be tachycardic to the 150s. No 
abdominal pain, no n/v/d. Denies black or bloody stool. No 
fevers.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.8 F, HR 100-120s, BP 90/40s,

IMAGING
#ERROR!
CHEST X RAY:  ___
Moderate to large right and small to moderate left bilateral 
pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, increased since 
the prior study. Underlying basilar consolidation difficult to 
exclude. Moderate to severe, right greater than left, pulmonary 
edema.  

___ ABD & PELVIS W/O CON
IMPRESSION:
1. Near complete resolution of inflammation surrounding a 
duodenal
diverticulum.  No extraluminal contrast or free air.
2. Mild interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and 
pericardial
effusion.
3. Increased heterogeneous right basilar lung opacity, could 
represent
pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.

___
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. There is 
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___. The right ventricular 
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall 
hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is 
depressed (1.1 cm) consistent with right ventricular systolic 
dysfunction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation 
is seen. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the 
setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, 
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There 
is a small pericardial effusion. Bilateral pleural effusions are 
present. 

IMPRESSION: Prominent LV wall thickening with severe global left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate right ventricular 
systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate 
pulmonary hypertension. Small pericardial effusion. An 
infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac amyloidosis, should 
be considered.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
biventricular systolic function has further deteriorated. There 
is more mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with CHFrEF 40% (presumed amlyoid 
cardiomyopathy), CAD, PUD, HTN, CKD (baseline Cr 1.5), 
questionable cirrhosis (seen on CT imaging), and recent duodenal 
ulcer perforation on ceftriaxone/flagyl presenting from rehab 
with recurrent systolic CHF exacerbation complicated by large 
right sided and moderate left sided pleural effusion improved 
with diuresis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Systolic CHF (new LVEF = ___, presumed amyloid 
cardiomyopathy): 
Presented with history of systolic dysfunction with a 
restrictive component (c/o amyloid) and was volume overloaded on 
exam (BNP was 10K, had reported 7Kg weight gain). Patient was 
managed on a lasix drip at 20 cc/hr with intermittent doses of 
metolazone. Patient diuresed adequately and returned to below 
his dry weight prior to discharge. Has been intolerant of it in 
the past with hypotension. Not on spironolactone due to 
hypotension as well. Torsemide 100 mg daily was continued on 
discharge. Of note, surface echo showed worsening biventricular 
systolic function and EF of Weight on discharge of: 63.5 Kg or 
139.7 lbs. If patient's weight increases by more than 2 lbs. 
over three days torsemide dose should be increased to 100 mg 
BID. Patient continued on magnesium oxide 400 mg daily and 
potassium chloride 20 mEQ daily. Can be discontinued pending 
ongoing discussion of medical management and de-escalation. 

# Large right sided and moderate left sided pleural effusion 
improved with diuresis. 
Effusions remained stable and patient was diuresed with IV Lasix 
and transitioned to torsemide 100 mg daily prior to discharge. 

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:
Has had RVR several times this admission that responds to PO 
metop. Have avoided anything IV as he becomes hypotensive given 
his restrictive physiology. Changed amiodarone 200 mg daily this 
admission from QOD. On apixiban BID for anticoagulation. Metop 
12.5 mg XL daily started given rapid rates to the 140's at times 
with associated dizziness. Can be de-escalated and stopped as 
seen fit by hospice team.

# History of duodenal perforation: Occurred during prior 
admission, patient was planned on ceftriaxone and flagyl. ID 
while patient in house recommended repeat CT abdomen/pelvis that 
showed almost entirely healed perforation. They recommend 
discontinuation of IV ceftriaxone/flagyl given improvement of 
findings on imaging in addition to patients overall goals of 
care. Aspirin 81 mg continued to be held. Patient does not need 
to follow up with ID on discharge as outpatient. 

# Anemia: Monitored H/H that remained stable without need for 
transfusion. Iron pills were discontinued to minimize 
medications as patient was transitioning to hospice care. 

# Goals of Care- On last admission, patient was made DNR/DNI. 
Palliative care was consulted on this admission and goals of 
care with son/HCP involved were transitioned to hospice at 
___. MOLST form was completed. Morphine 5 mg PRN every 4 
hours started as needed for chest pain or dyspnea. All other 
unnecessary medications were discontinued. Further medications 
can be discontinued pending ongoing discussion with hospice team 
and Dr. ___ patient primary cardiologist. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# CKD: 
Cr at 1.5 consistent with prior baseline. Creatinine on 
discharge of 1.8. Meds were renally dosed. 

# CAD: Recent cath done in ___, too high risk for intervention. 
Given high risk and goals of care, cath deferred. Aspirin was 
discontinued at that time in setting of duodenal perforation. 
Atorvastatin was discontinued given patient's overall goals of 
care. 

#DM: 
Patient continued on ISS while in house. Patient required small 
amounts of insulin while in the hospital so insulin sliding 
scale was discontinued on discharge given hospice and palliative 
goals. 

# E/o Cirrhosis on CT: 
Hepatitis serologies negative. Patient has history of heavy 
alcohol use in the past. No signs of decompensation during this 
hospitalization. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!
MEDICATION
- NEW: morphine 5 mg every 4 hours PRN started for pain and 
dyspnea
- CHANGED: Torsemide dose on discharge of 100 mg daily
- STOPPED: ceftriaxone, flagyl, ferrous sulfate, multivitamin, 
atorvastatin, and insulin sliding scale (patient required

-weight on discharge: 63.5 Kg or 139.7 lbs.
-if weight increases by more than 2 lbs. in 3 days please 
increase torsemide dose to 100 mg BID. Please call Dr. ___ 
___ for titration of Torsemide ___. 
-patient transitioned to hospice care at ___. This was 
documented with MOLST form prior to discharge. Patient's 
cardiologist Dr. ___ will assist with titration of torsemide 
dose with hospice team.
-consider discontinuation of apixiban in discussion with Dr. 
___ ___. 
-consider discontinuation of metoprolol pending follow up of 
heart rates and blood pressures
-consider discontinuation of potassium and magnesium as well 
pending ongoing de-escalation of medications and if torsemide 
stopped for any reason
