with
3 days of cough. Patient reports that 3 days prior to admission,
she began to experience a non-productive cough that lead to her
feeling short of breath. She also reports feeling general body
pain and "like she has the flu". 2 days prior to admission, she
began to experience watery diarrhea. 1 day prior to admission,
patient vomited after eating lunch. Patient's son, who lives 
with
her, reportedly had a cold the last couple of weeks. She was 
then
taken to her PCP, who sent her to an OSH with concern for
pneumonia. At the OSH, CTA was found to be negative for PNA and
PE but showed changes c/w COPD. However, there was concern for
her respiratory status and that she might need ICU level of 
care,
so patient was transferred to ___ ED.   

Of note, patient has a ~30 pack year smoking history, quit ___

hospitalized twice in the past year ___ impaction, last in ___. She is on a bowel regimen of standing Senna, Miralaax, and
Lactulose PRN.  

In the ED, initial VS were T99.1, ___, BP 129/73, RR 18, Sat 
96%
2LNC. Exam notable for tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased air
movement, and non-tender, non-distended abdomen.    
Labs showed normal WBC, BUN/Cr > ___, lactate 2.0, trop 0.6.    


Received duonebs, azithromycin 500mg, prednisone 40mg, and O2.   

Decision was made to admit to medicine for further management of
presumed COPD exacerbation. Patient was also noted to have 
atrial
fibrillation on telemetry although without any prior cardiac
history.

IMAGING:
#ERROR!
___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP)    
1. Compared to ___, persistent hyperinflation of the 
lungs suggestive of COPD, with unchanged appearance of the 
cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
2. The previously seen pulmonary edema has effectively resolved. 

3. No large volume pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
4. Persistent opacification at the left lung base, likely 
representing 
atelectasis. 

___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function.
2) Grade II LV diastolic dysfunction with elevated LVEDP by 
E/e'. 
      
___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
There are no prior chest radiographs available. 
This study is compared to a subsequent chest radiograph 
available the time of this this review, showing that mild 
interstitial edema is present on the current examination and 
improved over the next 9 hours.  Mild left lower lobe 
atelectasis does not change.  No appreciable pleural effusion.  
Heart size normal.  Large lung volumes suggest emphysema. 

 
___ CTA (OSH)
No evidence of PNA or PE 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for HTN, HLD, and ~30 pack year smoking 
history who presents with 3 days of cough, found to have diffuse 
wheezing and decreased air movement concerning for COPD 
exacerbation, clinical picture consistent with hypoxic 
respiratory failure ___ flash pulmonary edema and COPD 
exacerbation v PNA. Patient also presented with hypertensive 
crisis and persistent tachycardia. Patient was started on 
levalbuterol (given tachycardia) and ipratropium nebs, 
prednisone, and azithrmoycin. She was started on verapamil for 
HTN crisis (SBPs 190s-220s). On HD 2, she acutely worsened and 
CXR showed area of consolidation and pulmonary edema. She was 
given IV Lasix and started on ceftriaxone. On HD 3, patient 
clinically improved. On HD 4, patient was noted to be in afib 
with RVR. Verapamil was d/c'd and she was started on diltiazem 
PO 30mg TID, which was uptitrated for rate control. She was also 
started on apixaban. She was subsequently converted to diltiazem 
ER PO 120mg. Her home lisinopril 10mg PO was continued as well 
for HTN control. After completion of steroid burst and 
antibiotics, she was eventually transitioned to Spiriva and 
albuterol PRN for COPD management. She was evaluated by ___ who 
recommended discharge home with services including home ___. 

#Hypoxic respiratory failure: patient presented with 
non-productive cough, diffuse wheezing and decreased air 
movement on exam. OSH CTA neg for PE and pneumonia, although 
with some areas of consolidation that could be consistent with 
atypical pneumonia. Patient without fevers or leukocytosis. She 
required increasing amounts of O2 to support her oxygenation and 
blood gases revealed PO2 <60. Patient's respiratory failure was 
thought to be due to COPD exacerbation v community-acquired 
pneumonia. She was placed on continuous O2 monitoring. She was 
started on levalbuterol (due to tachycardia), tiotropium 
nebulizers. She was given a prednisone burst (50mg x5 days) and 
started on azithromycin. When patient's respiratory status 
declined on HD 2, she was started on ceftriaxone for CAP and 
given a longer course of azithromycin. She was also found to 
have 2 episodes of flash pulmonary edema ___ hypertensive crisis 
(see below) and given lasix 20mg IV x3. Patient's respiratory 
status improved and she was eventually weaned off oxygen prior 
to discharge. She was discharged on spiriva and albuterol PRN. 

#Hypertensive Crisis: patient with hx HTN, unknown baseline, on 
lisinopril 10mg daily. During the admission she triggered 
multiple times for SBPs 190s-220s that resulted in flash 
pulmonary edema and contributed to the patient's respiratory 
failure. Initially she was responsive to captopril; however when 
she needed rate control for her atrial fibrillation she was 
switched to verapamil. When further rate control was needed, she 
was changed to diltiazem PO and uptitrated to 45mg PO q6h. She 
was eventually transitioned to Dilt ER 120mg PO daily. Her SBPs 
were in the 140s-150s. Her home lisinopril 10mg PO daily was 
added with resultant pressures in the 110s-120s range.  

#Afib with RVR: Patient without known cardiac history. Upon 
admission, trop 0.06, repeat trops 0.04-0.06. She was noted to 
have new fib on tele in the ED; however, EKGs with sinus 
tachycardia. Repeat EKG with HR ___ with j-points and without 
evidence of acute ischemic changes. TSH 5.8. A TTE showed grade 
II diastolic dysfunction, normal systolic function and EF. Trop 
leak thought likely ___ tachycardia and hypertensive crisis. 
Patient then was noted to be in a fib with RVR on telemetry. She 
was initially started on verapamil then transitioned to 
diltiazem. She triggered multiple times during the admission for 
afib with RVR to the 160s-170s during which episodes she was 
given IV metoprolol and IV dilt. The diltiazem was uptitrated to 
45mg PO q6h then switched to dilt ER 120mg. Patient's CHADS-Vasc 
score was calculated to be 5. After discussion with the patient 
about the risks and benefits of anticoagulation, she was started 
on apixaban 2.5mg BID. Upon discharge, patient was in NSR with a 
rate of ___. 

#Deconditioning: Patient was noted to be frail on exam. ___ was 
c/s for evaluation for deconditioning and mobility. Initially ___ 
recommend rehab; however, patient adamantly refused rehab 
admission. During admission, ___ to continued to work with 
patient to improve endurance, mobility, and ventilation. She was 
eventually discharged home with a rolling walker and home ___ 
services. 

#?Dysphagia: patient noted by nurse to have difficulty 
swallowing pills, including pills given with apple sauce. She 
was evaluated by Speech and Swallow how noted no particular 
dysphagia and recommended regular diet with thin liquids, 
medications crushed with pureed solids, and aspiration 
precautions.

#Diarrhea: At baseline, patient reports chronic constipation and 
is on senna, miralaax, and PRN lactulose. On presentation 
patient with 2 day history of diarrhea with evidence of 
hypovolemia (dry mucus membranes and tachycardia).  Likely ___ 
bowel regimen. Her bowel regimen was held and the diarrhea 
resolved. The patient then reported constipation and she was 
restarted on her home bowel regimen with the addition of 
bisacodyl PRN.

clinically appropriate. 
[] Patient presented with shortness of breath and wheezing with
