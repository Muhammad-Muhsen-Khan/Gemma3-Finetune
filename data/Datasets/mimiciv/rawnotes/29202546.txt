Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT: ___ hx afib on AC, CKD, SSS w/o PPM, 
TAA/AAA,
orthostatic hypotension, who was recently admitted for BRBPR
___, presenting today with BRBPR after initiation of
apixaban

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:

# BRBPR
# Acute blood loss anemia; acute GI hemorrhage 
Pt presenting with one episode of BRBPR after starting apixaban
day prior. Blood bright in color and mixed in with stool, not on
toilet paper. Recent hospitalization with imaging showing 
pooling
of blood in sigmoid colon and c-scope with internal hemorrhoids,
diverticulosis throughout colon- most severe in sigmoid region.
Bleeding was with stool only, had largely resolved after 
admission.  However, he had one bowel movement with blood, and 
was watched for another day, but had no further episodes.  His 
Hgb 9.4 -> 8.4 -> 8.3(discharge hgb 8.9 on ___.  Most likely 
diverticular or hemorrhoidal bleed while taking anticoagulation. 
 Because of these locations, GI consulted, and did not recommend 
a repeat colonoscopy because it would not offer any 
interventions that would be beneficial.  He received IV iron ___ 
- ___.  He will go home on folate as well as oral iron to help 
replace his stores over time. 

# A fib
CHADS2Vasc=3 (age, previous hypertension--though note he is no
longer hypertensive since Afib per his report, so score/risk may
be even lower), with relatively low risk for daily CVA. 
He continued home very low dose metoprolol succ 12.5 daily 
We discussed holding ___ and eventually restarting lower dose 
apixaban in the future  given age and CKD (2.5 BID) vs accepting 
slightly higher risk of
stroke.  I discussed this with the patient and his daughter.  
His preference
is to hold AC until he can speak with all of his outpatient 
doctors in ___, Cardiology, and PCP.  We discussed the risks and 
benefits of this strategy. He understands, had the opportunity 
to ask questions, and agrees. 

#Depression
- Fluvoxamine Maleate 100 mg PO BID

this medication, tamsulosin has also been dc since then

#HLD

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with GI bleeding after you 
restarted your anticoagulation. The likely source from the 
bleeding was diverticulosis, but hemorrhoids could have 
contributed also.  Your bleeding resolved, and you did not 
require any additional blood transfusions or interventions.  You 
received 2 doses of IV iron and will discuss the resumption of 
anticoagulation with the outpatient doctors who know ___. This 
should largely be driven by cardiology, and they can consider 
dose reduction from what you were on previously based on your 
age greater than ___ and chronic renal insufficiency. 

We wish you the best in your recovery, 
Your ___ Team
