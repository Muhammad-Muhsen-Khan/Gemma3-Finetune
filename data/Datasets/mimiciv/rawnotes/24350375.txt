STUDIES/IMAGING
#ERROR!
Renal transplant US ___
FINDINGS:  
The left iliac fossa transplant renal morphology is normal.  
Specifically, the cortex is of normal thickness and 
echogenicity, pyramids are normal, there is no urothelial 
thickening, and renal sinus fat is normal.  There is no 
hydronephrosis.  Trace pelvic free fluid is noted. 
  
The resistive index of intrarenal arteries ranges from 0.59 to 
0.64, within the normal range.  The main renal artery shows a 
normal waveform, with prompt systolic upstroke and continuous 
antegrade diastolic flow, with peak systolic velocity of 125 
centimeters/second.  Vascularity is symmetric throughout 
transplant. The transplant renal vein is patent and shows normal 
waveform. 
IMPRESSION:  
Normal renal transplant ultrasound. 

Pelvic ultrasound transvaginal ___
FINDINGS:  
  
The uterus is anteverted and measures 7.8 x 3.5 x 4.5 cm.  The 
endometrium is heterogeneous, shows both echogenic and cystic 
portions, and measures 7 mm.  
No internal blood flow is seen within the endometrium.  These 
findings may 
represent blood products due to stage of the menstrual cycle, 
although 
underlying polyp or additional lesion is difficult to exclude. 
  
The ovaries are normal.  There is no free fluid. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Heterogeneous, avascular endometrium with both echogenic and 
cystic portions, measuring up to 7 mm.  These findings may 
represent blood products due to stage of menstrual cycle, 
although underlying polyp or additional lesion is not excluded 
and may be present.  Recommend gynecologic follow-up and 
follow-up ultrasound ___ days after termination of bleeding. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend gynecologic follow-up and 
follow-up ultrasound ___ days after termination of bleeding.
