Imaging:

CXR (___) - IMPRESSION: 
The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic 
trachea.  The
tip of the feeding tube projects below the level the diaphragms 
but beyond the
field of view of this radiograph. The tip of a right PICC line 
projects
approximately 1.5 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction.
There is a left pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities likely 
reflect
atelectasis. An element of mild pulmonary edema is also present. 
 The size of
the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.

TTE (___) - The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Doppler parameters 
are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. The 
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated right ventricle 
with moderate free wall hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular 
global systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension. 

RUS U/S (___) - 1. Heterogeneously echogenic liver, compatible 
with geographic steatosis.
Other forms of liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic 
fibrosis, or
cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
2. Borderline splenomegaly.

B ___ (___) - IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity
veins.

TTE (___) - MARKEDLY LIMITED STUDY/FOCUSED IMAGES ONLY There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall ejection fraction is probably 
low normal, but difficult to assess.The right ventricular cavity 
is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is 
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve is not 
well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ , 
biventricular function (right greater than left) is more 
impaired. There is evidence of right ventricular pressure/volume 
overload. The left ventricular cavity is significantly smaller. 

CT Chest (___) - IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral consolidations and peribronchovascular 
ground-glass
opacities, as detailed above, are consistent with multifocal 
pneumonia.
2. The left lower lobe is almost completely collapsed.
3. Prominent mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes are likely 
reactive.

CXR (___) - IMPRESSION: 
Slight increase in the right lower lung opacity and unchanged 
left mid-lung
opacity, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Moderate to severe left lower lung collapse.
Interval increase in the left pleural effusion.

CXR (___) - IMPRESSION: 
In comparison with the study of ___, there again are 
multiple areas
of increased opacification bilaterally, consistent with 
multifocal pneumonia
that was better seen on the CT study of ___.  
Monitoring and support
devices are unchanged.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there is little if 
any vascular
congestion.  Pleural effusions are seen bilaterally. 
Retrocardiac
opacification suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe.

CXR (___) - IMPRESSION: 
Chest AP view is compared to a prior done on ___.  A 
triangular
opacity in the left midlung peripherally and another parenchymal 
opacity in
the right lower lobe with a somewhat triangular appearance 
peripherally is
also unchanged.  Small bilateral effusions left greater than 
right are stable.
Left-sided PICC line and right-sided PICC line catheter 
unchanged in position.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Lungs are low in 
volume.  No
pneumothorax is seen.

# Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure with 
hypercapnea: 
Patient initially presented to A-J with worsening of baseline 
cough and was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. She was started 
on prednisone 40mg PO QD ___ to complete ___nding ___. Patient had acute worsening of respiratory status, 
became hypoxic and apneic and was intubated on ___. Was 
initially receiving azithromycin, however switched to 
levofloxacin on ___ as CXR was revealing for patchy bilateral 
densities with new RLL consolidation. The patient self-extubated 
on the afternoon of ___ but, due to worsening respiratory 
distress and hypoxia/tachypnea, was ultimately reintubated later 
that evening. She was limited from extubation by agitation and 
hypoxia, but ultimately sedation was able to be optimized and 
she was extubated on ___. Patient was called out to medicine 
floor on ___. However on AM of ___ she was transferred back to 
___ for altered mental status and hypoxia. She had evidence of 
volume overload and so she had bedside HD with 2L removed x 3 
continuous days with good effect. Additionally, patient's 
agitation and issues with BiPap improved. The primary barrier to 
BiPap seemed to be discomfort on the nasal bridge so adjustments 
were made to the mask which improved patient's tolerance.  She 
was saturating well on 3L supplemental NC O2 on discharge with 
BiPAP at night. 

# Renal failure: Patient developed ___ in the setting of 
aggressive IV diuresis. Creatinine began to rise rapidly on the 
afternoon of ___ to 1.2 from 0.9. Repeat measurement on the 
morning of ___ revealed creatinine of 2.7. This continued to 
uptrend to a peak of 7.3 on ___, felt to be due to possible ATN. 
Patient was started on CRRT and then transitioned to HD. Renal 
continued to follow throughout hospital course. She ultimately 
had increased urine output with laboratory evidence of recovery 
of renal function. HD was stopped as of ___, and the patient 
remained stable. HD line was removed on ___. Discharge 
creatinine 1.3.

# A Fib with RVR: On ___, in the setting of aggressive diuresis, 
patient developed tachycardia to 150s showing A fib with RVR. 
She was treated with IV metoprolol and loaded with amiodarone. 
Rates were controlled. Later, she went back into RVR and was 
given dilt, metoprolol, reloaded with amiodarone, then started 
on po metoprolol, dilt, and amiodarone. She was ultimately 
discharged on a regimen of 50mg Toprol XL and 200 amiodarone.  
She was in NSR on discharge.

# L pleural effusion:
# Diastolic CHF:
# Stress cardiomyopathy - Patient was being actively diuresed 
with Lasix 40mg Q12H IV at AJ with 1700 UOP. Considering BPs 
were soft on transfer with SBPs in 80, additional diuresis was 
held on admission. Pro-BNP was 103. She was noted to have 
pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR and was started on Lasix 
40mg with little output. Her Lasix was up-titrated up to 160 mg 
IV BID. Diuresis was temporarily held in the setting of ___, and 
the patient was then started on CRRT. Fluid was removed via CRRT 
and patient was maintained on pressors to support her BP during 
this process. Repeat TTE on ___ showed worsening biventricular 
function with evidence of RV pressure/volume overload. She was 
ultimately transitioned to HD for fluid management throughout 
much of her hospital course. After her renal function improved, 
HD was stopped as above. She was given a few doses of Torsemide 
from ___ but this was stopped given worsening metabolic 
alkalosis.  She continued to autodiurese despite holding all 
diuretics.  On ___ she developed mild shortness of breath and 
she received IV diuresis with 40mg IV Lasix daily. Please 
evaluate on da dialy basis for the need for IV diuresis vs 
transition to oral torsemide ___ PO daily. 

# Leukocytosis/PNA: Leukocytosis of 13.6, likely secondary to 
possible retrocardiac opacity seen on CXR and patchy opacities 
in right lung field. Patient was started on levofloxacin at A-J 
on ___. On ___, patient was started on vanc/cefepime due to 
concern for HAP. On ___, she was started on zosyn given ongoing 
fevers. On ___, she was broadened levofloxacin/meropenem for 
continued fevers despite broad antibiotic coverage. Levofloxacin 
was discontinued on ___ due to adequate coverage with meropenem. 
She was also treated with gentamicin for a period of time. 
Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative. Antibiotics 
were stopped on ___.

# EtOH withdrawal: Patient initially found to be in acute EtOH 
withdrawal with DTs. She was phenobarb loaded and subsequently 
received 260mg, followed by 130 on ___. It is unclear why 
phenobarb taper was discontinued on ___. At ___, she was 
treated with additional phenobarbital. She was also treated with 
a multivitamin, thiamine, and folate.

# Transaminitis: ALT/AST 92/63 up from 60/49. Likely in the 
setting of chronic EtOH abuse. LFTs began to uptrend on ___. 
RUQUS was negative for cholecystitis. LFT's normalized prior to 
discharge.

# HITT: Had decreasing platelets in clinical setting of HITT, 
PF4 antibodies positive. Heparin was d/c'ed and she was put on 
argatroban. Ultimately transitioned to Coumadin which she will 
be continued on for at least ___ weeks and possibly longer for 
afib pending outpatient Cardiology w/u.

# Delirium, Agitation: While intubated, patient was extremely 
agitated and delirious. Given phenobarbital load, then 
transitioned to olanzapine. She was ultimately placed on 
mirtazepine to help with sleep.  This was stopped on discharge 
as pt was no longer agitated

# Otitis Externa: Patient reported ear pain on ___. Erythema 
noted in external canal. Started on otic Cipro BID for 7 days 
with ___. 

Transitional:
=========
[ ] Pt needs to continue coumadin until at least ___, possibly 
indefinitely pending w/u for any recurrent Afib. Should stay on 
Coumadin pending evaluation by cardiology.
