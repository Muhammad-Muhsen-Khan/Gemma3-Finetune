Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with recent traumatic fractures of ankle and hip 
related to physical abuse by daughter at home who presented to 
the hospital with an unsafe living situation, found to have 
potentially a UTI but ultimately discharged herself against 
medical advice
  
# UTI.
Fever to 101 in the ED with positive UA but she denies any 
symptoms of dysuria or flank pain. Potentially not a true 
bacterial UTI but given truncated admission treated empirically 
with Cipro for 3 day course UCx pending on discharge. PCP 
confirmed she ___ follow up Cx post discharge
  
# R ankle pain.
Evaluated by orthopedics in the ED and found to be well healed 
from surgical fixation and low suspicion for intraarticular or 
hardware infection. Did have a fever in the ED but no 
leukocytosis and no signs or symptoms to suggest ankle or hip 
infection. 

# Social situation:
There is a long standing history of physical trauma at home 
secondary to aggressive behavior from daughter who per report 
has traumatic brain injury. Social work was consulted and filed 
for elder protective services. The patient already has visiting 
home services and outpatient social work has been involved in 
placing the daughter in a facility but the patient has been 
unwilling to sign the paperwork. I discussed this with PCP who 
indicated this has been ongoing for sometime, many people are 
already involved but the patient has been refusing to transition 
daughter out of the home. The patient is already receiving 
maximum services.
 
The patient was admitted to the medical floor only for a couple 
hours before she was discharged against medical advice. A work 
up for fever was incomplete but treated empirically for UTI with 
Cipro for 3 days. The patient remained coherent, clear and was 
able to clearly site the risks of being discharged against 
medical advice which include septic shock and death. I called 
and discussed with the patients PCP who will follow up UCx, 
resume outpatient services and continue to work with social work 
on patients home situation. 

Long standing medical illnesses are chronic and stable
# Seizure disorder
# Constipation
# Osteoporosis
Continued home meds

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
 
You were admitted from the emergency department with ankle pain, 
fever and concern for a urinary tract infection. You were 
admitted to the medical service but unfortunately you wanted to 
be discharged without further treatment or work up. We discussed 
the risks which include worsening infection including kidney 
infection, bone infection in your ankle and blood stream 
infection leading potentially to death if untreated. We also 
discussed concerns that you may suffer another fall with 
resulting injury at home. We feel you are unsafe to be 
discharged and you are leaving against medical advice. 
 
Please be advised our recommendation is for you to remain 
hospitalized and your decision is to leave against medical 
advice.
