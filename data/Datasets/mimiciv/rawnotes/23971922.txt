Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
___ with PMH of HLD and osteoporosis who presented to the ED as
a transfer from OSH with IPH and ___. Per family, patient was in
her usual state of health without any issues to their knowledge
as they had spoken with her the night prior to presentation.

Per OSH records, patient had rear ended 3 cars while driving
afternoon of ___, but did not recall the incident. She was
reportedly walking at the scene but was noted to be confused. 
She was taken to an outside hospital where she was noted to have
left parietal and occipital hematoma 5.4 x 5.2 x 3.6 cm in
___ as well as a small left-sided subdural hemorrhage 
with
5 mm of midline shift to the right, partial effacement of
quadrigeminal cisterns.  She received 10 mg IV Decadron as well
as 10 mg IV labetalol, and a chest CT showed no fractures or
pneumothorax.  She was then transferred to ___ for further
management.

She was initially evaluated by neurosurgery in the ED who
initially recommended no surgical intervention.  She was started
on nicardipine for blood pressure control, Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis, and was given a mannitol bolus.  Unfortunately,
patient had an episode of vomiting and was intubated for airway
protection.  Repeat head CT showed interval progression of the
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with progressive enlargement of the
hemorrhage and worsening of midline shift, concern for uncal
herniation.  Upon reevaluation by neurosurgery, team was
considering to offer hemicrani surgery.  However, upon further
discussion with patient's daughter and sister, who in the
meantime came to bedside, it was decided that surgery was not
within the goals of care.  Family requested that patient remain
intubated until other family members could arrive to see the
patient one last time.  After that, they plan on pursuing 
comfort
measures only.  Per discussion with daughter and sister at
bedside, patient was made DNR.  Family stressed the goal of
making the patient comfortable in the meantime.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head on ___ showed:
1. Progressive enlargement of left parieto-occipital 
intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage and worsening midline shift, now measuring 9 mm, 
previously 6 mm. 
2. Crowding of the left aspect of the suprasellar cistern again 
raises concern 
for uncal herniation. 
3. Stable left-sided subdural hematoma

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted for continued care of left 
parieto-occipital Intra parenchymal hemorrage and SDH.  She was 
hypertensive at the outside hospital, which may be an
etiology of her bleed; however given the size of the bleed, it 
is possible that she may have some undiagnosed underlying 
structural abnormality.

On admission, her condition, management options and prognosis 
were discussed with patients family. They declined surgery given 
her rapidly declining condition and wanted to wait for other 
family members (her husband) to arrive before making the patient 
comfort measures only.  She was continued on hypertonic saline 
and seizure prophylaxis with Keppra, as well as intubation while 
waiting for family members to arrive. No escalation of care per 
family's wishes. 
The following morning after family presented at bedside, goals 
of care were discussed and she was started on Comfort measures 
only. She was terminally extubated at approximately 12:35 on 
___.
She continued to decline and passed away on ___. Time of 
death 13:29. Family declined autopsy.
