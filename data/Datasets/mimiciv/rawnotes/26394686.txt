Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
#ERROR!
___ woman with a history of iron deficiency anemia, diabetes on 
metformin, and NASH cirrhosis child class B decompensated by 
ascites and previously with variceal bleed who presented with 
hematemesis and melena. She was intubated semi-electively for 
urgent EGD and admitted to the ICU. She was never 
hemodynamically unstable and did not require blood products. EGD 
revealed a non-bleeding poylp-like structure which is most 
likely source of bleeding. No varices were visualized. She was 
extubated on ___. She remained hemodynamically stable and 
had no further episodes of hematemesis or melena. She was 
monitored on the medical floor for 24 hours and then discharged 
home. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
#ERROR!
[ ] Imaging that needs to be addressed by PCP or hepatology
- Imaging from ___:
1. Cirrhotic liver containing two new segment IV lesions, which 
measure 1.8 cm and 1.4 cm and demonstrate arterial enhancement 
and washout but no pseudocapsule. Though findings do not meet 
strict OPTN-5 criteria, they are highly suspicious for 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
2. New 1.1 cm and 0.5 cm nonenhancing cystic lesions within the 
body of the pancreas are statistically side-branch IPMNs. These 
can be followed on subsequent surveillance studies. 
[ ] Patient needs to have EUS done as an outpatient with Dr. 
___ to further evaluate the gastric polyp that was 
seen on EGD. 
[ ] Patient requesting assistance from her PCP with setting up 
transportation for medical appointment in ___. 
[ ] Prior auth for her rifaximin has been approved but her copay 
is $900. ___ pharmacy will call the patient during the week to 
try and see if they can apply coupons to lower her copay. She 
has not been taking rifaxmin as an outpatient and has been 
managing her encephalopathy with lactulose only. Continue to try 
and assist patient to see if we can get her rifaximin at a 
reduced ___. 
[ ] Please repeat CBC at PCP ___ to ensure it is stable. 
[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ for strength training and 
___ for nursing assessment and medication teaching.

ACTIVE ISSUES

most likely source of bleeding. It was not bleeding. She 
received octreotide and PPI, never required pRBC transfusion. 
She was started on ceftriaxone which was transitioned to 
ciprofloxacin before d/c for 7 days for GIB in the setting of 
cirrhosis. 

# NASH Cirrhosis
Recent admission to ___ (about 2 months ago) with varices 
s/p banding, most recent EGD ___ did not reveal varices. 
Continued Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and transitioned to ___ at 
the time of discharge to complete 7 day course for prophylaxis. 
Continued lactulose and rifaximin, however she has been unable 
to get rifaximin as an outpatient due to high copays. No 
encephalopathy while admitted. 

# Mild hypoxia, resolved 
New 2L oxygen requirement after extubation. Lung exam 
significant for diminished lung sounds at the bases, Most likely 
atelectasis given no leukocytosis, fever, or focal findings. 
Monitored closely until resolved.
