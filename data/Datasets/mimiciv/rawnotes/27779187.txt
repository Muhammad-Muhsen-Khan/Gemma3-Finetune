IMAGING
-------
Left knee x-ray ___:
Expected post-operative appearance of the left knee.  No 
evidence of hardware related complications. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 
15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). 
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is some beat to beat 
variability ___ the ejection fraction due to irregular heart 
beats. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size is normal 
with borderline global free wall systolic function [Intrinsic 
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed 
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on 
the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or 
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild 
regional left ventricular dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral 
and tricuspid regurgitation, with likely depressed biventricular 
systolic function due to severity of regurgitation. Mild aortic 
regurgitation.  

RUQ ultrasound on admission:
1. No vascularity is seen ___ the region of the main portal vein, 
concerning 
for portal vein thrombosis. 
2. Cirrhotic liver morphology, without definite evidence of 
focal lesions. 
3. Minimal perihepatic ascites. 
4. Splenomegaly, measuring 13.7 cm.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male, s/p left total knee arthroplasty on ___,
and with history of alcoholic cirrhosis and atrial fibrillation,
who presents with two days of atraumatic left knee pain with 
MSSA
sepsis, prosthetic joint infection, atrial fibrillation with 
RVR,
acute kidney injury and decompensated liver failure.

# Prosthetic joint infection/septic knee
# MSSA sepsis: Blood and joint fluid growing MSSA.  s/p washout
on ___.   He is on cefazolin and rifampin, transitioned from IV
vancomycin initially. Hemodynamically stable. Serial blood
cultures have been negative.  ID and Orthopedic Surgery
following.  He has been getting regular albumin administration
for hydration, and received midodrine and octreotide to enhance
urine output. 
- continue cefazolin, rifampin, PICC line placed
- serial blood cultures-f/u final results-negative so far
- ID recs aprpeciated
- Orthopedic Surgery recs- dry sterile dressing, avoid extreme
flexion, outpatient follow up
-midodrine stopped ___, octreotide stopped ___
-PICC line placed, need ID follow up outpatient, weekly labs ___ 
form of CBC,BMP,LFT,INR,ESP,CRP weekly and results to be sent to 
OPAT lab.

#Diarrhea
resolved, resume lactulose
-cdiff negative,hold lactulose for diarrhea

# Decompensated cirrhosis, alcoholic: diagnosed one year ago. 
Patient is on furosemide at home.  RUQ ultrasound with evidence
of portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Some evidence of
encephalopathy, patient on lactulose for mild encephalopathy 
which is now completely resolved.  He
received octreotide, midodrine to enhance urine output and
prevent hepatorenal syndrome
- Concern about bilirubin getting worse though renal function
intact are reassuring, was on Coumadin on admission, likely had
vitamin K deficiency and difficult to interpret INR ___ the
setting of being on Coumadin outpatient and vitamin K deficiency
___ cirrhosis
- LFTs have now plateaued. He is instructed to f/u with his 
hepatologist at ___.
-monitor LFT,INR outpatient

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR
# Long-term use of anticoagulants
# Coagulopathy: HR 100s-140s after arrival.  Likely RVR from
infection.  He had resumed fast heart rates while ___ the PACU
after washout, now with better control. He was taking metoprolol 
25 XL at home, here has been getting 37.5 BID for rate control 
and he is rate controlled with that.  Patient does have 
superimposed coagulopathy from liver failure, INR > 2.  Coumadin 
not resumed on discharge due to INR being high even without any 
Coumadin, likely has concomitant vitamin K deficiency. Hold 
Coumadin for now, hopefully once nutrition status improves and 
Coumadin should be resumed outpatient, when INR trends down.
-  INR 2.6 even without any Coumadin
-resumed daily aspirin on discharge
 
# Acute kidney injury: creatinine uptrended after washout, ?
component of hepatorenal syndrome.  Also likely element of ATN
from sepsis. creatinine trended down
- Creatinine is stable, monitor
-resolved, consider resuming Lasix ___ ___ days if sodium remains 
stable 

# Hyponatremia:  Likely multifactorial. He has history of
alcoholic cirrhosis, and has been volume depleted. Initially 
sodium improved with Iv fluids and albumin, octretide and 
midodrine. Diuretics were restarted and sodium trended low. ___ 
between he also has increased loss ___ form of diarrhea. Urine 
osmolarity > 500, and urine sodium less than 20. Likely dealing 
with a mixed picture with cirrhosis, low solute intake,? SIADH 
like picture along with a component of hypovolemia. He seems 
euvolemic and infact beginning to get ___ edema now. 
-recommend BMP ___ ___ days and if sodium same restart Lasix, 
continue fluid restriction of less than 1.5 litres. 

# Thrombocytopenia: has been slightly below baseline.  Likely
from alcoholic cirrhosis, now with superimposed infection.
Platelets low but stable

# Hypertension: stable on metoprolol

#Hypomagnesemia
improved

I have spoken to his PCP on the phone and notified him about the 
transitional issues.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission to 
___.  You came for further evaluation of knee pain, and were 
found to have an infection ___ your left knee, as well as 
bacterial ___ your blood stream.  ___ addition, you were found to 
be ___ decompensated liver failure, and had a very fast heart 
rate.  You were placed on antibiotics and had a washout of your 
knee, all which eventually improved your condition.

It is very important that you continue to take all medications 
as prescribed and follow up with the appointments listed below.  
It is also extremely important that you no longer drink alcohol, 
as it will only worsen the condition of your liver failure.

Good luck!
