Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
#ERROR!
[] Amiodarone 200mg BID for one month (started ___, then 
decrease to 200 mg daily.
[] Will need repeat PFTs, LFTs, TSH at 6 months.
[] Decreased simvastatin from 40mg to 20mg due to possible 
interaction with amiodarone.
[] TTE with newly reduced EF from 52% to 33% with global LV 
hypokinesis, c/f possibly tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. 
Recommend re-echo once rates better controlled; defer further 
work up to outpatient cardiology at the request of patient

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
#ERROR!
___ male with a history of interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary hypertension, HFpEF, and atrial fibrillation (on 
Eliquis), BPH who presented with worsening shortness of breath 
over the last week. He was diuresed with 40mg IV Lasix, and 
symptoms improved significantly. While in the hospital, he was 
also initiated on amiodarone for anti-arrhythmic therapy for his 
Atrial Fibrillation.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
# Dyspnea on exertion
# Acute on Chronic HF with newly reduced EF. 
Mr. ___ presented with dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity 
edema, and mild weight gain, which was consistent with heart 
failure exacerbation. However, BNP not significant elevated and 
weight stable from prior. He was empirically treated with IV 
diuretics (20 mg Lasix x2) in the ED with improvement in his 
DOE. Repeat TTE was performed on the day of discharge which 
showed LVEF 33% from prior 52% in ___ with moderate LV global 
hypokinesis w c/f non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. This was 
attributed to his poorly controlled afib/aflutter w concern for 
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Given that he was euvolemic, 
with resolution of symptoms, had f/u with cardiology ___, and 
patient strong preference despite counseling of benefit, his 
newly reduced EF was not worked up further while inpatient, 
including other labs, imaging, and w/u for CAD.

# AFib/AFlutter
Patient was evaluated by cardiology and concern was that his 
DOE, possibly new CHF (later confirmed on TTE on the day of 
discharge), and previously uncontrolled HR was due to an 
inadequate rate-control strategy and that rhythm control was 
altogether preferable. As such, he was initiated on Amiodarone 
on ___, with a plan to continue 200mg BID for one month, then 
decrease to 200 mg daily. He also continued his home dose of 
metoprolol and Eliquis. Notably, in the context of his ILD, he 
will need close PFT and CXR monitoring to ensure no progression 
while on amiodarone.

#Interstitial lung disease, on ___ L NC O2 at home
Mr. ___ has a history of ILD, and was recently started on 
long prednisone taper empirically for possible NSIP. His 
prednisone was decreased from 40mg to 20mg two weeks prior to 
admission by his PCP, after discussion with his pulmonology 
team. However, in this context, he did not have 
worsening/progression of his CT findings but in fact altogether 
had some improvement of bibasilar GGOs, suggesting a steroid 
responsive process. He was continued on Prednisone 20mg in the 
hospital, and prophylaxis with atovaquone, pantoprazole 40 mg 
daily. He will f/u pulmonary ___ for continuation of 
prednisone course.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
# PVD
Patient continued his home clopidogrel and pentoxifylline.

# BPH
Patient continued his home Tamsulosin.
