History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old woman with untreated SLE who was
 transferred to the ___ ED via medflight from ___
 ___ after a cardiac arrest. Per report, the patient was
 found after a low-speed MVC after her car rolled up over a curb
 and hit a granite mailbox. When police arrived she was
 unresponsive and pulseless so AED was applied, shock was
 indicated, and she was shocked with ROSC after 1 shock. Her
 pupils were noted to be pinpoint so she received narcan without
 effect. There was a question of seizure activity/decorticate
 posturing and she was altered by the time she arrived at the 
OSH
 so she was intubated with etomidate/rocuronium and given Keppra
 and started on fentanyl and propofol. ECG reportedly showed
 lateral ST depressions but she remained hemodynamically stable.
 On arrival to ___ she had CT scans that showed no head or 
neck
 fracture or hemorrhage. Her repeat ECG showed no evidence of
 STEMI. Her initial labs revealed a leukocytosis with WBC 15.1,
 normal hemoglobin, mildly elevated transaminases, troponin
 elevated to 0.18, normal renal function and unremarkable
 electrolytes. Her basic toxicology was negative. Per her 
family,
 in the days and weeks leading up to this event she had 
described
 no new physical complaints other than mild right arm pain and
 some pleuritic right chest wall discomfort, with no complaints
of chest pressure, dyspnea, palpitations, lightheadedness, or
 syncope. She has not seen a doctor in over ___ years.

Upon arrival to ___, the patient was noted to have the
following:   

In the ED, initial vitals were:  
 97.2 108 119/63 22 100% intubated 
  
 - Exam notable for: 
 Primary survey was unremarkable.  Her secondary survey was
notable for GCS 3 T.

- Labs notable for:  
 -leukocytosis to 15, ALT 240, AST 284, Trop 0.18

- Imaging was notable for:
 -rib fractures from CPR or MVC 
 -EKG with STD 

She was seen by the post arrest team who recommended TTM if
patient not following commands off sedation with goal 
temperature
of 36C for 48h.  

Trauma surgery evaluated the patient and did not think there was
any traumatic injuries. 

- Patient was given:   
nothing  
 
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient is intubated but having
decordicate posturing and noted to have tongue biting and rapid
eye movement and given 2mg Ativan.    

Review of systems was negative except as detailed above.

IMAGING:
========
EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of diffuse background slowing indicative of a 
moderate encephalopathy, nonspecific as to etiology. Medication 
effects, toxic/metabolic disturbances and/or infection are among 
the most common causes. There are two pushbutton activation for 
unclear reason. There are no electrographic seizures. 

CT C-spine ___. No definite fracture or traumatic alignment abnormality. 
2. Subtle anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 likely chronic though in 
the absence of priors clinical correlation advised. 
3. Subtle punctate hyperdensity anterior to the superior 
endplate of C5, 
likely chronic.  No definite prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  
Evaluation somewhat limited given intubated state.  Please 
correlate clinically. 

CT head ___
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.

CT chest/abd/pelvis ___. Subtle fat stranding along the right renal pelvis and 
proximal ureter may reflect blood products without definite 
evidence of injury to the collecting system. 
2. Minimally displaced fractures of the anterior left 6 and ___ 
ribs. 
3. Posterior dependent opacities in the lungs likely 
atelectasis, with 
possible component of aspiration. 
4. ET tube positioned 1.6 cm above the carina.  ___ consider 
slight retraction for more optimal positioning. 
5. Fibroid uterus. 

Lower-extremity US ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is normal left ventricular wall
thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional 
and global left ventricular systolic function. The
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with 
depressed free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter
is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
with mild posterior leaflet systolic prolapse. There
is an eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild [1+] mitral 
regurgitation. Due to the Coanda effect, the severity
of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal.
There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
is no pericardial effusion.

MRI Brain ___
FINDINGS:  
  
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, 
midline shift or infarction.   The ventricles and sulci are 
normal in caliber and 
configuration.  The major intracranial flow voids are preserved. 
 The sphenoid sinus is opacified.  There is mild-to-moderate 
mucosal thickening of the remaining paranasal sinuses. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Normal study 

Corornary angiogram ___
No angiographically significant coronary artery disease.

EP Procedure Note ___
left cephalic vein
___ RVA
ICd
closure ___ vicryl sub q x ___ vicryl cutis x 1
no complications

TTE ___
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
55-60%. The right ventricle has normal free wall motion. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. 
The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened with mild posterior leaflet 
systolic prolapse. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trivial residual pericardial effuion. Normal 
biventricular systolic function. Mild posterior MVP.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of SLE who presented as transfer to the MICU 
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest on ___ s/p 1 shock with 
ROSC. She underwent targeted temperature management and required 
brief intubation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
and agitation. Later transferred to the CCU. She underwent an EP 
study ___ to look for an arrhythmogenic focus suitable to 
ablation but none was found. Had AICD placed at the same time. 
Procedure complicated by hemopericardium with tamponade, 
resolved with temporary drain placement. Hospital course also 
c/b HAP/VAP, treated with broad-spectrum abx. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#VF cardiac arrest
Patient presented after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest where she 
was found unresponsive and pulseless after a low-speed MVC s/p 
one shock with ROSC. Trauma pan-scan was negative. AED strips 
demonstrated VF. Etiology thought to be R-on-T as other work-up 
was unrevealing; TTE showed normal ventricular function, cavity 
size, and wall thickness, coronary angiogram was negative for 
occlusive disease, and EKGs demonstrated normal QT interval. 
Serum tox screen negative. ___ without DVT. She underwent TTM 
after 48h. EP study performed on ___ found no focus for 
ablation, ICD was placed. Was started initially on nadolol 
40mg/day, but later switched to  verapamil 40mg Q8H (given her 
hypotension) for idiopathic VT/VF prophylaxis.

#Hemopericardium
#Cardiac tamponade
EP procedure complicated by hemopericardium with cardiac 
tamponade, addressed with pericardial drain placement, which was 
removed prior to discharge, with bedside echo showing resolution 
of pericardial effusion. Started on colchicine 0.6mg daily to 
decrease pericardial inflammation.   

#Hypotension
Patient briefly required pressors while intubated and sedated, 
thought possibly due to the hemodynamic effects of sedation. No 
evidence of cardiogenic shock. Intraprocedural hypotension ___ 
tamponade as above. At time of discharge, her BP was ___ 
(unknown baseline), with good mentation.   

#Neurologic status
Patient was evaluated with EEG after presentation for c/f 
seizures precipitating the MVC. Per Neurology, she had no 
seizure activity clinically or electrographically. MRI also 
showed no intracranial abnormality.

#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
Patient required intubation on arrival to ___ for altered 
mental status with c/f seizure activity. CT torso showed basilar 
consolidations, likely aspiration pneumonitis vs PNA, and she 
was treated with a 7-day course of IV CTX for presumed HAP/VAP. 
Her mental status improved as sedation was weaned, and she was 
extubated successfully on ___.

#Bacterial conjunctivitis 
Found to have bacterial conjunctivitis in R eye, treated with 
ciprofloxacin drops Q4H x 5 days. Last dose should be afternoon 
of ___.
