surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

hypotension, which he responded to appropriately. His magnesium 
was 1.5 and was given mg sulfate IV. On POD#2, his magnesium was 
2.0.

accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and
