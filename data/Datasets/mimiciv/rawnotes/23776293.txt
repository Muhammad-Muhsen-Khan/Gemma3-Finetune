Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with history of ___ 
disease and fronto-temporal dementia with behavioral disturbance 
who presented with acute on chronic agitation, found to have 
subdural hygroma and fever.

#ERROR!
ACUTE ISSUES
#ERROR!
# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy 
# Acute on chronic agitation: 
# Dementia: Patient presented with acute on chronic agitation. 
Patient was febrile, and agitation may have been related to 
infection. Infectious evaluation was notable for urine culture 
that grew S. anginosis, although it is unclear if this was 
pathogenic. CXR without pneumonia. Influenza swab negative. 
Lumbar puncture was obtained after the patient was initiated on 
empiric meningitis therapy and therefore the results were 
difficult to determine. However, overall the clinical suspicion 
for meningoencephalitis was low, and with the consultation of 
Infectious Disease, antibiotics and antiviral were de-escalated 
and discontinued. Patient was noted to have B12 deficiency that 
could contribute to neurologic symptoms but is unlikely to fully 
account for her presentation; the patient was initiated on B12 
supplementation. The patient was noted to have a frontal subdral 
hygroma, which given its location may be contributing to 
patient's behavioral changes although there was no evidence of 
mass effect. EEG was without seizure activity. MRI was limited 
due to motion artifact. Over time, the patient's agitation 
improved. Psychiatry was consulted for assistance with 
medication management, and the patient was initiated on 
gabapentin 100 mg QHS with mild improvement in Sx, though pt 
continued to have waxing-waning mental status. After ___ 
discussion, pt's husband/HCP desiring for acute rehab stay with 
goal of eventually getting wife back home, though understanding 
that this may not end up being possible. Desiring for pt to 
remain full code for now, will have family discussion after 
discharge.

# Fever, resolved
# Possible S. anginosis urinary tract infection:
# Possible meningoencephalitis: As above, patient was noted to 
be febrile on admission and underwent extensive infectious 
evaluation that was notable for Strep anginosis in the urine and 
equivocal CSF findings that were obtained after the initiation 
of antibiotics and antivirals. Ultimately, all antibiotics were 
discontinued and the patient remained afebrile.

# Hypoxia: Patient noted to have oxygen saturations in low ___ 
on room air throughout hospital course. CXR without evidence of 
pulmonary pathology. Ultimately, this was thought to be due to 
atelectasis.

# Subdural hygroma: Found on initial imaging, possibly 
contributing to change in mental status. Patient was seen by 
neurosurgery, who thought that there was no need for 
intervention at this time. An MRI was obtained to further 
evaluate, but was limited due to motion artifact.

# B12 deficiency: Patient noted to have B12 deficiency. Started 
on B12 supplementation 1000 mcg weekly (___) x1 month (Last 
day: ___ then monthly thereafter

CHRONIC ISSUES

# ___ disease: Patient noted to have cogwheel rigidity 
on exam. Patient previously trialed Sinemet in ___, but this 
was stopped due to side effects.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
#ERROR!
- Medication changes:
-- Started on gabapentin 100 mg QHS for agitation; consider 
gradual uptitration
-- Pt may benefit from geriatric psychiatry consult for 
assistance in titrating home psych meds, can consider decreasing 
Sertraline vs Mirtazipine to increase daylight activity, though 
need balance night-time sedation
-- Started on B12 supplementation 1000 mcg weekly (___) x1 
month (Last day: ___ then monthly thereafter
-- Consider discontinuing aspirin and atorvastatin given 
difficulties taking pills, age, and other comorbidities
-- Would encourage continuing ___/code status discussions
