Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT: Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a 
past medical history of Alzheimer's dementia, post-polio

# Acute metabolic encephalopathy
# Decompensated Alzheimer's dementia
# Acute on chronic weakness
# Post-polio syndrome/neurologic deficits.
# Poor oral intake
Patient presented with increased lethargy from baseline. At 
baseline, patient has minimal conversation. Weakness is 
characterized by inability to transfer by self and is wheelchair 
bound. Patient improved from initial presentation and was 
approaching his baseline prior to discharge. Patient was treated

poor oral intake, infection, and medication effect (losartan). 
Hold losartan on discharge pending outpatient provider follow 
up. 

# Essential Hypertension. Hold losartan
