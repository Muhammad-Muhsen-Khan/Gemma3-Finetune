___ NP admission not for full details. In brief, 
patient was referred to ___ Cardiology in ___ after initially

intubated. Access during the case left and right arterial 
sheaths pulled and sealed with angioseal. Left femoral venous 
sheath in place upon CCU transfer. Further more, during case Hct

POST-TAVR ECHO
ECHO ___: LVEF ___
Aortic peak velocity 2.2 m/sec; peak gradient 15 mm Hg; mean

ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the 
mid to apical anterior wall, mid to apical septum, and entire 
inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. A ___ 3 aortic valve 
bioprosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears 
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular

multivessel CAD. Normal right ventricular cavity size and 
systolic function. Well-seated bioprosthetic aortic prosthesis 
with mild aortic regurgitation and small paravalvular leak.

hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, an 
aortic bioprosthesis is present. Regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction is new with a decline in ejection fraction. 
There is more mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery pressures 
are higher.  

FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND:

pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula.  There is a small hematoma 
adjacent to the left common femoral artery measuring 2.8 cm. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx of ESRD intermittently on HD, HTN, GERD, T2DM, 
severe AS referred to ___ for TAVR on ___, with procedure 
complicated by transient ischemic changes on telemetry and 
hypotension during valve passage briefly requiring pressors, 
transferred to the CCU intubated for further management. Patient 
intubated in setting of GA for TAVR. During valve passage across 
aortic stenosis patient experienced transient STE ischemic 
changes on telemetry with associated hypotension thought to be 
related to transient coronary hypoperfusion during valve 
passage. Per report, patient never lost a pulse but required 
chest compressions for 2 minutes until action of pressors. Prior 
to arrival to CCU, pressors weaned. Upon arrival in the CCU, pt 
was intubated, sedated, but was extubated after passing SBT. 
With his new O2 requirement and pulmonary edema seen on CXR, the 
patient was diuresed with 200 mg of IV Lasix and placed on a 
Lasix gtt. Problem list while in CCU included:

   #Anemia. Hct droped during procedure from 29 to 21 during 
procedure, and pt received 1 unit pRBC. CT A/P during case did 
not reveal obvious source of bleeding. Left and right arterial 
access sites closed with angioseal with good hemostasis per 
report. Upon arrival in the CCU, pt received additional 1U pRBC, 
with appropriate bump in H/H. Transfusions were given with 
Lasix, as pt was hypervolemic on physical exam and had pulmonary 
edema on CXR with O2 requirement. He was diuresed with 200mg IV 
Lasix bolus and then started on IV Lasix 10 gtt. The patient 
also had a left hematoma and an ultrasound was performed that 
did not show pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula.  There was a small 
hematoma adjacent to the left common femoral artery measuring 
2.8 cm.

   #Severe AS s/p TAVR. Valve dynamics: Mean gradient of 32 
mmHg, peak gradient of 55 mmHg, and a calculated aortic valve 
area of 0.8 cm2. Patient underwent TAVR on ___. Procedure was 
complicated by transient ischemic and hypotension as above. 
Patient was monitored on telemetry and with daily EKG to monitor 
for post-TAVR complications including new BB morphology and PR 
prolongation. He received cefazolin 2g q8h for 2 doses 
post-procedure. He was started on ASA 81mg and Plavix 75mg.

   #CAD//HFrEF. 3V Disease, with 100% LAD occlusion, Left Cx 
40-50% proximal, 60% distal lesion, RCA 80-90% mid and 60-70% 
distal lesion. EF ___. Post TAVR EKG demonstrating Q waves in 
III, new from prior. Sinus bradycardia likely in the setting of 
propofol. Patient was diuresed with IV Lasix as above for volume 
management. He was continued on ASA, Plavix as above. Patient 
should be considered for need for cardiac catheterization for 
RCA lesion this admission   

   #ESRD intermittently on HD, with LUE fistula. Not anuric. 
Last HD in ___ after undergoing cardiac cath. Fistula 
active. Per report, patient not interested in pursuing dialysis. 
K 3.8. Patient was continued VitD3, Calcitrol, Sodium Bicarb. 

Patient was then transferred to ___ 3 for further management. 
Patient continued on ASA/Plavix for AS and repeat echocardiogram 
post-TAVR showed reduced LVEF to ___, peak gradient 19 mmHg, 
mean gradient 11 mmHg and ___ measurement of 2.2 cm2. He was 
started on low dose Metoprolol tartrate for HFrEF at 12.5 mg 
daily, no Lisinopril given chronic kidney disease and creatinine 
rise to 6.1 on admission. He is on ASA, and started on 
Atorvastatin. His hematoma stabilized and no further blood 
transfusions were required. Renal was consulted for his anemia 
no dialysis was indicated. With continued decrease in levels, he 
was given Procrit 5000 units on day of discharge and follow-up 
with his outpatient nephrologist. He will need high risk PCI in 
the future and will follow-up with Dr. ___.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ because you had transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Continue all your current medications with the following change:
  START Plavix 75 mg daily (for three months)
  START ASA 81 mg daily, lifelong
  START Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg twice/day
  DECREASE Furosemide to 20 mg daily
 
It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking aspirin and 
clopidogrel (also known as Plavix). These two medications keep 
blood clots from forming on the new valve. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming on your new valve. This could cause it to malfunction 
and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking either 
medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if another 
doctor tells you to stop the medications.

Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change.

We have made changes to your medication list, so please make 
sure to take your medications as directed. You will also need to 
have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary 
care doctor.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you the best with 
your health!
