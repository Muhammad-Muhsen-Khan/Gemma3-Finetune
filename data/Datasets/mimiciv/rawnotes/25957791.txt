p-MIBI ___
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old IDDM inactive woman s/p 
pacemaker
in ___ with a history of HTN and HLD was referred to the 
lab for
evaluation of atypical chest discomfort. The patient was infused 
with
0.4mg/5ml of regadenoson over 20 seconds, followed immediately 
by
isotope infusion. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was 
reported
by the patient throughout the study. There were no significant 
ST
segment changes during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm 
was
sinus with no ectopy. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the 
infusion
and recovery. The regadenoson was reversed with 20 mg of 
caffeiene IV.

IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ST segment changes. 
Nuclear
report sent separately.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
For pharmacologic stress 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was 
infused
intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush.
 
FINDINGS:  Left ventricular cavity size is ___nd stress perfusion images reveal uniform a small fixed 
defect along the
apex, with otherwise normal tracer uptake throughout the left 
ventricular
myocardium.
 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 61%
 
IMPRESSION: 1. Mild apical defect may be artifactual.  No real 
evidence of
ischemia.

TTE ___:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 58 %. 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Normal biventricular cavity 
sizes and regional/global systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified. Normal estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of 
microvascular angina, pSVT s/p ablation, 2:1 heart, block s/p 
PPM, carotid stenosis, HTN, HLD, DM here with chest pain.

# Chest pain
Her chest pain had certain features concerning for cardiac 
etiology: radiating to the neck and worse with exertion. 
However, other features were less consistent with cardiac 
etiology: worse with deep breath and exacerbated by certain 
positional changes. Her troponins were negative and pMIBI was 
negative, making ischemia extremely unlikely. PE was unlikely 
given absence of risk factors (Well's score 0). Pericarditis was 
thought possible given recent PPM placement, so a TTE was done 
which was pending at discharge. Musculoskeletal pain was also 
possible; patient was advised to take Tylenol or NSAIDs for 
pain. Please follow-up with her pain as an outpatient and 
consider amitriptyline or muscle spasm medication (such as 
hyoscyamine) for her pain.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Palpitations
Recurrent, do not appear improved after pacemaker placement. 
Patient was previously on metoprolol but discontinued it due to 
fatigue. She had no significant arrhythmia on telemetry here.

# Carotid stenosis
Stable bilateral carotid stenosis on CTA head/neck in ED. No
focal neurologic signs. She was continued on aspirin. Will need 
cholesterol management. Consider a PCSK-9 given a history of 
allergy to statin.

# Hypertension
Blood pressure suboptimal here- was as high as SBP 140s. Patient 
reports her BP has worsened since pacemaker was placed. Consider 
re-starting an agent for blood pressure control; please note 
multiple allergies to medications.

# IDDM
Poorly controlled, last A1c 9.1%. Continued home lantus and 
HISS.

# HLD 
Consideration of PSK-9 inhibitor outpatient per above. The most 
recent lipid values on ___, were total cholesterol 148 
mg/dL, triglycerides 160, HDL 46 and calculated LDL 70.

Transitional Issues
#ERROR!
[] Please follow-up pending TTE to evaluate for possible 
pericardial effusion given recent instrumentation to heart. This 
could be a possible cause for her chest pain.
[] Consider additional medication for chest pain as above 
(hyoscyamine, amitriptyline).
[] Patient should ideally be on both better BP control and 
cholesterol meds, please consider trialing nifedipine for BP and 
assessing side effects (significant swelling with amlodipine) 
and consider PSK-9 inhibitor given history of allergic reaction 
to atorvastatin
[] Please discuss advance directives with patient. She stated to 
the medical team that she would like to be DNR/DNI. That for 
her, the risk of
ending up with a disability or hooked to machines makes the 
attempt at resuscitation not worth it. However, patient did not 
fill out any paperwork stating thus (i.e., MOLST form).

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

Why were you admitted?
- You were admitted for chest pain

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- We did a stress test (p-mibi) of your heart, which was normal
- We also repeated an echocardiogram of your heart. The result 
is still pending at discharge but will be followed up by your 
cardiologist.
- We do not believe that your chest pain is related to any clots 
or decreased blood flow to the heart.
- Your chest pain could be related to inflammation of the 
membranes around your heart or related to the muscles and bones 
in your chest. You can take Tylenol or ibuprofen for this pain 
and talk to your cardiologist at your follow-up appointment.

What should you do when you get home?
- You should take all of your medications as prescribed.
- You should attend all of your scheduled appointments. You have 
a follow-up appointment with both your cardiologist and your 
primary care provider.

It was a pleasure taking care of you! We wish you all the ___.
- Your ___ Team
