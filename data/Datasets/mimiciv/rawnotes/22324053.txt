History of Present Illness:
___ male who has a longstanding wound involving in his 
left medial ankle since the 1980s.  At that time, he had fallen 
from a ladder and fractured his ankle.  He was treated with open 
reduction and internal fixation.  This was complicated by 
hardware infection.  His hardware was subsequently removed and 
he was treated with antibiotics, and left with an open wound.  
Since that time he has had an open wound of the left medial 
ankle.  He has been managing in the wound care center and he has 
also had a previous skin graft.  However, despite these 
interventions, he has been left on a chronic wound for decades.  
He now presents for more definitive management.

IMAGING:
Radiology Report ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT Study Date of 
___ 4:05 ___ 
IMPRESSION:  
Deformity of the distal tibia likely reflects remote trauma with 
malunion of a fracture.  There are moderately severe 
degenerative changes at the tibiotalar joint and varus 
angulation of the foot
.
 ___ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Conclusions  
The left atrial volume index is severely increased. The right 
atrium is markedly dilated. There is severe symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 68 %. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall 
is hypertrophied. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient 
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
IMPRESSION: 
1) Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy likely due to 
infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
2) Moderate tricuspid regurgitation in setting of normal RV 
size/function and at least mild pulmonary hypertension. There is 
a suggestion of significant PVR elevation since pulmonary 
acceleration time is short with mid-systolic notching and low 
VTI of pulmonary venous flow envelop.   
.
Radiology Report RENAL U.S. Study Date of ___ 8:47 AM 
FINDINGS:  
The right kidney measures 10.5 cm. The left kidney measures 11.2 
cm.  There is a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm lower right kidney exophytic 
thin-walled, circumscribed predominantly anechoic cyst without 
vascularity.  There is no hydronephrosis or calculus 
bilaterally.  Normal cortical echogenicity and corticomedullary 
differentiation are seen bilaterally.  
The bladder is moderately well distended and unremarkable in 
appearance. 
Bilateral ureteral jets are seen.  
IMPRESSION:   
The right renal cystic lesion is likely a hemorrhagic cyst given 
ultrasound findings and hyperdensity on CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) chronic medial left ankle wound
Patient was admitted to plastic surgery service on ___ and 
underwent irrigation and debridement of left medial ankle wound 
including skin and subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, and 
bone.  Samples were sent to microbiology and pathology for 
further evaluation.  Patient had daily wound care of left ankle 
wound until next debridement in OR on ___.  On ___, 
patient went to OR for Pedicled, islandized dorsalis pedis 
neurocutaneous flap and a Split-thickness skin graft coverage of 
donor defect.  He was maintained on strict bedrest until POD#5 
when dangle protocol was commenced and tolerated well.  Patient 
had flap checks per protocol.  On POD#7, bulky OR dressing and 
bolster were taken down.  Incisions were clean and without 
evidence of infection.  Flap site with superior area of ischemia 
noted.  Skin graft with 100% take.  Patient was re-dressed with 
fresh dressings and placed in a posterior splint.
.
2) atrial fibrillation/cardiac amyloidosis
Patient was maintained on telemetry. Patient was initially 
started on therapeutic lovenox post-operatively on ___ and 
was transitioned to heparin IV on ___ in anticipation of 
further surgical intervention.  A medicine consult was obtained 
post-operatively from ___ OR in anticipation of a 
potentially long reconstructive surgery.  Due to significant 
cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, medicine felt that a 
Cardiology consult was warranted to so this was also obtained.  
Cardiology gave pre-operative recommendations regarding the 
potential for prolonged procedure and management during general 
anesthesia.  Patient was thus switched from lovenox to heparin 
gtt per Cardiology recommendation.  After last surgery on 
___, patient was transitioned back to therapeutic lovenox and 
discharged home on same.  Coumadin will be held until seen for 
follow up evaluation.
.
3) osteomyelitis
Patient was maintained on cefazolin IV until an ID consult was 
obtained on ___ and antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin 
1g q12h, CefePIME 2g q12h, and metronidazole 500mg q8h PO while 
awaiting OR culture data.  Micro data from surgical bone 
specimen on ___ revealed PsA (pan-S), citrobacter (R: cefazolin, 
Augmentin), MSSA, Providentia spp. (R: augmentin), Bacteroides 
(R: amp), and Myroides spp. (S: cipro and tigecycline only). ID 
recommended a total of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy so a PICC 
line was placed and vancomycin was discontinued in favor of 
daptomycin; cefepime and flagyl were maintained.
.
4) Rash
On POD#6, patient was noted to have a red, non-pruritic rash on 
his back and buttocks area.  Yeast rash ___ area.  The areas 
were cleansed and then aquaphor ointment and micostatin powder 
were applied TID.
