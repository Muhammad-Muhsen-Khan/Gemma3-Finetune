___ CT CHEST W/CONTRAST
1. Multiple indeterminate pulmonary nodules, largest measures 
0.4 cm.
2. Multiple hepatic lesions, predominantly present cysts.  1.8 
cm indeterminate hepatic lesion in the caudate lobe, consider 
MRI in further evaluation if indicated.

___  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO
1. Findings consistent with colitis involving the left colon. 
2. Focal intussusception of the sigmoid colon without associated 
bowel obstruction.  Given intussusception, colonoscopy must be 
performed to exclude underlying mass. 
3. Multiple hepatic hypodensities likely a combination of cysts 
and 
hemangiomas. 
(Normal CT ABD PELVIS ON ___

___ CXR (PA & LAT):
- Mild interstitial edema without focal consolidation.

___  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
- No acute intracranial process. 
- 8 mm focal subcortical right frontal hypodensity is 
nonspecific, but appears old and may relate to prior ischemia.  
MRI is more sensitive in detecting acute ischemia and small 
intracranial lesions. 
- The right globe is elongated and asymmetrically larger than 
the left. Correlate with myopia or other chronic process. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with history of 
hypertension and chronic abdominal pain who presented to the 
___ ED ___ with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, 
diarrhea and an episode of weakness and confusion found to have 
colitis and intussusception. History notable for acute abdominal 
pain 1 week prior to admission, with fever up to 104, headache, 
black tarry bowel movements. Chronic use of NSAIDs and recent 
travel. Imaging notable for sigmoid intussusception and left 
colon colitis. Etiology of intussusception concerning for mass 
effect. Colitis is worrisome for infection vs ischemia vs 
inflammation/ diverticulitis(especially given chronic abdominal 
pain worsening with food and what seemed to be a TIA in the ED). 
Given recent NSAID use and travel, also concern for 
h.pylori/ulcer. Colonoscopy showed congestion in descending 
colon consistent with colitis, and a large 8cm polyp in the 
sigmoid colon. Biopsy was sent from the polyp and throughout the 
colon as rush path, preliminarily tubular villous adenoma. CEA 
2.3. Positive H. pylori serum Ag. GI and CRS following. Plan OR 
___ for lap sig colectomy.

#Abdominal mass
#Colitis
#Abdominal pain
Etiology likely ___ to 8cm mass causing intussusception leading 
to ?ischemic colitis. Currently stable with no pain. Laproscipic 
sigmoid colectomy. Also found to have + h. pylori serum antigen. 


#AMS: Question of Stroke
Has returned to baseline as of admission. Neuro exam normal. 
Hypodensities noted on head CT c/f old infarcts. Neurology 
consulted and recommend follow-up after discharge but no further 
MRI workup at this time.

#HTN: On home Enalapril Maleate 20 mg PO daily. Held because of 
possible GIB.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Follow up biopsy results
- Will need Neurology follow up for head CT findings and 
possible MRI (8 mm focal subcortical right frontal hypodensity, 
nonspecific, but appears old and may relate to prior ischemia.  
MRI is more sensitive in detecting acute ischemia and small 
intracranial lesions.).
- Will need fasting lipid profile (LDL 146 on ___, unclear if 
this was fasting), if LDL remains elevated, start on Atorva 40.
- Will need GI f/u for MRI evaluation of 1.8 cm indeterminate 
hepatic lesion in the caudate lobe found on CT.
- Will need CT follow up in ___ for CT chest findings of 
multiple indeterminate pulmonary nodules, largest measures 0.4 
cm.
- Positive H.pylori serology, stool antigen pending; will need 
confirmation of active infection and trtmt

Mrs. ___ was admitted to the colorectal surgery service 
post-operatively. On the first day after surgery she tolerated 
clear liquids and was able to void after foley catheter removal. 
She was doing very well. Intravenous fluids were stopped. She 
was given oral pain medication. On ___ she had passed flatus 
and tolerated a regular diet. She was discharged home in stable 
condition. She met with an interpreter and the nursing staff to 
review her discharge instruction.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
 
You were admitted to the hospital after a Laparoscopic resection 
of the proximal rectum and distal sigmoid colon for surgical 
management of your Colon polyp causing obstruction. You have 
recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to 
return home. Samples of tissue were taken and this tissue has 
been sent to the pathology department for analysis. You will 
receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. 
If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you 
regarding these results they will contact you before this time. 
You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain 
is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return 
home to finish your recovery.  
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patient_x0092_s to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office.

If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
for advice ___: 
fever greater than 101.5
increasing abdominal distension
increasing abdominal pain 
nausea/vomiting
inability to tolerate food or liquids
prolonged loose stool
extended constipation  
inability to urinate

Incisions:
You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures. These are healing well 
however it is important that you monitor these areas for signs 
and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of the 
incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, 
increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at 
the incision, or swelling of the area.

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. 
The small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with 
steri-strips (little white adhesive strips), these will fall off 
over time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or 
swimming until cleared by the surgical team. 

Pain
It is expected that you will have pain after surgery and this 
pain will gradually improved over the first week or so you are 
home. You will especially have pain when changing positions and 
with movement. You should continue to take 2 Extra Strength 
Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around the clock and you 
may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every hours for 7 days. 
Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or 
any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take 
Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your 
pain to a point where you can ambulate and preform minor tasks, 
you should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication 
Oxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take 
with any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a 
car if taking narcotic pain medications. 

Activity
You may feel weak or "washed out" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 
weeks. You may climb stairs. You may go outside and walk, but 
avoid traveling long distances until you speak with your 
surgical team at your first follow-up visit. Your surgical team 
will clear you for heavier exercise and activity as the observe 
your progress at your follow-up appointment. You should only 
drive a car on your own if you are off narcotic pain medications 
and feel as if your reaction time is back to normal so you can 
react appropriately while driving.
