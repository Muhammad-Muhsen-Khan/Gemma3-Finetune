HOSPITAL COURSE
#ERROR!
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with anaplastic 
astrocytoma who presented with intractable severe headache in 
the setting of recent corticosteroid taper, found to have 
minimal truncal rash within dermatome.

ACTIVE ISSUES
#ERROR!
# Headache
Presented with severe, intractable headache. CT w/o change in 
astrocytoma. Given recent steroid taper, suspect migraine as 
underlying etiology; seems to have improved with resumption of 
higher steroid dose. Of note, patient also initiated avastin on 
___ which causes headaches in up to 49% of persons and could 
be contributing to the overall picture. Was receiving 4mg dex IV 
BID inpatient, on discharge returned to home PO dex 2mg BID. 
Continued home fioricet 

# Rash
Patient with concern for truncal rash in a dermatomal 
distribution. Patient notes that pain preceded the onset of rash 
and pruritus. However, no vesicles anywhere on exam; merely 
scattered papules. Started acyclovir on admission due to unclear 
picture, will continue valacyclovir on discharge despite low 
concern for zoster. 

# Right Facial Swelling
R facial swelling which has improved. Noted in clinic on ___ 
and started on Clindamycin for empiric dental infection. 
However, had "many pills" left on ___ despite course planned to 
end ___, suspicious for having missed multiple medications. No 
abscess, localized tenderness to palpation. CT Mandible with no 
focal fluid collection or other infectious findings.

# Frequent UTI
# Interstitial Cystitis
Patient with h/o frequent UTIs on nitrofurantoin ppx. New 
dysuria inpatient.
Continued home nitrofurantoin and phenazopyridine prn.

# Thoracic Fracture
# Back Pain
Patient recently suffered a T9 compression fracture during a 
tonic clonic seizure, without signs or symptoms of cord 
compression. Current back pain may be the result of both 
compression fracture +/- zoster. Patient requiring narcotics for 
pain control initially while inpatient; now significantly 
improved. Will discharge with 20 tabs of tramadol.

# Seizures
Per review of last discharge summary, patient developed seizures 
in the setting of her diagnosis of astrocytoma. She was treated 
with Keppra and cvEEG did not demonstrate any epileptic 
activity; however, given the deep neuro-anatomical location of 
her lesion, it was deemed unlikely to show up on EEG. Her 
seizures were preceded by aura of smelling burning rubber. On 
last admission her keppra was increased to 2000mg BID in 
consultation with neurology, with improvement in symptoms. 

# Astrocytoma
Recently diagnosed on biopsy. Treatment with radiation, 
tezolomide and avastin (initiated ___. Per attending 
neurooncologist, temporary hold of tezolomide and radiation will 
not impact overall prognosis. Hold temozolomide and radiation 
for now, will restart ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#ERROR!
# ANXIETY
The patient has had worsening anxiety since her diagnosis. She 
was previously prescribed Ativan which she was taking multiple

prior to admission who adjusted her medication regimen, which we 
will follow as below. 
- Continued clonazepam PRN for anxiety
- Continued zyprexa QHS
- Continued escitalopram

# RESTLESS LEGS
- Continued home amitriptyline and pramipexole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital with headache, nausea, and fever.

The headache may have been from tapering off your steroids 
(dexamethasone). We restarted the steroids at a higher dose and 
your headaches improved.

You also had fevers, which you've had for a while with no clear 
source. We did a CT scan of your mandible to look for a dental 
infection but didn't find one.

You also had a rash which may be shingles, and we started an 
antiviral medication.

It was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish 
you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Health Team
