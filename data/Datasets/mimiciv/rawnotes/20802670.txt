PA and lateral CXR ___:
The tip of a right internal jugular central venous catheter 
projects over the 
mid SVC.  The chest tubes and mediastinal drain have been 
removed.  There are 
bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  No 
pneumothorax or pleural 
effusion is visualized.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is 
enlarged but 
unchanged.

Notification: The surgeon/

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on ___ and was taken to the operating 
room. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 and 
mitral valve repair. Please see operative note for full details. 
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU 
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
 
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1. He was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor 
support. Beta blocker was initiated and he was diuresed toward 
his preoperative weight. He remained hemodynamically stable and 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. He 
required frequent pulmonary hygiene and was weaned to room air 
with using his home inhalers. The patient developed rate 
controlled atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone and 
Eliquis. He will follow up with this cardiologist for further AF 
management. He developed a mild ___ (peak creatinine 1.4) and 
metformin can be restarted as an outpatient. He has a history of 
chronic compensated systolic heart failure and he was started on 
Coreg and his home Losartan.  He was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility and 
deemed appropriate for discharge home . By the time of discharge 
on POD 4 he was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, and 
pain was controlled with oral analgesics. He was discharged to 
home on ___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
