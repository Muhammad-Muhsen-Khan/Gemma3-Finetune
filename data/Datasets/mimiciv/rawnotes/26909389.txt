History of Present Illness:
Patient is an ___ gentleman with a ___ CAD c/b MI in 
___ and ___ s/p CABG in ___ and DES in ___, on plavix, and 
Afib on Coumadin, is transferred from ___ for management of 
acute MI. Patient woke up this morning at 03:45 and felt 
pressure and pain in his chest. He took PRN nitroglycerin x3 
with relief. He then awoke one hour later with increased chest 
pressure and pain so had his daughter take him to the ___ 
___. At the OSH ___ he was found to have a trop-I of 0.___hanges in his lateral EKG. He was initiated on a 
nitro and heparin drip and transferred to ___ for evaluation 
for catheterization. 

Patient reports that his chest pressure has significantly 
improved on the nitro drip. He denies shortness of breath, 
lightheadedness, dizziness, or palpitations. Of note, patient

pain free until ___ when he developed a second MI and a stent 
was placed. Since his stent placement in ___ patient sometimes

IMAGING:
-TTE (___):
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly 
depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with septal/apical septal hypokinesis 
suggested. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion
-Cardiac catheterization (___):
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
* Left Main Coronary Artery
The LMCA is free of significant disease.
* Left Anterior Descending
The LAD is occluded after D1.
The ___ Diagonal is free of significant disease.
* Circumflex
The Circumflex has origin 50-60% stenosis and mid diffuse 70%.
* Right Coronary Artery
The RCA is a large vessel with diffuse proximal 50% stenosis and 
distal focal 70% stenosis.

as previously reported atretic LIMA.
Recommendations
1. Heart team discussion for strategy for AVR and possible 
revascularization. Unable to consider PCI
today due to uncertain target and increasing patient agitation 
demanding procedure be terminated.
-CXR (___):
IMPRESSION: No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is 
enlarged in this patient with intact midline sternal wires and 
clips indicating previous CABG procedure.  There is moderate 
pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive 
atelectasis at the bases. 
-CXR (___):
IMPRESSION: In comparison with study of ___, this and 
placement of right subclavian PICC line that extends to the 
lower SVC. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with 
pulmonary edema and 
worsening bilateral pleural effusions with compressive 
atelectasis at the 
bases.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ M PMHx CAD c/b MI s/p CABG (___) and PCI (___), pAF on 
Coumadin with h/o TIA, AAA s/p stenting (___), PAD c/b 
carotid/SMA/iliac/renal artery disease, moderate-severe AS who 
presented on ___ with chest pain and dyspnea found to have 
NSTEMI with hospital course complicated by cardiogenic shock ___ 
severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and 
hypoxic respiratory failure. Following acute decompensation, the 
patient and his family opted to forgo invasive intervention and 
he expired on ___ in the cardiac intensive care unit. 

Summary of hospital course:
#ERROR!

Mr. ___ presented to ___ as a transfer from OSH on 
___ in the setting of chest pain with exertion and at rest 
found to elevated troponins and dynamic ECGs changes consistent 
with NSTEMI. He was transferred to ___ for further 
intervention. He was started on ACS treatment, including 
aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, and metoprolol. In the setting of 
ongoing chest pain, he was started on a nitro gtt. He was taken 
emergently for cath; however in the setting of elevated INR and 
complex peripheral vascular disease the procedure was deferred 
and he was transferred to the CCU for ongoing management. He 
continued to have chest pain with uptrending cardiac enzymes and 
dynamic ECG changes, prompting uptitration of nitro gtt. A TTE 
was obtained which showed severe aortic stenosis. He was taken 
for catheterization on ___, notable for diffuse disease not 
amenable to intervention. His hospital course was complicated by 
atrial fibrillation with RVR and he was started on an uptitrated 
dose of metoprolol; however following his tachycardia he 
developed progressive shortness of breath, hypoxia, and 
uptrending lactate. Concern for decompensation of aortic 
stenosis in setting of worsening ischemia. He received diuresis 
and afterload reduction, however he continued to decompensate 
with worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, chest pain, 
hypotension, and altered mental status. He was placed on BiPAP 
without improvement in his respiratory status and pressor 
therapy was started. In the setting of need for immediate 
aggressive intervention, the patient's family opted to 
transition his care to DNR/DNI. He expired soon after on ___.
