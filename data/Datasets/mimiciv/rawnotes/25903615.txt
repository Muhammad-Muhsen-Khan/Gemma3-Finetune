Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ man with history of 
coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, microcytic anemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
with a recent admission following a fall and syncopal event with 
head strike, found to have right temporal lobe contusion with 
subdural hematoma and component of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 
who presented from rehab with agitation and confusion of acute 
onset, due to TBI related dementia with behavioral disturbances, 
improved with medication management.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#Agitation, in the setting of IPH and SDH
In brief, broad workup was negative and presentation was felt to 
be due to medication effect + dementia with behavioral 
disturbances with improvement with changes in medication 
management with recommendations from neurology and geriatrics. 
See below for details:

Patient presented from rehab with new onset agitation concerning 
for derlirium. Recent traumatic IPH and SDH requiring admission 
___ found to be likely due to orthostatic syncopal episode. 
Broad workup for potential infection and metabolic derangements 
was unremarkable. Concern for meningitis initially in ED but 
patient with no fevers, leukocytosis, or evidence of meningeal 
irritation. Per report, the patient had a recent fall at rehab 
on ___ without overt change in mentation. Repeat repeat CT 
head however did show evidence of increased dilatation of 
ventricles raising concern for possible hydrocephalus. No 
evidence of seizure activity based on reports. The patient was 
evaluated by neurosurgery, neurology. Teams agreed that the mild 
dilatation of the ventricles as seen on the CT head would be 
unlikely to contribute to his current symptoms. The patient is 
much more calm and communicable 2 days after admission and 
overtly refused a lumbar puncture even after discussion with his 
daughter who is his healthcare proxy.  Based on patient 
preference, and decision was made to forego a lumbar puncture at 
this time. Neurology felt that the patient's levetiracetam 1000 
mg twice daily may perhaps be contributing to his agitation and 
hence the dose was reduced to 500 mg twice daily initially and 
then was completely stopped after further discussions with 
neurosurgery and neurology. 

After workup, patient was stabilized on a regimen including 
olanzapine, trazodone, Depakote and ramelteon with goal to 
eventually be on monotherapy with depakote. He was often 
reoriented and was placed on delirium precautions.  A speech and 
swallow evaluation showed that the patient was at risk for 
aspiration and was placed on a modified dysphagia diet of ground 
solids and thin liquids.  His citalopram 10 mg was discontinued 
given concern for possible hallucinations prior to presentation. 
 Also, based on collateral information from his daughter (___ 
___ proxy), the patient was previously not on any SSRI. 

RECOMMENDED ONGOING MEDICATION MANAGEMENT:
Taper for olanzapine, trazadone and ramelteon: 
1. Reduce olanzapine to 10 mg 2 weeks after discharge to rehab 
(___), then reduce by 5 mg each week (___) while 
monitoring behavioral changes and having low threshold to stop 
taper 
2. 1 week after olanzapine is discontinued, taper trazadone 
starting at 25 mg (___) then halving to 12.5 mg a week later 
(___) then stopping a week later IF patient continues to sleep 
well and have stable behaviors. 
3. 1 week after trazadone is discontinued (___), reduce 
ramelteon to 4 mg then stopping one week later (___) IF patient 
continues to sleep well and have stable behaviors. 

[] Labwork: check depakote level, CMP, ammonia level, CBC weekly 
for monitoring, particularly with close monitoring of 
creatinine. Please make sure Depakote level is not 
supratherapeutic. Please monitor ammonia level to ensure not 
rising from Depakote toxicity. 

#Fall
#New ___
Patient fell while walking to commode evening of ___. Head 
strike and brief loss of consciousness. Stat Head CT showed new 
extra-axial density along right parietal lobe. Left and right 
temporal lobe encephalomalacia noted in regions of prior 
contusions/IPH.  No acute fractures on xray.  His condition was 
monitored and he was able to walk without further fall events or 
injuries.  Mental status was stable. Patient had a repeat CT 
head on ___ which showed a decrease in size of his SDH. Patient 
should follow up with neurosurgery and neurology.  

#Fever
Initially presented with fevers.  Likely viral in etiology given 
that they subsided within 24 hours after admission. 

___ on CKD
Baseline creatinine ___.  Patient developed ___ after 
reinitiation of lisinopril and metformin in the setting of 
decreased po intake.  His condition improved with IVF. Stopped 
lisinopril and held metformin. Discharge Cr 1.3. 

#HYPERKALEMIA
course c/b hyperkalemia in the setting of reinitiating 
lisinopril and ___, up to peak of 5.3 on whole blood potassium.  
EKG unchanged. Lisinopril was discontinued and he was treated 
with IVF and low potassium diet with improvement. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#HFpEF
New diagnosis at last admission and required IV diuresis at that 
time.  No signs of volume overload on exam without JVD, ___ 
edema, or diffuse crackles other than at the bases.  No 
orthopnea noted.  His volume status was monitored closely and 
his weights were trended daily.  IV diuresis would have been 
considered if he appeared to be volume overloaded however this 
was not the case during his hospital stay.

#HTN
The patient was found to be hypertensive in the 150s likely 
secondary to agitation and was not receiving his home 
antihypertensives (amlodipine 5 mg and lisinopril 40 mg).  
Initially, as the patient's renal function appeared to be at 
baseline he was continued on his home doses of 
antihypertensives.  However, a mild increase in his creatinine 
was noted and hence, his lisinopril was discontinued.  His blood 
pressure was closely monitored with a goal of keeping it below 
160 systolic given recent intraparenchymal hemorrhage and 
subdural hematoma. Amlodipine was increased to 10 mg daily. 
Lisinopril was stopped due to ___, hyperkalemia.  

#Microcytic Anemia
The patient was noted to have microcytic anemia during his prior 
hospitalization with a baseline around 11.  On this admission, 
the patient was noted to be at his baseline hemoglobin.  He was 
also noted to have early ___ and B12 deficiency at last 
hospitalization for his iron studies and B12 levels were 
rechecked but were found to mostly be within normal limits.

#Transaminitis
Mild Transaminitis on labs, held atorvastatin initially and 
improved. Restarted statin prior to discharge. 

#T2DM, insulin dependent
The patient's glargine increased to 20 U QBreakfast, placed on 
standing Humalog ___ with breakfast, lunch, dinner in addition 
to Humalog sliding scale and was continued on pioglitazone 45 
mg. His metformin and linagliptin were held while inpatient. 

#Hyperlipidemia
The patient was continued on atorvastatin 40 mg daily

#CAD
The patient was continued on aspirin 81 mg

#CKD
His creatinine was trended daily and his ACE inhibitor was 
stopped in the setting of an increase in his serum creatinine

#Psoriasis
The patient was continued on his home dose of clobetasol 
proprionate topical ointment

#OA/Chronic pain
Home gabapentin 300 mg twice daily was held in the setting of 
elevated serum creatinine and possibly contributing to delirium.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
-You came to the hospital from rehab because you were very 
confused and agitated concerning for delirium.

What happened while I was admitted to the hospital?
-Your symptoms of confusion and agitation were worked up for 
various possible causes such as infection, abnormal blood 
numbers etc. but no obvious cause was found
-A scan of your head showed that there was a mild increase in 
the size of fluid-filled spaces in your brain however both 
neurosurgery and neurology services thought that your current 
symptoms were unlikely to be caused by this and felt your 
symptoms were because of the head injury you had recently 
sustained. 
-Chest x-ray did not show any signs of pneumonia or lung 
infection
-It was thought that your acute confusion may have partially 
been caused by your antiseizure medication that was started to 
prevent seizures after your recent head injury, so the 
medication was stopped after discussing with the neurosurgeons
_x0096_Your swallowing was also checked and was found to have 
improved, your diet was changed accordingly.
-Your lab numbers were closely monitored and you were continued 
on your home medications

What should I do after I leave the hospital?
-Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed, 
details below
-Keep all of your appointments as scheduled 
-You are scheduled to have appointments with neurosurgery and 
neurology
-We also recommend that you establish care with a primary care 
physician who can follow you closely

We wish you the very best!
