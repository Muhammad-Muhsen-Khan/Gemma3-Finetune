#ERROR!
This is a ___ with history of alcohol abuse, depression, anxiety 
who presented with bilateral lower extremity edema, elevated 
LFTs, jaundice concerning for acute alcoholic hepatitis in 
setting of cirrhosis.

Active Issues:
#ERROR!
# Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis in setting of cirrhosis:  
Patient has a history of EtOH abuse, recent increase in EtOH 
intake with evidence of possible cirrhosis on ultrasound (Child 
___ class C, c/b Grade I esophageal varices) and elevated 
LFTs/bilirubin. Steroids were started for high discriminant 
function, but they were eventually stopped due to lack of 
response. Pt had EGD done showing grade 1 varices and portal 
hypertensive gastropathy. The patient was eventually treated 
with supportive therapy including IV albumin, and tube feeding.

#Etoh Abuse:  
Patient has a history of ETOH abuse, last drink was 3 hours 
prior to presentation. Pt presented w/increased tremors, 
diarrhea, and agitation though this diminished rapidly, only 
required 1x dose 5mg diazepam while withdrawing, DC'd CIWA on 
___. Pt continued on thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin. Pt 
was seen by SW, unable to go to daughter's house, was discharged 
to rehab.

#Hyponatremia:  
Na was 123 on presentation with evidence of bilateral lower 
extremity swelling which improved after albumin, nutrition. This 
was suspected to be secondary to intravascular volume depletion 
and extravascular overload, most likely due to cirrhosis. Urine 
lytes were most consistent with decreased effective arterial 
blood volume. Hyponatremia improved w/albumin, diuretics, and 
improved nutrition. 

# BRBPR: 
Observed to have frank blood in stool. Unclear etiology but pt 
w/o screening colonoscopy and ___ yo though bleeding pattern is 
most suggestive of hemorrhoids. Pt had a colonoscopy which 
showed internal hemorrhoids that were not actively bleeding and 
diverticula, although there was large amounts of stool found in 
the colon,  and therefore pt will require repeat colonoscopy for 
colon cancer screening as an outpatient. 
 
#Homelessness: 
Pt will be DC'd to ___ with hopes that will be able to have more 
stable living situation after DC from ___. Pt unable to go to 
daughter's home, though she is involved in his care and his HCP.
 
#Depression: 
Took increased EtOH recently ___ to feelings of inc depression. 
Not feeling suicidal, denies SI. Pt with better mood after 
speaking with his daughter on ___. Is not currently taking any 
medications before or during admission.

Transitional issues:
#ERROR!
-Pt will require Hepatitis B Vaccine, not vaccinated per 
serology
-Pt is off all of diuretics due to hyponatremia, so this should 
be re-evaluated as an outpatient.
- Pt off of Nadolol but may require it as an outpatient 
eventually.
-Pt will be DC'd with tube feeds which are necessary ___ to poor 
nutrition
-Pt will need repeat colonoscopy as outpatient for colon cancer 
screening, as pt's bowel prep for this colonoscopy was 
insufficient for this purpose
-Pt will need to be on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily for SBP 
prophylaxis indefinitely
-Pt also started on ursodiol, lactulose, thiamine, folic acid, 
and multivitamin due to his cirrhosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted to ___ for your jaundice and puffy legs 
after you drank a lot of alcohol for a number of days. Your 
liver was found to be very damaged and we started you on 
steroids to help your liver, but eventually stopped these. We 
were also able to place a feeding tube so that we could give you 
adequate nutrition to help repair your liver. We also treated 
you for an infection in your abdomen. You had an endoscopy which 
showed no severe bleeding. You had some signs of a little 
bleeding in your stool, so you got a colonoscopy to find out the 
source of your bleeding, which was most likely due to internal 
hemorrhoids. However, you will eventually need another 
colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer, as there was too much 
stool in your bowels to properly evaluate for colon cancer.

We hope you get better at the facility you are going to and we 
hope you are able to avoid alcohol completely in the future.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Your ___ Liver Team
