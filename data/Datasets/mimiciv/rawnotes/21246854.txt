History of Present Illness:
EU Critical ___ is a ___ woman with a
history of hyperlipidemia not on anticoagulation presents with
acute onset left-sided weakness since this evening. 

History is obtained from her sister ___ at the bedside.  She
was otherwise reported to be in her usual state of health this
morning into the afternoon.  In fact, they were downtown and had
taken a train back home.  The last time that she was seen normal
was around 6:00 ___.  The sister found her at home with
dysarthria, and left-sided facial droop and weakness.  She
reportedly denied a headache at this time.  She called EMS and
the patient was transferred to ___ for further evaluation.  BP
on initial evaluation was elevated to 170/98.  This resolved
without intervention.

Of note, she denies any history of cognitive decline she can
think of.

unable to sustain antigravity effort for more than 1 second. 
Later on on subsequent examination, she was able to lift her 
left
arm against gravity for up to 3 seconds.  She was able to lift
her left leg also against gravity for up to 3 seconds.  She
grimaces to noxious in all 4 extremities.  On double 
simultaneous

LLE - moves spontaneously in the plane of the bed, able to bend
knee and sustain on bed. 
RLE - moves lower extremity antigravity with effort

Sensory: previously: correctly identifies light touch on both
left in right. In lower extremities extinguishes on the right,
and in the upper extremities extinguishes on the left to
bilateral. 

-DTRs: Left toes mute, right toes down. 

 
Pertinent Results:
___ 2:21 AM CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
No significant interval change in right frontal intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with subarachnoid extension and 4 mm leftward midline 
shift. 

___ 4:53 ___ MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST 
Again noted is a large right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma 
with hematocrit levels measuring 41 x 51 mm in the axial plane 
and appears fairly similar to minimally increased in size 
compared to prior CT imaging (this may be secondary to 
difference in technique).  Mild amount of associated 
subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the right cerebral convexity.  
There is no definite active extravasation of contrast or 
enhancing underlying mass lesion as described above. 
Surrounding vasogenic edema with mass effect, partial effacement 
of the right lateral ventricle and midline shift to the left by 
2 mm.  No hydrocephalus. 
  
Moderate white matter microangiopathic change.  Chronic lacunar 
infarct in the left basal ganglia and possibly left frontal lobe 
as described above. 

___ 9:50 ___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
Expected evolution of a large right frontal intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with no interval change in size, with unchanged edema 
and associated mass effect. Unchanged adjacent subarachnoid 
component.  No new hemorrhage. 
  

DISCHARGE LABS: 
#ERROR!
___ 04:30AM BLOOD WBC-10.7* RBC-4.07 Hgb-12.3 Hct-38.9 
MCV-96 MCH-30.2 MCHC-31.6* RDW-14.8 RDWSD-51.7* Plt ___

K-3.8 Cl-108 HCO3-25 AnGap-___ woman with history notable for DMII and HLD admitted 
with acute-onset left-sided weakness, found to have large right 
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage complicated by cerebral 
edema.

#ICU Course
Following admission to the Neurosciences ICU, Ms. ___ was 
noted to have worsening left-sided weakness, prompting 
administration of 3% saline overnight; follow-up MRI did not 
demonstrate worsening hemorrhage, prompting discontinuation of 
hyperosmolar therapy. No evidence of underlying mass or 
microhemorrhages suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy were 
noted on this imaging, without evidence of underlying vascular 
abnormalities on CTA, suggesting hypertension as the underlying 
mechanism of her IPH. Ms. ___ subsequent ICU course was 
complicated by an episode of lethargy and vomiting, again 
prompting administration of 3% saline over a 24-hour period, 
though she subsequently developed a fever (without clear source 
of infection on blood and urine cultures or CXR) that may have 
accounted for her lethargy. Both symptoms subsequently resolved 
without further intervention.

#Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage c/b cerebral edema
Etiology of bleed was thought to be hypertension, as her MRI 
showed no microhemorrhages that would raise suspicion for 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Her home aspirin was held due to 
her acute brain bleed. We discussed that restarting aspirin 
should be considered in ___ months if her risk of ischemic 
stroke is thought to outweigh her risk of hemorrhage; this is to 
be determined at follow up with neurology. She had an MRI which 
showed no underlying mass lesion and no microbleeds. She will 
need an MRI brain with and without contrast in 12 weeks (Around 
___. 

# Hypertension
Her blood pressures were controlled to SBP < 150. We increased 
captopril to 50mg Q8H, and labetalol 200mg PO Q8H. These 
medications were titrated up regularly, and were therefore not 
transitioned to long acting while inpatient. These medications 
should be transitioned to long acting formulations at rehab.  

# HLD
We did not give a statin for the first week after her bleed due 
to some evidence that statins may worsen bleeds in the acute 
phase. We started atorvatstatin 40mg daily on ___. 

GI/Abdomen:  
Patient experienced some nausea and vomiting in the ICU which 
was thought to be due to constipation. After starting a bowel 
regimen of Senna, Docusate, Bisacodyl, Miralax patient had no 
more constipation. 

#Nutrition
Patient was seen by speech and swallow, who thought patient was 
not safe to swallow as she was dysarthric and not initiating a 
swallow appropriately. Patient agreed to PEG tube, which was 
also discussed with her HCP and niece, all who agreed to move 
forward with PEG tube so that patient could receive the 
nutrition she requires. Her PEG tube was placed on ___ and tube 
feeds resumed ___ hours later. She was given Jevity 1.2 goal 
55 cc/hr, FWF 200 Q6H.

GU/Renal: 
Patient received hypertonic saline in the neuro ICU for concern 
for cerebral edema. This made her hypernatremic, which was 
monitored while she was in the step down unit. Our goal was to 
slowly decrease her sodium levels, so we increased the free 
water flushes in her tube feeds and gave her very small boluses 
of normal saline. Over 3 days, her sodium trended down to 
normal. 
 
Endocrine:  
Hemoglobin A1c 6.3, and patient was maintained on sliding scale 
insulin. There was also concern for hypothyroidism as TSH was 
4.6. As patient was acutely ill, the decision was made to have 
PCP recheck this level as an outpatient.
 
Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis was initially provided with 
pneumoboots in the setting of ICH. After 24 hours, SQH was 
started in addition to pneumoboots.

prescribed medications, need for followup) given (verbally or 
written)? (x) Yes - () No  
5. Assessment for rehabilitation and/or rehab services 
considered? (x) Yes - () No. If no, why not? (I.e. patient at

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

___ came to the hospital because ___ had weakness of the left 
side of your body and slurred speech. ___ were found to have 
bleeding in your brain, called an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC INFARCT, 
which was the cause of your weakness. Stroke can have many 
different causes, so we assessed ___ for medical conditions that 
might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent 
future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk 
factors are:  high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and 
diabetes. Your blood pressure was your biggest problem, so we 
started several blood pressure medications. 

We are changing your medications as follows:  
 
- Avoid blood thinners, anticoagulants, antiplatelets. 
  
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
___  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Your ___ Neurology Team
