CTA 
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality.
2.  New peribronchovascular ground-glass and nodular opacities, 
which most
likely represent an infectious or inflammatory process and may 
be related to
aspiration.
3.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Trace bilateral pleural 
effusions.
4.  Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which may be related to 
heart failure.

ECHO
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect or right-to-left shunt on color Doppler 
or agitated saline at rest. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is >15mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with 
a normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is severely depressed. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 28 % (normal 54-73%). There is no resting 
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal 
ascending aorta diameter for gender. There is a normal 
descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is an 
eccentric jet of mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. Due to the 
Coanda effect, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be 
UNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial 
effusion.
Compared with the prior TTE ___ , biventricular function 
has decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- DC weight of 114.2lb; please insure no active change in dry 
weight on follow up
- pt has been losing dry weight as well over past several 
months, with a reported lower interest in food (see below); I 
wonder whether there is some issue with difficulty cooking for 
herself contributing; may be worth investigating resources on 
outpatient side

___ w/ HFpEF, PAD (s/p iliac stents ___, renal artery stenosis, 
and axillary-bifemoral bypass ___ on apixaban), recurrent 
epistaxis, recent UGIB due to gastric AVMs s/p argon 
photocoagulation who is admitted from home with dyspnea treated 
with 5 days of levaquin but with continued hypoxia ___ CHF, also 
found to have Hgb 6.6 transfused with 2 units of pRBCs. 

#) Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
#) Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
#) Acute systolic heart failure
#) Community acquired pneumonia 
Patient initially admitted with nonspecific symptoms but mainly 
subjective dyspnea. 
On ___, plan was for discharge home but patient triggered for 
hypoxia to ___ and tachypnea to ___. She required 5L NC when I 
assumed her care. At home she does not use oxygen. Initially her 
lungs had crackles and JVP was upto jaw. Of note, she did not 
have peripheral edema. She is supposed to be on bumex 2 PO 
daily. Patient told me she had no idea she was on a diuretic and 
did not have this medication on a printed home medication list 
she showed me. We started her on lasix 40 IV daily with 
improvement over the course of several days back to 1L NC. She 
intermittently was on RA, but would then require 1L NC during 
the night. She was transitioned to torsemide 40 PO daily on ___. 
Even when on RA, she had subjective dyspnea. This improved with 
incentive spirometry and chest ___, as well as guifenesin. CTA 
was done that showed some mucus plugging and ? e/o aspiration. 
SLP felt she was swallowing well on bedside eval and no video 
was necessary. She was seen by the pulmonary service who 
recommended treatment for emphysema with bronchodilators and 
LAMA. BNP then obtained that was over 4K, and ECHo shows newly 
depressed EF, demonstrating her symptoms are from decompensated 
heart failure. Diuresed with IV Lasix 120 BID as effective dose 
and breathing improved. Off O2 for 48h before DC and able to 
ambulate without difficulty. DC weight of 114.2lb. Will have ___ 
see her and set up cards, PCP ___.

#) Acute blood loss anemia
#) PAD s/p stents, bypass on apixaban
#) Gastric AVMs s/p APC 
Patient did not have any active signs of bleeding but had Hgb 
6.6 for which she received 2 units of pRBCS on admission. This 
may have also precipitated worsened edema for her. Her Hgb 
remained stable after the tranfusions. 
She has a history of epistaxis, but none while here. 
She also had recent EGD and ___ in ___ and had APC done to 
gastric AVMs. She also had a CT A/P in ___ which did not 
show any acute changes. 
She is elderly, has some component of CKD and is on apixaban for 
severe PAD s/p stents ad bypass, making her high risk for 
bleeding. 
She had an iron deficit of approximately 700 mg, had received 
two ___ transfusions, so she was scheduled for 3 infusions of 
ferrous gluconate 125 mg to make up for iron deficit.

#weight loss: Pt describes dry weight loss and a lack of 
interest in food. She denies dysphagia, odynophagia, choking, 
early satiety, night sweats. Pt lives alone and cooks for 
herself. She says she 'doesn't know what to cook'. Denies 
depressed mood. I suspect a component of having difficulty 
preparing food for herself or obtaining, as she was seen in 
house to eat well and enjoy meals. DC weight of 114.2. ___ 
benefit from nutrition or SW as outpatient

Greater than ___ hour spent on care on day of discharge.
