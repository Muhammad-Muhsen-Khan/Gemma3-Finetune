Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with orthostasis and
recurrent syncope, severe reflux, constipation, asthma, anxiety,
depression who presents with syncope referred from her 
outpatient
neurologist Dr. ___.

Per patient, she has had about weekly to every 10 days episodes
of syncope for the last ___ years (longest went 8 weeks between
episodes). The vast majority (about 90%) of episodes are with
postural changes, going from lying to sitting or sitting to
standing. About ___ episodes have been going from lying to
sitting, remainder with standing. Has had about 10% of episodes
when already standing and walking; has had a few while 
exercising
(on the treadmill). No prodrome; happens suddenly without 
warning
(no palpitations, feeling hot, sweats, nausea, greying out, 
etc).
Often will fall and hit her head with episodes; has had facial
bruising a number of times and multiple concussions. She does 
not
have any associated shaking movements, no incontinence, and eyes
are closed during the episodes. Mother who has witnessed the
episodes did not note any particular flushing, pallor, etc.
Typically has LOC for several seconds when witnessed. Once was
found down by her mother, unknown how long she had been out, and
today had a somewhat more prolonged episode in the setting of 
two
back to back episodes with others sitting her up in between. She
is typically immediately back to baseline, though she has been
confused if someone sits her up immediately after. 

She has had significant prior workup (uploaded in OMR under
Outside Records), predominantly in RI, including MRA neck
(unremarkable) and both routine and prolonged EEGs (both
unremarkable; captured event in ___ with postural change showed
tachycardia - from ___ to 120s - and some alpha rhythm but no
seizures). She was previously on Keppra and topiramate at 
various
times, though now is off both. The cardiac portion of her prior
workup is nicely summarized in a recent Cardiology
(electrophysiology)clinic note ___: "Transtelephonic
monitoring (___) captured multiple episodes of syncope
and palpitations, all correlating sinus rhythm/sinus
tachycardia/occasional PACs. Tilt table testing on ___ going
from 0deg to 70deg showed HR rise from 64 to 111bpm and BP drop
from 117/73 to 97/53 - this resulted in a 1 minute-long syncope.
She was given a diagnosis of POTS.

She has been managed with multiple medications including 
atenolol
(decreasing doses ___ bradycardia, discontinued by cardiology in
___, fludrocortisone, midodrine and pyridostigmine with no
significant improvement. She has a high salt diet, significant
fluid intake, uses over the counter compression stockings, and
tries to take her time with postural transitions. She exercises
regularly (treadmill and recumbent bike). 

In terms of other autonomic symptoms, she has significant reflux
requiring botox and baclofen. She reports dry mouth, some
flushing. Denies significant issues with hyper- or anhidrosis.
Endorses constipation which she reports started after starting
iron supplementation. Has had issues with urinary incontinence
requiring bladder mesh. Denies dry eyes/sicca. Has had
intentional 60 lbs weight loss over the last year or so. Per Dr.
___, denies difficulty transitioning to dim or
bright lights, though on my history endorses some vague blurry
vision/decreased acuity over the last few months; denies early
satiety. Does get hives, multiple medication allergies, and has
marked reactions to medical tape/leads, but previously denied
frank dermographism. 

She has had migraines for many years and recent triggers include
syncopal episodes. She often has some headache if she hits her
head but then will thereafter develop a migraine (typical
migraines are with visual aura of blurry spots, bifrontal,
throbbing, with photo- and phonophobia, nausea, and occasional
vomiting). 

She saw Dr. ___ first in ___ for a second opinion. Dr.
___ that given bradycardia, POTS was unlikely. She
had a question of dysautonomia but felt evaluating this would be
difficult given patient's polypharmacy/extensive medication
regimen. Patient was noted to have decreased sensation to
pinprick in the lower extremities. Dr. ___ labs to
evaluate for possible cause for small fiber neuropathy (B12, 
A1c,
SPEP, HIV, TTG, MMA, ACE, Heavy metal screen, ESR, Sjogren's 
Ab);
workup thus far has been unrevealing. Please see Dr.
___ from ___ ___s OMR for details of 
this
workup.  

Today was in clinic waiting room waiting to be seen. Got up to 
go
to the bathroom when she had syncope. Was on the ground, quickly
regained consciousness. Multiple staff around who sat her up,
patient again lost consciousness, was out for possibly more than
a minute (? a few minutes) and thereafter a bit out of it for
about 10 or 20 minutes. Per mother who was there, was unable to
see patient to see if pale or any other details given so many
staff around. 

Sending chem, getting CT/CTA. Given Zofran, Tylenol, NS,
Albuterol in ED. 

On neuro ROS, the pt endorses headache today (right sided where
possibly hit head, no migraine today). Endorses decreased vision
over several months. Denies diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia,
lightheadedness or presyncope preceding syncopal events; denies
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

IMPRESSION:

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is a normal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study. The 
prominent beta activity is likely a medication effect. No focal 
abnormalities 
or epileptiform discharges were present. There were no 
electrographic 
seizures. 
  
TTE ___
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is no left 
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: No specific evidence of a structural cardiac 
abnormality identified on available images to explain patient's 
syncope.  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of recurrent syncopal 
episodes complicated by head strikes without clear etiology 
despite extensive workup in the past, thus far overall 
unremarkable, with the exception of a positive tilt table test
about ___ years ago. She presented to ___ after a prolonged 
syncopal episode in clinic. In the ___ ED she underwent CT/CTA 
head which was unremarkable. 
While on the general neurology service she was hooked on cvEEG, 
which did not show any epileptiform discharges or seizures. In 
addition, she underwent an Echocardiogram which was WNL and 
multiple ECGs which showed intermittent sinus tachycardia, but 
have otherwise been unremarkable making cardiogenic etiology of 
syncope such as structural abnormalities, ACS, or arrhythmias 
unlikely. She had no further episodes of orthostatic hypotension 
during admission. Most likely etiology of her symptoms is 
thought to be PNS cause such as small fiber neuropathy 
considering absence of features consistent with CNS source of 
syncope, including lack of sensory deficits. In addition, she 
had no signs concerning for ___ plus disorders on exam. 
Her home Amitryptiline was discontinued and Midodrine was 
adjusted so her last dose is in the evening. 
She will get the rest of her work up, including an EMG/NCS and 
possible skin biopsy as an outpatient, since she asked to be 
discharged to attend her son's graduation. She was instructed to 
not drive given syncopal episodes.
She was discharged in stable condition with outpatient follow 
up.
