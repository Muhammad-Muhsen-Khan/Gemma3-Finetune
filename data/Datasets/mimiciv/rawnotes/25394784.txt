PATIENT SUMMARY STATEMENT
#ERROR!
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old ___ speaking female with 
history
of HFpEF (EF 58%), CAD, atrial fibrillation (on Xarelto), HTN,
and CVA while on warfarin (BI-N ___ who presented as a
transfer from the ___ for weight gain, edema, and fatigue
concerning for acute diastolic HF exacerbation. 

# CORONARIES: Unknown 
# PUMP: EF 58% (___)
# RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation 

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
#ERROR!
# Acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation 
Patient brought in by family due to concern for ~20 lb weight 
gain. Per patient's daughter, her legs, abdomen and face were 
very edematous. Dry weight was reported as 122.6 lbs and weight 
on admission at 154.32 lbs. Her volume exam was inconsistent 
with this weight gain as she did not appear floridly overloaded. 
She had no JVD, no crackles other than lower extremity edema. 
Her pro-BNP on admission was 1594. She diuresed very well with 
40mg Iv Lasix and was transitioned to Po torsemide at 30mg 
daily. 

Etiology of this exacerbation likely secondary to confusion 
regarding fluid restriction as family was reporting that they 
were encouring patient to drink at least 2L of fluids daily. Has 
otherwise been compliant with home diuretic dosing, though 
notably, may have inadequate absorption due to mild abdominal 
edema. There was no evidence of active infection, no chest 
pain/ECG changes to suggest ACS and Atrial fib with 
well-controlled rates. It was ultimately felt that patient may 
have a new dry weight as she appeared euvolemic on discharge. 
Her discharge weight was 139.33 lbs. She was discharged on 
torsemide 30mg QD, metoprolol 50mg XL BID, amlodipine 10mg daily 
and losartan 25mg daily.

# RLE rash
Patient had an erythematous patch on the RLE which improved
overnight and now with a 4cm nodular mass in the area. Initially
suspected cellulitis. However given improvement without 
antibiotics, no fever, leukocytosis and development of nodular 
lesion, suspected phlebitis. Lower extremity ultrasound was 
negative. Encouraged patient to apply warm compress to the area 
upon discharge.

# Hyponatremia
Patient presented with hyponatremia to 127. Etiology felt to be 
hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting of volume overload, as 
above. Her sodium improved with diuresis. She was also placed on 
a 2L fluid restriction.

# Coagulopathy
Elevated INR to 3.4 on arrival. Suspect nutritional component 
and
pt also on xarelto which can affect INR. No evidence of active
bleeding. INR was 2.4 on discharge. Patient sent home with ___ 
who will continue to check INR.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
#ERROR!
# Atrial fibrillation
CHADS2-VASc 9
Continued home metoprolol fractionated to 25mg Q6h and home 
rivaroxaban 20mg qpm. 

# Hypertension
Continued home amlodipine 10mg daily and losartan 25mg daily

# CVA
Admitted to BI-N in ___ with CVA while on warfarin.
Transitioned to rivaroxaban at this time and ASA 81mg daily
discontinued. 

# PAD
# CAD
Previously on ASA 81mg daily; discontinued upon initiation of
rivaroxaban in ___. Continued home atorvastatin 20mg qpm and 
metoprolol as above.

# Medullary thyroid carcinoma s/p thyroidectomy
# Post-surgical hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 112mcg daily.
