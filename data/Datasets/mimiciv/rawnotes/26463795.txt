3. Sequela of portal hypertension including splenomegaly and 
moderate ascites. 

___ CXR
No pulmonary edema or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, of indeterminate age, with 
subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe.

left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular 
disease seen.  

CT ABD/PEL ___
1. Cirrhotic liver with sequela of portal hypertension including 
splenomegaly, small varices and moderate to large volume 
ascites.
