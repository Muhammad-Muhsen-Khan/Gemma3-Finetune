noted to be: "alert and oriented on discharge, and able to give

her ___

In the ED, initial vitals: T98.2 | 163/57 | 76 | 16 | 99%RA
Labs were significant for  
 - negative UTox/STox
 - UA with no WBC/few bacteria/neg Leuks
 - Chem7 without notable derangements (BUN:Cr>20, Cr 1.1)
 - CBC without leukocytosis or left shift
 - anemia Hgb 9.9 / Hct 31.7
Imaging showed  
 - CXR with minor bibasilar atelectasis. No acute 
cardiopulmonary process
 - CT Head: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. A chronic 
left occipital lobe infarct and chronic small vessel ischemic 
changes are unchanged. 3. Mild age appropriate global atrophy. 
4. Evidence of chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis.
In the ED, she received  4L IVF and 0.125mg pramipexole
Vitals prior to transfer: T97.3 | 140/63 | 79 | 14 | 98%RA

Currently, pt says she cannot tell me if she has any pain. She 
is concerned that the doctors, nurses, and lawyers are 
conspiring. She mentions snakes. She tells me she is worried 
that "they are going to kill all of us." She denies the risk is 
personal to her but "all of us are going to be killed." She 
endorses hearing voices telling her this and also endorses 
seeing things that other people may not be able to see. 
 
ROS:  Unable to evaluate for ROS because patient answers most 
questions with "I know but I can't tell you."

treatment but chart records suggest history of visions (may have 
been thought to be cultural variant)

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  ___ with PMHx of atypical ___ 
disease, vascular dementia, Hx CVA, HTN, DM2, and hypothyroidism 
who presents from ___ with ___ week history of 
altered mental status, including visual/auditory hallucinations 
and delusions, worsened in last several days.
 
#AMS: Subacute derangement from baseline over ___ weeks with 
acute worsening in last 24 hrs prior to admission. Symptoms 
including prominent delusions and hallucinations have persisted 
during hospitalization. Symptom pattern consistent with both 
psychosis and delirium. Etiology unclear. She had extensive 
medical workup demonstrating no evidence of toxic ingestions or 
withdrawal (negative Serum Tox/Urine Tox), metabolic 
derangements (Chem7/Glucose/LFTs all within normal limits and 
TSH (5.6) & B12 (1291) with only mild elevations), infectious 
changes (no focal infectious symptoms, afebrile, chest x-ray 
without significant findings, urinalysis without significant 
findings) or intracranial vascular process (non-contrast head CT 
was negative). Most likely felt to be progression of underlying 
neurological process (including alternative diagnosis ___ 
Body dementia or atypical course of ___. Etiology was 
considered to be less likely primary psychiatric given age. 
Outpatient trazodone and pramipexole were discontinued given 
concern for contribution but there was no improvement. A trial 
of low-dose quetiapine was limited by patient refusal of 
medication; when doses were accepted, no clear improvement 
occurred. A trial of low-dose olanzipine was initiated but was 
also limited by patient refusal of medications; when doses were 
accepted, no clear improvement occurred. The patient remained 
acutely agitated and intermittently required medication for 
agitation (ativan 0.25mg or olanzapine 2.5mg IM). Soft 
mechanical restraints for safety were used once.

# ___ disease: Diagnosed prior to ___ residency and 
currently without records to support diagnosis. Per neurology 
review, pt was always without rest tremor or cogwheeling. 
Symptoms were primarily slowing and rigidity. As above, there is 
concern that patient may have alternative diagnosis ___ 
Body dementia vs atypical presentation. Neurology was consulted. 
Home sinamet was continued. Pramipexole was initially continued 
before being stopped due to concern for contribution to symptoms 
as above. 

#History CVA: In ___, Lt occipital parietal lesions. No 
residual deficits known. Home aspirin was ordered but generally 
refused.

#Hypothyroidism: Stable. TSH 5.6. Home levothyroxine 112mcg qhs 
ordered but generally refused.

# DM2: Stable. Home metformin was held. Fingerstick and insulin 
sliding scale was ordered, but patient was generally 
uncooperative. Blood sugars generally in 200s.

# Normocytic anemia: Stable. Unknown baseline. B12, TSH as 
above. No intervention was required.

# CODE STATUS: Presumed Full  
# CONTACT:  ___ ___
