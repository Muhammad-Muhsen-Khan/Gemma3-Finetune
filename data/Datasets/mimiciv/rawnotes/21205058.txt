Studies:

CT-C spine ___. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. 
2. Degenerative changes seen at C5 through C7 as detailed above 
with probable Schmorl's nodes at C5-C6. 

CT head w/o contrast ___
Probable chronic pontine infarct.  Few low-attenuation areas in 
the left 
centrum semiovale, stable, may represent subacute or chronic 
infarcts.  There are no new abnormalities. Moderate chronic 
small vessel ischemic changes. Generalized brain parenchymal 
atrophy. Nasal septal perforation. 

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of 
(1) amplitude asymmetry and attenuation of faster frequencies in 
the left 
temporal region, consistent with the patient's known left 
subdural hematoma, and (2) mild generalized background slowing, 
consistent with a mild encephalopathy, nonspecific with regards 
to etiology. There are no pushbutton activations, epileptiform 
discharges, or electrographic seizures. In comparison to the 
prior day's recording, there are no significant changes. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary:
==============
Mr ___ is an ___ with CAD s/p PCI (___), seizure 
disorder, and ___ disease who presented to OSH from home 
w/ AMS, fever and a CT head showing sub-acute 5mm SDH with no 
midline shift, transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation 
and management of possible infection. NSG recommended 
conservative management with outpatient follow up. Infectious 
work up was negative including LP; was on acyclovir but 
discontinued as CSF HSV PCR negative. Altered mental status 
likely multifactorial: poor substrate, hyponatremia, poor sleep, 
and right lower back/hip pain. Was initially confused oriented 
x0 but upon discharge was alert and oriented x3. Of note, 
patient had an episode of syncope, thought to be from 
orthostasis while sitting up straight for speech and swallow 
study. This episode resolved with lying the patient flat and 
IVF. He had no other episodes during his hospitalization. 

Transitional issues:
==================== 
[]New medications: carvedilol, acetaminophen, lidocaine patch
[]Stopped medications: metoprolol, pantoprazole
[]Dosing changes: none
[]Please ensure he has an appointment with neurosurgery in 4 
weeks after hospital discharge for follow up s/p SDH and 
traumatic brain injury
[]Please ensure he has an appointment with neurology ___ months 
after hospital discharge for continued management of seizure 
history and ___
[]Will need to restart aspirin on ___
[]Will need follow up on vitamin b12 levels; in house, B12 level 
at 302, borderline. 
[]CT revealed nasal septal perforation. Did not present with 
symptoms. Continue to monitor on outpatient basis
[]Given likely autonomic dysfunction secondary to ___, 
consider compression stockings to decrease future risk of 
orthostatic/vasovagal episodes
 
# CODE: DNR/DNI (documented at home, confirmed with wife, HCP)
# CONTACT: ___ (wife) ___, ___ (son) ___  


Acute issues:
=============
#Encephalopathy: infectious work up was pursued which was 
unremarkable including an lumbar puncture. Was initially placed 
on ceftriaxone and acyclovir but discontinued given low concern 
and negative test results. Likely multifactorial. At OSH, had 
sodium of 117 which resolved with IVF. Had poor sleep in 
addition to lower right back/right hip pain treated with 
ramelteon and Tylenol/lidocaine patches, respectively. On 
admission, was confused and oriented x0 but progressed to alert 
and oriented x3 upon discharge. There was concern for seizure 
activity but EEG was unremarkable. Patient seen by neurosurgery 
and neurology who recommended the patient stay on his home dose 
of keppra and to follow up as an outpatient.

#Sub-acute SDH: at OSH, CT head revealed subacute 5mm SDH with 
no midline shift. On interval CT head while at ___, no 
evidence of subdural hematoma. In setting of possible fall at 
home but unconfirmed.  
 
#Episode of unresponsiveness: occurred on ___, 3 minutes with 
eyes open but not responding to sternal rub. No evidence of 
seizure activity. No abnormalities seen on EKG and telemetry 
afterward. Had a large meal prior to episode in setting of a 
large meal, consistent with vasovagal. Also was noted to be 
orthostatic as well, likely contributing. No evidence of 
infection, arrhythmia, electrolyte abnormalities. Placed 
compression stockings for conservative management. 

#History of seizure disorder: on stable dose of Keppra per wife 
without seizures. EEG unremarkable during hospitalization. 
Continued home regimen of keppra.

#HTN: at home, on amlodipine, imdur, and lisinopril. Was 
transitioned onto carvedilol in house from metoprolol. 
Discharged on amlodipine 10mg qd, lisinopril 10mg qd, and 
carvedilol 3.125mg bid, and imdur 60mg qd

#DM2: Holding home NPH, Pioglitazone. HISS and lantus while 
inpt. Transitioned back to home regimen upon discharge and will 
need further optimization on outpatient basis. 

Chronic issues:
===============
#Hypothyroid: continued home levothyroxine  
 
#CAD s/p stents in ___:  Continued home imdur. Held aspirin in 
setting of SDH. Will need to restart aspirin on ___ per NSG.

#HLD: continued home statin  

#CKD: baseline Cr 1.8-2, likely ___ DM and HTN. Cr 1.8 on 
admission and remained stable.  
 
#Parkinsons: ___ have contributed to falls. Continued home 
carbi/levodopa. 

#BPH: Continued home Flomax.

#GERD: Continued home ranitidine   
#Asthma: Continued home Montelukast and Advair

#MEDREC: Continued home VitD, Folic Acid

and take them as directed.
