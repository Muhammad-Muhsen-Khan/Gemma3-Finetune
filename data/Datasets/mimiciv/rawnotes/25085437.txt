History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ right-handed ___ woman 
with
no significant past medical history who presented to OSH with 4
days of intermittent vertigo, lightheadedness, headache, and 
limb
shaking, and was found to have a 13mm left internal carotid
aneurysm. She was transferred to ___ for neurosurgical
evaluation, and neurology was consulted due to question of
dissection. History was obtained via chart review and her son 
who
translated. 

She had been in her usual state of health when on ___ night
at around 7 ___ she experienced sudden onset room spinning 
vertigo
after standing up from a couch. It was associated with vomiting.
According to her son, she could not walk and described 
everything
as moving. She said she "couldn't see" so closed her eyes. They
presented to ___ at approximately 9:30 ___. She
was administered 1L of fluids. On their evaluation, she
reportedly had direction-changing nystagmus, negative skew and
negative HIT. Admission was recommended for MRI, however the
family elected to go home as her symptoms had resolved (by
~12:30AM). The vertigo was constant, lasting the duration of the
above ~5 hours, but also worsened with movement.

She was asymptomatic on ___ and ___.  ___ morning
she was seen at her PCP's office. According to her son she had
difficulty getting out of the car due to recurrent vertigo and
shaking. During the visit, she complained of feeling very weak
and lightheaded, and was shaking and unable to walk. She was
referred to the ___ ED where MRI, CTA, and MRA 
were
ultimately performed due to finding of a 13mm aneurysms of the
extracranial left cervical ICA. She was subsequently transferred 
to ___ for
neurosurgical evaluation. 

She was seen by neurosurgery who did not feel that surgery was
indicated, and will follow her up as an outpatient, likely for
surveillance. They did recommend starting aspirin 325mg daily,
and requested neurology consultation due to question of carotid
dissection associated with the aneurysm, though none had been
interpreted per imaging at ___.   

She has a history of trauma. She "rolled down a hill" ___ years
ago in ___. There was loss of consciousness and head injury.
She fell from a small tree ___ years ago, but did not injure
herself significantly and did not lose consciousness.

dilatation of the circle of ___ vessels. The dural venous
sinuses are patent. The distal vertebral arteries and basilar
artery are patent.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ right-handed ___ woman with no 
significant past medical history who presented to OSH with 4 
days of intermittent vertigo, lightheadedness, headache, and 
whole body trembling, and was found to have a 13mm aneurysm of 
the extracranial left internal carotid artery. Her history is 
significant for remote trauma (falling down a hill with loss of 
consciousness). Her initial examination is notable for positive 
Romberg and generalized shaking which occurred after several 
minutes of remaining upright (though these were absent on repeat 
exam 30 minutes later). Otherwise, there was no nystagmus, 
cranial nerves including hearing were normal, HIT was negative, 
proprioception and coordination were intact. 

She reported that her headaches and episodes of vertigo were 
associated with visual changes described as intermittent bright 
lights flashing in her right eye. Her symptoms completely 
resolved on day of discharge.A diagnosis of vestibular migraine 
was made.
She will be discharged with prn antiemetic to treat vestibular 
migraine. She will follow up with Neurology and Neurosurgery.  

Additionally, admission CXR was read as possible pneumonia vs 
artifact, however after addition of oblique views, it was 
determined that there was no radiologic evidence of pneumonia. 
She had no clinical signs/symptoms of pneumonia.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of vertigo, headache, and 
vision changes resulting from a migraine headache. You were also 
incidentally found to have an aneurysm in your left internal 
carotid artery. While this was not the cause of your symptoms, 
you should follow-up with neurology and neurosurgery. This may 
have come from trauma to your neck many years ago. 
 
 We are changing your medications as follows:  
 START metoclopramide as needed for headache or dizziness. 

 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

 Please follow up with Neurology, Neurosurgery, and your primary 
care physician as listed below.
  
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team
