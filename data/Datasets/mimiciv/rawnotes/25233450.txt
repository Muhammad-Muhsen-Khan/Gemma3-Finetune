History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history 
significant for CAD s/p CABG, DM, HE and  alcoholic cirrhosis 
(MELD-9 + Child Class B) complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma 
with tumor thrombus into right portal vein dx ___ s/p Y-90 
treatment ___ who presented from ___ clinic with 
hypoxemia, abdominal distension, dyspnea, and fatigue. Pt was 
recently admitted to ___ on transfer from ___ for 
RUQ pain in ___, with screening ultrasound demonstrating 
possible cholecystitis. He was subsequently diagnosed with 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and underwent Y-90 treatment to his 
segment VII tumor on ___. A small dose of y-90 was 
administered to prevent lung shunting, and he presented to the 
___ Clinic on ___ for evaluation after his Y-90 treatment. At 
time of follow-up, pt noticed distension of his abdomen with 
dyspnea, fatigue, nausea without vomiting, bloating, worsening 
of pre-existing longstanding back pain. 
 Approximately ___ weeks ago, at the beginning of ___, pt 
reported chills, night sweats, and a hacking cough with 
increased sporadic production of a teaspoon of green mucous. Pt 
notes that a dry cough has been persistently present for years, 
but that this cough differs. He noted occasional small streaks 
of blood present in the sputum. He experienced new onset SOB 
while reclining, not endorsing PND, exertional dyspnea, or chest 
pain. He notes difficulty inspiring, not expiring, and describes 
occasional wheezing. He did endorse increased SOB on ambulation, 
with no chest pain, dizziness, diaphoresis, or arm pain. Pt 
denies prior VTE, though endorses increased swelling of right 
over left ___. Over the past week, he endorsed pre-syncope within 
seconds of standing, with temporary blurry vision, alleviated by 
reclining. 
 Pt additionally endorses ___ RUQ pain, which has made 
sleeping difficult, which worsened for two weeks following the 
procedure, but has improved over the past 4 days. He describes 
the pain as a dull pain that is tender to palpation, comes and 
goes, and does not radiate. He notes that the pain is 
exacerbated positionally and following consumption of fatty 
food, and is alleviated by Tylenol and heating pads. 
 Pt notes increased abdominal distention and bloating over past 
three weeks. He denies previous episodes of ascites or SBP. He 
feels that his appetite is low since the procedure and that his 
voice has become softer and raspier. The patient notes weight 
gain despite eating less. The patient is currently taking 
lactulose, but did not take it on AM of admission as he had to 
leave the house. Pt reports good medication adherence, with no 
recent changes in medications. Pt has regular bowel movements. 
He notes sporadic red blood in stool, well-mixed throughout, 
with last red stool one week prior to admission; denies tarry, 
black stools or visible clots. Pt denies vomiting.
 
ROS positive for increased urinary frequency and hesistancy upon 
initiation of stream without burning.

Radiology :
___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
1. Persistent small to moderate size left pleural effusion with 
left basilar opacification, likely compressive atelectasis. 
2. Low lung volumes.  Mild interstitial abnormality in the right 
lung base may reflect chronic changes and atelectasis. 
  
___ US abdomen
IMPRESSION:  Small amount of ascites 

___ RUQUS
IMPRESSION: 
1. Cholelithiasis. The gallbladder wall is thickened but there 
are no  signs for acute cholecystitis such as distension or 
sonographic ___ sign. This likely relates to the patient's 
chronic liver disease. 
2. Tumor thrombus in the main portal vein appears stable. 
  
___ ECHO
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. Normal left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function (3D LVEF = 60 %). Diastolic function could not be 
assessed using traditional markers. However, E/A ratio is > 1, 
pulmonary D-wave deceleration time is < 220 ms, and mechanical 
mitral A-wave duration is shorter then A-wave flow duration 
suggesting elevated LAP in setting of grade II diastolic 
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined however pulmonary artery acceleration 
time is 130 ms suggesting normal pulmonary vascular resistance. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: 
 1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function.
 2) Grade II diastolic dysfunction with elevated left atrial 
pressure.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history 
significant for alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by 
hepatocellular carcinoma recently diagnosed, as well as diabetes 
and CAD (s/p CABG), who was sent to the ED from ___ clinic 
for volume overload and tense ascites and diagnosed with acute 
diastolic heart failure.

# Volume overload: Pt first noted onset of ascites in setting of 
alcoholic liver cirrhosis several days after Y-90 procedure on 
___. Pt weight 209.8 pounds at admission, which he states is 
about 20 lbs more than his baseline. On initial physical exam, 
abdomen was significantly distended with positive fluid wave, 
prominent abdominal veins, bulging flanks. Tenderness to 
palpation in LLQ and RUQ, peripheral edema 2+ b/l to midshins, 
JVD 10cm. Labs significant for diagnostic tap for SBP with SAAG 
of 2.6, WBC 283 in setting of traumatic tap (RBC ___. On 
ultrasound, pt had no drainable fluid collection. Echo with 
grade II diastolic dysfunction. Volume overload likely secondary 
to diastolic heart dysfunction and medication noncompliance 
causing worsening ascites. Low suspicion for SBP as gram stain 
and culture of ascetic fluid unremarkable. He was diuresed with 
Lasix gtt and then Lasix boluses, with significant volume 
removal. His discharge weight is 186 lbs. On discharge, he was 
breathing well on room air. His home Lasix dose was increased to 
40 mg PO daily from 20mg daily.

#RUQ pain: Hx of cholelithiasis from outside hospital, 
transferred here ___ for possible surgical intervention but 
no infection noted. On presentation, pt described ___ RUQ 
dull, intermittent, pain without radiation that was exacerbated 
by food consumption, which began several days following Y-90 
procedure on ___. Labs notable for elevated AST ___, ALKPHOS 
240s, low WBC 2.8, normal bili. RUQUS done with no concern for 
cholecystitis. Elevated transaminases and dull RUQ likely post 
procedural and secondary to ascities.  LFTs trending down since 
___.  

#Acute diastolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: 
New diagnosis.
EF 60%, with TTE notable for grade II diastolic dysfunction. 
During this admission, he was continued on lisinopril and Lasix 
(as detailed above). On discharge, he was restarted on his home 
spironolactone 25 mg daily, and nadolol 40 mg daily (primarily 
for variceal bleed ppx). He will follow-up with Dr. ___ 
(___) after discharge.

#PNA with hydrothorax: On presentation, pt endorsed three weeks 
of cough with small quanity of green sputum production and 
occasional hemoptysis. SOB worsened on reclining. Vital signs 
stable with no tachycardia or hypoxemia, afebrile. Physical exam 
notable for decreased breath sounds in left lower base. CXR 
notable for prominent pleural effusion with possible infection. 
Labs unremarkable. Pleural effusion likely from hydrothorax iso 
ascites. Less likely to be empyema or parapneumonic effusion as 
patient was very stable. Less likely pulmonary edema iso 
diastolic dysfunction as pulmonary edema was not diffuse. 
Patient treated with IV ceftriazone and azithromycin for 5 days 
with end date ___. On discharge, he was breathing and 
ambulating comfortably on room air.

#Hepatic encephalopahty: Prior history of HE. At home, on 
rifaximin and lactulose. No end-point nystagmus or asterixis 
noted. Gait assessment normal. AOx2 (not oriented to date) on 
presentation. He was given lactulose q2h, which resulted in 
improvement of mental status. On discharge patient is AOx3 and 
back to baseline per wife. ___ cause likely medication 
non compliance and infection (pneumonia).

# Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Patient with recent diagnosis of 
hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor extending into the portal 
vein. Now s/p one treatment of Y-90 radiation. Will follow-up 
with Hepatology (Dr. ___ on discharge.
 
# Alcoholic cirrhosis: Patient has a history of heavy alcohol 
use, but quit drinking ___ years ago and has not consumed alcohol 
since. Heavy drinker from ages ___. Pt endorses no prior 
episodes of ascites. Continued spironolactone and nadolol on 
discharge.  

#Varicies: Grade 1 esophageal varicies without highrisk bleeding 
signs. NO evidence of gastric varices, possible early portal 
gastropathy and antral erythema. Continued home nadolol 40 mg on 
discharge.
- home nadolol for known varices 
 
#HHC?: positive for hereditary hemochromatosis gene. Need old 
records.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___. You were 
admitted for worsening ascites and shortness of breath. Fluid 
from your abdomen shifted up to your lungs causing shortness of 
breath. There was also concern for infection. Your labs came 
back reassuring but we treated with you antibitoics for possible 
pneumonia. We also diuresed you using IV Lasix which is a 
stronger dose of the Lasix you take at home. You were able to 
urinate out all the excess volume and you lost over 20 pounds. 

To prevent this from happening again, it is very important you 
take you medication as prescribed and limit your fluid intake to 
___ liters per day. We will be increasing the dose of your 
Lasix to 40 mg daily. The rest of your medications are the same 
dose as before. Also please weigh yourself every day. If you see 
you weight increase by 3 pounds, call your primary care doctor 
for further instructions.

Also be sure to take your lactulose three times a day to have 
___ bowel movements per day. If you find yourself having less, 
please take the lactulose more often.

We are wishing you all the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
