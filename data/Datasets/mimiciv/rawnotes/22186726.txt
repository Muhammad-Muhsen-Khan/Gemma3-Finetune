Pertinent Results:
PERTINENT STUDIES:
___ Transthoracic Echo Report 
LVEF >55% (visual). Focused study. Large, loculated anterior 
pericardial effusion with failure of full expansion of the right 
ventricular free wall during diastole c/w elevated pericardial 
pressures and tamponade. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function. Due to suboptimal image quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Compared with the prior TTE ___, the findings are 
similar.

___ Transthoracic Echo Report-amended 
LVEF 79% (quant biplane). Suboptimal image quality. Large 
anterior loculated pericardial effusion with echo evidence for 
hemodynamic compromise/tamponade physiology. No prior study 
available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
___ year old female with history of CAD s/p CABG (___), IDDM, 
hypertension, HLD, obesity, sphenoid encephalocele s/p multiple 
repairs with neurosurgery, who presents with chest pain, found 
to have large pericardial effusion, with echogenic but no 
clinical evidence of tamponade. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!
[]Recommend interval TTE (approx in 2 weeks) to monitor 
pericardial effusion, attempted drainage unsuccessful at ___ 
but serial monitoring with TTE with stable effusion, Pulsus 8 on 
discharge - if enlarges or becomes symptomatic, discussion with 
Dr. ___ surgical options
[]Ensure that patient is up-to-date with age-appropriate 
malignancy screening and preventative vaccinations
[]Recommend repeat CT chest in 6 months to follow-up 4 to 5mm 
noncalcified RUL nodule incidentally found during 
hospitalization 
[]Home metoprolol 25mg BID held on discharge, outpatient 
cardiologist to re-initiate as indicated
[]Per cardiac surgery, can follow-up with plastic surgery as 
scheduled, does not need follow-up with cardiac surgery at this 
time

#ERROR!
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
#ERROR!
#Pericardial effusion:
Patient with pericardial effusion after CABG in ___. Per 
surgery, mediastinal fluid collections appear essentially 
unchanged when compared to previous chest CT from ___. 
Hemodynamically stable without clinical tamponade; however, TTE 
with significant impingement of RV in diastole with echo 
findings
of tamponade. Was started on empiric IV antibiotics 
(vanc/cefepime) but discontinued given no signs of infection and 
stability compared to prior CT.  Blood cultures remained 
negative during stay. Pericardiocentesis attempted with ability 
to access the "effusion" but unable to aspirate fluid - in 
discussion with cardiac surgery, likely has become gelatinous 
overtime and would require surgical exploration. Given 
asymptomatic without pulsus or tachycardia on exam, felt not 
worth risks of surgery given her complicated wound healing from 
prior sternotomy. Do not expect collection to rapidly expand 
with stability while inpatient though recommend repeat TTE in 
approximately 2 weeks. Discussed with patient symptoms that 
would warrant call to cardiologist or presentation to ED. Spoke 
with cardiac surgery who felt comfortable with discharge as. 
Plastic surgery evaluated wound before discharge and recommended 
follow-up wit Dr. ___ in clinic on ___ as scheduled. 
Patient reports she is scheduled for sinus surgery in the coming 
weeks. Her ENT and Neurosurgeon were emailed re this 
hospitalization and consideration of pre-op anesthesia eval to 
discuss best course ___, do not believe there is a 
contraindication to general anesthesia, but appopriate 
precautions required with induction including adequate preload 
and avoidance of hypotension.

#ERROR!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
#ERROR!
- You were admitted because you had chest pain and were found to 
have fluid around your heart. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
#ERROR!
- Imaging revealed fluid around her heart.  We will believe this 
is related to your CABG in ___. 
- We started empiric IV antibiotics, given concern for 
infection. However, given stability and lack of fevers, we 
discontinued these. 
- We attempted to sample the fluid around your heart.  However, 
we were unable to access this area. Given your stability under 
our observation, and with discussion with your cardiac surgeron, 
we felt comfortable discharging you with close outpatient follow 
up.
- The plastic surgery team also evaluated your wound while you 
were an inpatient. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
#ERROR!
-Be sure to continue take all your medications and attend her 
appointments as listed below.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
