and diltiazem after 1 week only on torsemide.

ACTIVE HOSPITAL PROBLEMS
#ERROR!
# SYCNOPE: Most likely vasovagal in setting of hypovolemia from 
poor PO intake and possible GI viral illness causing her 
nausea/vomiting, along with restarting of losartan and diltiazem 
after 3 days without these medications. [She reported previously 
feeling unwell on diltiazem, losartan & torsemide, and felt 
improved with stopping of diltiazem & losartan]. Syncope 
happened while she was bending over vomiting into toilet, which 
could certainly increase vagal tone. Infection much less likely. 
Orthostatics, EKG and telemetry reassuring. Antihypertensives 
were initially held. Restarted on her home torsemide 20mg daily. 
Losartan dose was restarted at one-half the previous dose 
(50mg). Diltiazem was not restarted at discharge. Discharge 
vital signs were normal; patient was without lightheadedness.

# DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient was dyspnic overnight 
___, likely due to IV fluids and holding all home 
mediciations. Symptoms improved with 40mg IV Lasix. Discharged 
on regular home torsemide (20mg daily), half of home losartan 
(50mg dialy), and without diltiazem. 

# HTN: As above, reduced dose of losartan and held diltiazem. 
Patient normotensive (120s-150s/50s-60s) throughout admission.   


# ___: Improved with fluids. Baseline ___ (per Dr. ___ 
___. Was 1.5 on admission, improved to 0.8.

CHRONIC, STABLE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
# COPD: No e/o exacerbation. Home Advair/albuterol.
# Asthma: Home monteluekast  
# HLD: Home pravastatin  
# Anxiety/Depression: Home Escitalopram
# Caratacts: Home latanoprost
 

# CODE: Full (presumed). Patient wanted to talk with her son 
about changing this.  
# CONTACT: ___ (son) ___  

#ERROR!
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
#ERROR!
# HYPERTENSION: patient felt improved when holding losartan & 
diltiazem. Losartan restarted, but at half dose (50 mg daily). 
Diltiazem 300 mg daily not restarted. Would monitor BP, 
especially given diastolic HF and restart if patient remains 
hypertensive.
# DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: patient presented likely hypovolemic 
from acute gastroenteritis & home diuretics. Consider dose 
adjustment as needed. 
 # DISCHARGE WEIGHT: 71.8 kg
 # Echo scheduled for patient ___, as ordered by patient's 
cardiologist, ___ 
 # Prolonged QTc: initially 555 msec, repeat down to 444. Would 
consider repeat EKG. 
# COPD: patient previously on prednisone daily, but patient self 
tapered off prior to admission. Reports baseline dyspnea ___. 
Would consider initiation of other therapy, since Advair at 
500/50. 
# ECCHYMOSIS: posterior aspect of RUE, roughly 7 cm x 4 cm. 
Non-tender, no site of phlebotomy/IV access. Would monitor for 
hematoma development/worsening. 
# CODE STATUS: Patient expressed interest in discussing this and 
potentially changing from full code, but wanted to speak with 
her son. Recommend following up in outpatient setting.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted because you fainted (lost consciousness). We 
think this was likely due to dehydration in the setting of 
feeling unwell, taking less food, vomiting, and being on too 
many pills for your blood pressure. 

You improved with some fluids. Your lab values and vital signs 
were much better by the next day.

We are sending you home on your normal torsemide dose, half of 
your losartan dose, and none of your diltiazem, because you told 
us you felt better and had fewer symptoms the week you did not 
take losartan and diltiazem. 

Please be sure to follow up with your primary care doctor and 
cardiologist in the next one to two weeks.

Please return to the nearest hospital if you begin to feel 
unwell again. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

We wish you the best.
-Your ___ Care Team
