after fluids and holding diuretic

BUN initially 45, after fluids was ___ range

Bicarb in ___ range, chloride in ___ range

LFT wnl

Lipase 252 (___)

CEA 3.1 CA125 24 CA ___ (all wnl)

Urine: nitrogen 288, Cre 42, Na 32, K 16, Cl <20, Pro 26, Ca 
<0.8, phos 9.1, bicarb <3, pro/cre 0.6, osm 214

MRCP MPRESSION: 
1. 2.6 cm multiloculated cystic lesion in the pancreatic head
which is in continuity with a dilated main pancreatic duct with
differential dilation of the pancreatic duct in the head and 
neck
when compared to the tail. Findings raise concern for a combined
type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and 
EUS is suggested for further evaluation. No solid components
identified. 
2. Pancreatic atrophy with diffuse abnormal signal intensity,
likely changes of chronic pancreatitis.

EUS ___
Other
findings: _x0095_EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 
and ___ MHz frequency. The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged 
from the duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body 
and tail were imaged from the gastric body and fundus. 
_x0095_Pancreas parenchyma: The parenchyma in the uncinate, head, body 
and tail of the pancreas was homogenous, with a normal _x0093_salt and 
pepper_x0094_ appearance. 
_x0095_Cystic lesion: A 16.2 x 12.6 mm discrete anechoic lesion, 
consistent with a cyst, was noted in the head of the pancreas. 
The walls of the cyst were thin and well-defined. No intrinsic 
mass or debris were noted within the cyst. Multiple septations 
were however seen. Pancreatic duct: The main pancreatic duct 
adjacent to the cyst was dilated. The cyst appeared to 
communicate with the main pancreatic duct.The pancreas duct 
measured 6 mm in maximum diameter in the head of the pancreas. 
In the neck of the pancreas, it measured 4.3 mm. 
_x0095_Bile duct: The bile duct was normal in appearance. No intrinsic 
stones or sludge were noted. The bile duct and the pancreatic 
duct were imaged within the ampulla and appeared normal. 
_x0095_Ampulla: The ampulla appeared normal both endoscopically and 
sonographically, with no evidence of 'fish mouth' appearance. 
_x0095_FNA: FNA was performed. Color doppler was used to determine an 
avascular path for needle aspiration. A 22-gauge needle with a 
stylet was used to perform aspiration. One needle passe was made 
into the cyst. A small amount of thin fluid was aspirated from 
the cyst. Aspirate was sent for cytology + biochemistry. 
_x0095_Of note, the liquid was blood tainted and evidence of self 
containted bleeding within the cyst was seen after the FNA was 
performed.  
Recommendations: _x0095_Follow for response and complications. If any 
abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding 
please call ERCP fellow on call ___.
_x0095_Clear liquid diet when awake, then advance diet as tolerated.
_x0095_Cytology report to follow. Further management will depend on 
results.
_x0095_Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO twice daily X 3 days.
_x0095_Will discuss EUS findings at the Pancreatobiliary 
Multidisciplinary Conference. Further evaluation and 
recommendations based on discussion.
_x0095_Results discussed with the primary team.
 

Cytology from EUS
DIAGNOSIS:
Cyst, head of pancreas, EUS-FNA:
VIRTUALLY ACELLULAR SPECIMEN.
Rare degenerated epithelial cells and acellular debris.

============================================================

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, HTN, stage III CKD and recent 
history of recurrent pancreatitis over the last 2 months who p/w 
post prandial epigastric pain, weight loss and elevated lipase. 
Concern is for mixed IPMN causing biliary obstruction, although 
unclear if potential benefit of surgery would be outweighed by 
potential risks.

#Recurrent acute pancreatitis with combined type IPMN in main 
pancreatic duct: 
Pt with recurrent pancreatitis over the last 2 months and 17lb 
weight loss. Pt returned with symptoms of pancreatitis and MRCP 
with 2.6 multiloculated cystic lesion in the pancreatic head, 
continuity with the pancreatic duct and dilation of PD in head 
and neck more than tail, concerning for combined type IPMN. EUS
on ___ with polyseptated cyst communicating with PD, felt to be 
likely cause of pancreatitis, s/p FNA with nondiagnostic 
results.  CEA, CA125, ___ wnl. Case discussed extensively 
with pancreatic surgery team and with advanced endoscopy team. 
Pancreatic duct stent was considered but ultimately felt to be 
of unclear benefit, and so this was not pursued but might be in 
the future should her pancreatitis recur. The surgical team felt 
she might be a surgical candidate but wished to pursue further 
evaluation in the outpatient setting. During the ___ 
hospital course she intermittently had brief self resolving LUQ 
pain, although this did not occur in the days prior to her 
discharge. She will continue a low fat diet (received nutrition 
education) and follow-up with surgery in the outpatient setting.

#Acute on chronic CKD:
#Metabolic acidosis
She had initially presented with mild ___, although after fluids 
and holding diuretics her Creatinine improved. Per report her 
baseline was ~1.5, but during the admission she was initially in 
the 1.2-1.5 range, and subsequently trended down further to the 
0.9-1.1 range. Suspect that some of her baseline may be due to 
diuresis.
She also intermittently had hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, 
which appeared to be mixed anion gap/non-anion gap. VBG 
initially showed mild concomitant metabolic and respiratory 
acidosis with mild acidemia, but on repeat was normal. Urine 
studies notable for elevated urine anion gap, potentially 
consistent with mild RTA, although not a clear cut diagnosis. 
She was briefly trialed on sodium bicarb but due to concern for 
sodium load and mild nature of acidosis, which may be 
self-resolving, this was stopped. Also suspect that this may 
improve once back on Lasix, which was restarted at lower dose on 
discharge. She has close follow-up with her PCP and will need 
BMP checked as outpatient. 

#HTN:
#Edema 
Patient reports challenging BP control as outpatient, with 
dizziness at high doses of antihypertensives but high systolics 
when doses have been reduced. (Of note has a high pulse 
pressure). Titration of labetalol sounds as though it has been 
the recent focus. Here her valsartan and Lasix were held during 
most of the admission, and amlodipine initially increased. BPs 
fluctuated from 100s-180s, suggesting a degree of dysautonomia. 
A strategy of mild permissive hypertension seemed to minimize 
her dizziness, and this may be considered given her large pulse 
pressure. At discharge she was restarted on a reduced dose of 
Lasix since she had developed some mild peripheral edema, and 
her amlodipine was reduced back to the home doseage of 2.5. Her 
labetalol was continued at home dose. Her ___ was held but 
should likely be restarted in the outpatient setting.

#CAD s/p PCI in ___: asymptomatic currently
Continued ASA, statin, labetalol

#Chronic neuropathic pain: 
Neurontin dosing initially reduced due to ___, but given 
improvement in Creatinine was discharged on prior dose. 

#DM: held oral hypoglycemic during admission with sliding scale 
coverage

=======================================
Transitional issue:

- patient will follow-up in clinic with pancreaticobiliary 
surgery team

- should patient have recurrent pancreatitis should be 
transferred to ___ for consideration of pancreatic duct stent

- close follow-up with PCP, at which time she should have BMP to 
evaluate renal function and acid-base status

- continued titration of BP regimen; given wide pulse pressure 
and erratic pressure, and dizziness at higher doses, may adopt a 
strategy of some permissive HTN or consider 24 hour monitoring 
at home

=======================================

>30 minutes in patient care and coordination of discharge

Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
-Recurrent acute pancreatitis with combined type IPMN in main
pancreatic duct:
-Acute on chronic CKD:
-Metabolic acidosis
-HTN
-DM

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because of your recent pancreatitis episodes 
and found to have a cystic lesion in your pancreas, which we 
believe is an "IPMN" (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm), 
which are typically benign lesions, although they in some cases 
can develop into cancers. After evaluation by the advanced 
endoscopy team, it was felt that at this time a pancreatic duct 
stent would not be helpful. However if you develop pancreatitis 
again this might be considered. You were also evaluated by the 
pancreatic surgeons, who plan to see you in the office as an 
outpatient to further consider the possibility of a surgery, 
with the goal of preventing future episodes. 

In the mean time we have recommended a low fat diet, since fat 
can stimulate the pancreas. If you develop severe abdominal pain 
you should seek care. It is ok to go to ___ initially, 
but if you are found to have another episode of pancreatitis 
then you should be sent from there back to ___.

While you were here we also made some minor adjustments to your 
blood pressure medications, which Dr. ___ continue to 
work on when he sees you. 
 
Followup Instructions:
