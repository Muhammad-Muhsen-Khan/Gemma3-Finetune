MRI Brain
FINDINGS:  
  
There is a small focal region of slow diffusion within the right 
paramedian 
pons with trace corresponding FLAIR hyperintensity compatible 
with acute 
infarct.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, 
mass effect or 
midline shift.  The basilar cisterns remain patent. 
  
As before, patient is status post left frontoparietal craniotomy 
with 
underlying left frontal, temporal and parietal lobe volume loss 
and stable 
T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensity.  There is been progressive 
volume loss 
of the left frontal and temporoparietal parenchyma since head CT 
from ___.  
In the setting of known chronic occlusion of the left internal 
carotid artery, 
this finding is suggestive of insufficient collateral supply to 
this region.  
Foci of increased signal loss on the gradient echo images 
underlying the 
craniotomy site may reflect calcifications, as noted on the 
recent head CT, 
+/-  hemosiderin deposition related to old hemorrhage.  There is 
mild ex vacuo 
dilatation of the left lateral ventricle occipital and temporal 
horns. 
  
There is mild ethmoid mucosal thickening.  A left maxillary 
sinus mucosal 
retention cyst is seen.  A left mastoid effusion is noted.  The 
patient is 
status post bilateral lens replacement. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Small right paramedian pontine acute infarction. 
2. No evidence of mass or hemorrhage. 
3. Progressive left hemisphere volume loss since ___ suggests 
ongoing 
ischemia in the setting of known chronic occlusion of the left 
internal 
carotid artery. 

CTA head and neck
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. CT HEAD: Status post left frontoparietal craniotomy with 
underlying volume 
loss and postoperative changes.  Subcentimeter hypodensity 
within the right 
paramedian pons, not seen on the previous head CT dated ___, may 
reflect acute infarct.  This findings is confirmed on subsequent 
MRI performed 
___ at 01:25 hours. Progressive volume loss of the 
left parietal, 
frontal and temporal lobes since ___ suggests insufficient 
collateral 
vessels. 
2. CTA HEAD: Redemonstrated chronic occlusion of the 
intracranial left 
internal carotid artery.  There is normal filling of the left 
anterior and 
middle cerebral arteries. 
3. There is a 4 mm saccular aneurysm at the right middle 
cerebral artery 
bifurcation.  Otherwise, the vessels of the circle of ___ 
appear within 
normal limits. 
4. CTA NECK: Chronic occlusion of the left common carotid artery 
from the 
level just above its origin.  Mild atherosclerotic 
calcifications involving 
the right carotid bifurcation without stenosis by NASCET 
criteria.  No 
evidence of acute dissection or aneurysm formation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with prior left frontal stroke 
in ___ and
subsequent memory difficulties, acute on chronic left SDH, 
facial
spasms, and complex partial seizures as well as HTN, poorly
controlled DM (A1c 6.8%), and HLD who was admitted to the 
Neurology stroke service with dysarthria secondary to an acute 
ischemic stroke in the right paramedian pons. Her stroke was 
most likely secondary to a small artery event event given 
involvement of the perforator arteries off of the basilar 
artery. She was not on any antiplatelet therapy prior to this 
hospitalization. She was started on antiplatelet therapy of  
Plavix 75 mg given ASA allergy. She continued to have dysarthria 
compared to her baseline speech, but her speech was intelligible 
and she did not experience any dysphagia. Discussed with her 
daughter/HCP plan for discharge home. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#Right paramedian pontine acute infarction ___ small artery
disease.  
Patient has reported allergy to aspirin, and was started on 
Plavix 75 mg and Atorvastatin 40 mg. She was seen by ___, who 
found no new motor deficits and felt she was mobilizing at her 
baseline and was safe for discharge home. We provided a 1 week 
prescription of medication at her local pharmacy, and sent the 
rest to her mail order pharmacy where her medications are bubble 
packed for her. 

#Hypertension
Home torsemide 10mg daily was continued, along with labetalol 
700mg TID. Her blood pressures were well controlled during 
hospitalization, and she should continue to follow up with her 
PCP to maintain goal normotension. 

#Diabetes
Hemoglobin a1c 6.8. She was seen by ___, who made some minor 
changes to regimen while inpatient and recommended continuation 
of home regimen on discharge. 

#Seizures
Her home Lamotrigine 150mg QAM and 100mg QPM was continued. 

#Mood
Continued on home risperidone 2mg PO QHS. 

___
Creatinine 2.2 on admission, she was given a small amount of IVF 
and this downtrended to baseline 1.9. 

#Transitional issues
- Follow up with PCP ___: 1) continued blood sugar control, 2) 
blood pressure control and risk factor optimization, 3) 
incidental finding of multiple hypoattenuating lesions of the 
left thyroid lobe which measure up to 5 mm, 4) elevated TSH at 
5.6
- Follow up with stroke neurology; you will be called with an 
appointment. 

  
Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c  6.8%
2) Hyperlipidemia: Started on atorvastatin 40 mg on  with LDL 
115

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
High cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes

We are changing your medications as follows:
- START Plavix 75 mg daily to prevent future stroke events
- START Atorvastatin 40 mg daily to decrease your blood 
cholesterol 

We have sent a 2 week supply of these medications to ___ in 
___. We have sent 6 months of refills to your mail order 
pharmacy so that they can be put in blister packs for you. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed without 
changes. You should continue to check your blood sugars after 
meals as you did before and follow up with your PCP. 

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
