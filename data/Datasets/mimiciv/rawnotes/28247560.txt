Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
#ERROR!
Ms. ___ is a ___ Y/o F w/ Crohn's disease s/p total 
proctocolectomy w/ end ileostomy, urostomy, and multiple 
intraabdominal abscesses, on TPN, Afib, asthma and ___ 
Disease, who presented for hypokalemia ___ setting of GI losses 
from increased diuretics. Lasix was discontinued and she 
received aggressive repletion. Without diuretics, she became 
fluid overloaded and was very uncomfortable, so initially was 
started on potassium sparing diuretic, then also required 
Torsemide, which she was discharged on. Her TPN potassium was 
also increased and she did not require daily repletion of 
potassium at time of discharge. Her course was further 
complicated by sinus tachycardia, acute on chronic heart failure 
with preserved ejection fraction, acute blood loss anemia 
requiring transfusion, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

**Of note, she had a prolonged hospitalization and was initially 
hesitant to be discharged home, then left the hospital without 
the discharge paperwork stating she was ___ a rush to leave with 
her family. She was called shortly after this was discovered to 
review her medication reconciliation over the phone.**

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!
[ ] recheck electrolytes on ___, replete magnesium to 
2 and potassium to 4
[ ] recheck CBC at followup
[ ] please ensure followup with her endocrinologist 
[ ] if increasing volume status/leg edema, consider uptitrating 
spironolactone and/or Torsemide
[ ] titrate metoprolol for sinus tachycardia, discharged on ___ 
dosing, concern that she was not absorbing succinate as HR 
better controlled with tartrate, though she did not tolerate q6H 
dosing
[ ] will complete 1 more dose of 5-day treatment with levaquin 
for hospital-acquired pneumonia
[ ] repeat EKG to check QTC, which was 500 on admission ___ 
setting of patient taking home Zofran
[ ] hold Zofran until finished course of Levaquin, then start 
twice daily
[ ] incidental soft tissue density lesion ___ the left kidney was 
stable, renal ultrasound recommended previously
[ ] incidental pulmonary nodule seen 
[ ] discharged on flexeril for hand cramping, please stop as 
soon as symptoms improve
[ ] Consider iron supplementation for iron deficiency anemia 
after treatment of infection
[ ] alk phos found to be elevated, would recheck
[ ] mildly elevated INR, thought nutritionally mediated

[ ] Please review medications with her. She left the hospital 
without the paperwork. We called her to tell her the medications 
over the phone but she would benefit from further clarification 
of her new/changed medications at discharge.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#Hypokalemia: 
Hypokalemia to 2.8. She received potassium repletion and 
potassium normalized. Her acute drop ___ potassium attributed to 
increased doses of Lasix. Her home Lasix was stopped and she was 
started on spironolactone and torsemide. She was continued on 
TPN with potassium supplementation. She did not require 
supplement on discharge but if she does ___ future, please ensure 
it is powder, not pills, as these were seen exiting her ostomy 
whole.

#Chronic abdominal pain/nausea:
#Crohn's disease s/p total proctocolectomy w/ end ileostomy, 
urostomy, and multiple intraabdominal abscesses, on TPN
Patient with chronic abdominal pain that remained at baseline, 
but she complained of high output from abscess drains. Abdominal 
pain initially thought due to secondary adrenal insufficiency, 
but this was disproved as she appropriately increased with ___ 
stim test. She continued to have persistent abdominal pain 
throughout the admission, attributed to her Crohns disease. 
Colorectal surgery was consulted for this, and for high output 
from drains, but serial imaging was stable and there was no 
surgical intervention to offer. Inflammatory markers mildly 
elevated. GI team contacted regarding this and said nothing 
actively to do for her known fistulizing disease right now. Her 
RUQ drain was removed prior to discharge due to poor output. She 
continued home dilaudid. For nausea, she was taking TID Zofran 
at home but QTc was prolonged on admission. She had IV Ativan 
available initially which she was taking prior to any intake, 
but over her hospital course her nausea improved and she was 
able to resume Zofran with use ___ x per day. This was held 
briefly on discharge due to pneumonia treatment with 
fluoroquinolone.

#Acute on chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
#Hand cramping
She was ___ sinus tachycardia with associated dyspnea despite 
diuresis and pain control (below). TTE showed preserved systolic 
function, EF 70%. Given tachycardia, dyspnea, and peripheral 
edema ___ setting of malnutrition, there was concern for 
high-output heart function on TTE due to wet beriberi disease. 
She was initiated on thiamine supplementation through her TPN. 
Her thiamine level subsequently was normal. She diuresed well to 
40 mg Torsemide daily however complained that she did not feel 
well when taking it, so dosing was decreased to 20 mg for 
maintenance. Also started and uptitrated spironolactone, but 
this was decreased on discharge due to feeling weak after taking 
diuretics and too much output from her urostomy for patient_x0092_s 
comfort. She developed hand cramping ___ this setting, which 
improved with diuretics and flexeril, which should be 
discontinued as soon as feasible.

#Hx Atrial fibrillation: 
#Sinus tachycardia:
#Exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort
She was not ___ Afib during this hospitalization, rather sinus 
tachycardia on telemetry, had intermittent palpitations with 
exertional dyspnea and chest pain. She was initially on tartrate 
Q6H and heart rates were ___ to low 100s, however later ___ 
hospitalization noted up to the 130s periodically and often 
sustained ___ 110s-120s. Initially this was thought possibly 
related to dehydration from high GI output from drains, acute on 
chronic anemia, and inadequate absorption of metoprolol 
succinate as her heart rates seemed to climb after consolidation 
from tartrate and there was concern for residue ___ her ostomy 
after taking metop succinate. She received IVF resuscitation, 1u 
pRBC, and replaced back on metoprolol tartrate which was 
uptitrated and dosed Q8H for ease of use and better tolerated 
than Q6H dosing. PE was also considered but felt less likely 
with negative DVT studies, troponin, BNP, and no EKG changes. 
Avoided CTA given 2 recent contrast loads. Also possible her 
tachycardia was ___ response to pneumonia as below, and 
deconditioning, though she was independent and did not require 
___ evaluation.

#Hospital-acquired pneumonia:
She developed productive cough during admission with new 
leukocytosis (neutrophilic predominance), found with RML 
consolidation on CXR concerning for HAP. Given risk of MDRO due 
to abx within 30 days (Augmentin ___, she was covered 
with cefepime. Sputum culture grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas and 
she was narrowed on discharge to levofloxacin to complete a 
7-day course (___). Cough treated symptomatically.

#Acute on chronic Anemia ___ acute blood loss: baseline ___. 
Iron labs consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Also concern 
for GI bleed as her hemoglobin dropped to 7.0 requiring 1 unit 
red blood cell. This was thought due to known bloody output from 
her abscess drain and possibly some bone marrow suppression iso 
acute illness. No other signs of bleeding.

#+ UA with E coli pansensitive
Thought likely to be colonization, not treated.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#Depression: continued home citalopram. Noted to have anxiety 
about repeated hospitalizations.

#Hyperglycemia: Noted on chemistry panels, HbA1c 5.6%.
