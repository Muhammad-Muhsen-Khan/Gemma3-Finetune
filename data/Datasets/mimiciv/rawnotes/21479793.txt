History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year-old man with
a history of tachy-brady syndrome s/p BiV pacemaker, CAD s/p
CABG, HFpEF (45%), a fib on warfarin, T2DM, CKD (baseline Cr
1.9), and TIA, with recent admission for subgaleal hematoma in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, ___, and MSSA bacteremia
now getting cefazolin, who presents from rehab with acute kidney
injury and altered mental status.

History was obtained primarily via the patient's daughter and
partner, as patient was oriented to person only. He reportedly
started becoming more confused at rehab and having 
hallucinations
of dancing people in the air beginning the day prior to
admission. He was also noted to be having shaking movements of
hands. He initially showed signs of oliguria so Foley was placed
with immediate output of 650cc. The patient does not report
fevers, chills, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. Unclear if any
falls recently.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.6, HR 99, BP 123/65, RR 18, O2
sat 98% RA

Exam notable for:
Exam: unable to obtain much due to lack of pt cooperation
CV: RRR nl s1/s2
Lungs: anterior fields auscultated, unable to appreciate
crackles, however pt not cooperating
Abd: soft, ND, possible diffuse tenderness
Extr: no edema over BLE
Neuro: AOx person only

ECG: V-paced rhythm, regular rate

Labs showed: WBC 9.3, Hgb 8.9, CK 23, BUN 57, Cr 5.0 (baseline
1.9), INR 5.0, proBNP 23,136, trop 0.13

UA- moderate leukesterase, large blood, 160 RBCs, 83 WBCs, few
bacteria, few yeast

Imaging showed: CXR- Mild pulmonary edema with small left 
pleural
effusion and patchy bibasilar atelectasis. 

Renal US- 1. Limited visualization of the left kidney and 
bladder
is discussed above. Unchanged appearance of right kidney with no
evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Study can be repeated when the patient is more cooperative.

NCHCT- No acute intracranial process.

Consults: Nephrology-
- ___ could be cardiorenal (high BNP, CXR with congestion),
pre-renal or AIN from cefazolin
- send urine lytes, UA. Agree with checking CK
- unsure if AMS is related to ___. ID reckons AMS is partly
related to Cefazolin being overdosed for his CrCl.
- No acute indication for HD
- if volume overloaded - please give IV diuretics. ECHO

Patient received:
IV Ceftriaxone 1 g
IV CeFAZolin 1 g 

Transfer VS were: T 99.2, HR 88, BP 122/68, RR 18, O2 sat 97% RA 


On arrival to the floor, the patient was only minimally able to
participate in the medical interview. He states that he is not 
in
any pain, but was otherwise unable to answer further questions.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
#ERROR!
___ with PMH of tachy-brady syndrome s/p BiV pacemaker, CAD s/p 
CABG, HFrEF (40-45%), afib on warfarin, T2DM, CKD (baseline Cr 
1.9), and TIA, with recent admission for subgaleal hematoma in 
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, ___, and MSSA bacteremia, 
who presented from rehab with acute kidney injury and altered 
mental status. He has AIN thought to be due to cefzolin and 
omeprazole. He received prednisone 50mg PO daily for three days 
and renal function beginning to improve. He was switched to 
daptomycin for MSSA bacteremia. He did have a rash thought to be 
from ?AIN, cefazolin, or daptomycin but improved with steroid 
cream. Diuresis was held given his renal function but concern 
remains that he will accumulate fluid.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
# ___ on CKD: 
Likely AIN vs. cardiorenal in setting of volume overload. CXR 
shows some evidence of congestion and a small pleural effusion 
and he had a significantly elevated BNP, which could point 
towards volume overload, however patient did not appear volume 
overloaded on exam otherwise. AIN seems most likely given acute 
worsening without worsening volume overload in the setting of 
recent cefazolin and PPI. Per family, HD not within GOC. After 
discussions with infectious disease and nephrology the patient 
completed a 3 day course of 50mg of prednisone. His Cr continues 
to improve without any diuresis or IVF.

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy:
# Delirium:
# Sterile pyuria: 
Per the patient's family, he has some degree of baseline 
dementia, but this is significantly off of his baseline, but 
close to where he has been after his prior hospitalization. The 
patient has bacteriuria, but it is unlikely this is a true UTI 
as he has been on antibiotics, s/p 1 dose of CTX in the ED. The 
patient's encephalopathy is likely secondary to uremia and may 
be worsened by steroids among other causes. Also large element 
of delirium with sundowning. Would be cognizant of constipation 
as contributing to delirium. He was calm with stable mental 
status at the time of discharge.

#HFrEF EF 40-45%:
#Heart failure exacerbation:
#Troponinemia:
BNP elevated to >23K, likely due to renal disease. Ddx includes 
___, MI, valve dysfunction, arrhythmia. CXR did not show 
consolidation. Troponin elevated to 0.16, but flat MB makes new 
ischemic disease less likely. Appears euvolemic on exam so held 
diuresis. Can consider diuresis prn weight gain at rehab if 
renal function continue to improve. Continued carvedilol. Held 
irbesartan in setting of ___.

# MSSA bacteremia: 
The patient was being treated for MSSA bacteremia of unclear 
source during his recent admission. TEE was not within goals of 
care and patient was unable to cooperate with spine imaging. 
Plan was for cefazolin for 6 week course to finish on ___. 
However, there is now concern for AIN from cefazolin. Patient 
has allergy to penicillins. Last dose of cefazolin given in ED 
on evening of ___. Therefore, patient switched to daptomycin 
(course to be completed ___ but developed a rash concerning 
for drug eruption ___. Although patient has rash this is likely 
not the cause of his AIN and therefore symptomatically treated 
the rash with hydrocortisone cream and continued daptomycin. He 
had initial PICC placed that patient self-removed, re-placed 
___.

# Coagulopathy: 
Patient had a significantly elevated INR, likely in the setting 
of his antibiotic use and possibly underlying infection, along 
with ___. There were no signs of active bleeding, so patient no 
actively reversed. Warfarin was held on admission, and once INR 
became therapeutic, warfarin was restarted and titrated. Of 
note, PATIENT MISSED A DOSE OF WARFARIN on ___, so will need 
daily INR checks at least for the next few days to titrate 
warfarin.

# Goals of care:
Daughter and HCP ___ reiterated patient's preference to be 
DNR/DNI. Has MOLST in chart. Daughter declined dialysis even if 
___ were to get worse. She was informed that ___ is very 
sick. Given the improvement in his renal function, the decision 
was made for discharge to rehab rather than hospice. However, 
recommend continuous assessment of health status and ongoing 
goals of care discussions. 

# Papular rash, resolved:
Patient with erythematous papular rash on extremities. Greatest 
concern for drug eruption. Rash began on ___ after the 
initiation of daptomycin. The patient's LFTs were normal making 
DRESS less likely. The patient rash improved considerably and 
resolved while on topical hydrocortisone as well as prednisone 
systemically to treat his AIN.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#ERROR!
# Subgaleal hematoma: 
During previous hospitalization, CT head showed a right frontal 
subgaleal hematoma (without fracture) in the setting of 
significantly elevated INR during last admission. Appears stable 
on current NCHCT.

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS 3
The patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 
currently rate-controlled with carvedilol. Warfarin was 
initially held in setting of supratherapeutic INR but was 
restarted and retitrated. See comment re: warfarin above in 
"Coagulopathy."

# CAD s/p CABG:
Held home rosuvastatin while on daptomycin for concern of 
rhabdo.

# Hypertension: 
Continued home carvedilol. Held irbesartan in setting of ___. 

# Chronic anemia:
Currently at baseline in the ___.
