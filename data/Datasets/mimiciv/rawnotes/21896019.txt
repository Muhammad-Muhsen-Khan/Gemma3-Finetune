Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG and recent NSTEMI 
(s/p DES to LM-LCx ___, atrial fibrillation, who initially 
presented to OSH with afib with RVR, transferred to ___ for 
further management. 

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Recent diagnosis of unclear 
duration, incidentally found on annual physical exam. Was noted 
at OSH to be in afib with RVR and received metoprolol and 
quickly became rate controlled. On arrival to ___, after 
interviewing the patient, it became clear he did not take any of 
his medications for the 1.5 days prior to admission due to 
difficulty ambulating to his pills from foot pain. He was 
started on fractionated home doses of metoprolol and diltiazem. 
He was recorded on telemetry to have an episode of profound 
(into the ___, but asymptomatic, bradycardia. No intervention 
was required but his diltiazem dose was decreased and ultimately 
discontinued. He was transitioned to metoprolol succinate 200mg 
daily with adequate rate control and continued on Plavix 
(previous NSTEMI) and Coumadin with plan for point of care INR 
testing going forward with ___.
 
# CAD: Pt has a history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG and 
was recently found to have an NSTEMI in setting of AF w/ rapid 
ventricular rate. He is s/p DES to LM-LCx on ___. Patient 
reported not taking his Plavix or aspirin due to forgetfulness 
and foot pain. He was restarted on Plavix which he should 
continue for at least one year (started ___. He was also 
given aspirin, beta blocker (as per above) and Atorvastatin 80mg 
daily. Patient should stay on triple therapy for at least one 
month (started ___ after which aspirin can be stopped 
while maintained on Plavix. Should undergo TTE as an outpatient. 
Of note, lisinopril and IMDUR were discontinued due to patient 
confusion with medications and well controlled blood pressure.

# Foot Pain: Patient described foot pain as unilateral over L 
great toe. Stated pain was so great that he could not put on his 
shoe. Appeared very sensitive to palpation, warm and red, 
concerning for gout as opposed to initial concern for diabetic 
neuropathy. No evidence of infection. Was started on colchicine 
empiric therapy without crystal confirmation with significant 
improvement. Did not discharge on allopurinol, patient should be 
likely get crystal diagnosis prior to starting allopurinol 
chronically.

# Diminished ADLS: patient has reported difficulty feeling 
steady on his feet as of late and stated that he was having 
difficulty keeping track of his medications (e.g. missing doses 
of Plavix for his stent). His daughter and PCP were concerned 
about his independence. Patient was assessed by physical therapy 
and deemed stable and independent once gout resolved.  Patient 
was also assessed by occupational therapy who noted with 
cognitive testing, pt is functionally able to perform medication
management and demonstrated good safety awareness but did 
exhibit mild deficits in short term memory. Ultimately, with 
discussion with daughter, patient and PCP, decided patient would 
be ok to go home with ___ monitoring and close follow up with 
PCP.

# DIABETES TYPE II: Moderately well controlled, held home 
metformin, and maintained on Humalog insulin sliding scale.  
Resumed on metformin a time of discharge.  

# HYPERTENSION: clinically stable. Discontinued IMDUR and 
Lisinopril dosing, due to BPs in low 100s, asymptomatic and 
patient had difficulty with medication compliance. 

# URINARY RETENTION: Resolved. Patient was discharged on 
previous admission with  Nitrofurantoin for total of 7 days 
which patient stats he completed. His UA was  frankly positive, 
but patient was asymptomatic. No further treatment for UTI 
provided. Patient was voiding well with tamsulosin. Plan for 
patient to f/u with PCP ___ discharge regarding ongoing 
prostate issues and urinary retention.  

# Manic Depression: Mood stable, affect appropriate. Continued 
on Lithium Carbonate 600 mg PO DAILY.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for 
failure to take your medications, rapid heart rate, and foot 
pain.

WHAT HAPPENED DURING YOUR HOSPITAL STAY?
#ERROR!
-You were given your normal home medications with good effect. 
You heart rate slowed down appropriately.  Stopped your 
diltiazem and increased your metoprolol to help prevent your 
heart rate from slowing down too much.
-Your foot pain was determined to be from gout and you were 
treated with a medication called Colchicine as well as Tylenol. 
- You were evaluated by physical therapy who felt that you were 
stable to walk on your own.
- You were deemed medically stable and ready to go home with a 
visiting nurse.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO FOLLOWING DISCHARGE?
#ERROR!
- You should take all of your heart medications as prescribed.
  -- You are now on aspirin. You need to take aspirin everyday. 
If you stop taking aspirin, you risk the stent clotting and 
death. Do not stop taking aspirin until ___. 
  -- You are now on Plavix (also known as clopidogrel). This 
medication helps keep your stent open. Do not stop taking plavix 
unless you are told by your cardiologist. No other doctor can 
tell you to stop taking this medication. Please continue to take 
Plavix with your Coumdain daily going forward. 
  -- We stopped your diltiazem dose to avoid complicated medical 
regimen and stopped your IMDUR and Lisinopril because they 
lowered your blood pressure too much. 
- You should follow up with your PCP and ___ after 
discharge from your rehab.

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay. 
If you have any questions about the care you received, please do 
not hesitate to ask.
