Pertinent Results:
ENDOSCOPIC STUDIES:  
EGD 
- ___:  Patient is s/p partial gastrectomy. Visualized
gastric pouch appeared normal.
The esophagus was patent without strictures.
The duodenum was not visualized as patient is s/p partial
gastrectomy.
Two jejunal limbs were encountered. One limb, believed to be the
efferent limb, was traversed to 40cm until there was a large
amount of solid matter that could not be traversed. There was no
visualized stricture. The second limb, believed to be the
afferent limb, had a large ball of matter, likely barium, that
could not be traversed.
There were no visualized strictures although visualization of 
the
two jejunal limbs was limited by solid matter.
Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o gastric cancer s/p partial gastrectomy in ___, 
esophageal strictures s/p multiple balloon dilations, DVT (on 
xarelto), and multiple small bowel obstructions who is status 
post exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesion ___ at 
OSH, who is transferred to BI from OSH with ongoing small bowel 
obstruction. The patient is hemodynamically stable. She is kept 
on bowel rest with IV fluids, TPN, and abdominal exams. 

Gastroenterology was consulted due to the patient's persistent 
nausea and vomiting. An EGD was done on ___, which showed no 
visualized strictures although visualization of the two jejunal 
limbs was limited by solid matter. The patient was given 
aggressive bowel regimen and had serial abdominal x-rays to 
evaluate the passage of barium and the obstruction. The patient 
was having multiple bowel movements and the obstruction appeared 
to have resolved. 

A venous duplex study was done which was negative for DVT in the 
right lower extremity. Systemic anticoagulation was not 
restarted. Endocrinology was consulted for an incidental finding 
of elevated TSH. They recommended outpatient follow-up and 
rechecking TSH in 3 months, no need to start medication.  

Diet was progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet 
with good tolerability. The patient voided without problem. 
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and denied pain.  
The patient was discharged home with services for her 
pre-existing right ankle wound for which she was receiving wound 
care. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan. She was to follow-up with her surgeon from 
the outside hospital, as well as with her PCP and with GI.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to ___ with an ongoing small bowel 
obstruction after having surgery at an outside hospital. 
Gastroenterology was consulted due to your complicated anatomy 
and prolonged symptoms. They performed an upper endoscopy / EGD 
and found retained food and barium. You were treated with bowel 
rest and were given enemas and laxatives to flush the barium 
through your system. Abdominal x-rays were taken which showed 
progression of contrast through your system, and eventually you 
no longer had any obstructive symptoms. TPN, the nutrition you 
were receiving through your PICC line, has been stopped and you 
are tolerating a regular diet and moving your bowels. You are 
ready to be discharged home to continue your recovery. 

During your work-up, you were noted to have an elevated thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH). Endocrinology was consulted and felt

treated. They recommend you follow-up with your PCP to have ___ 
TSH re-checked in ___ months.
