History of Present Illness:
___ hx depression, new dx migraines, transferred from ___ 
___ with falls and weakness. History taken from 
patient and Neurology consult note from ED(histories are 
consistent).

Patient reports that he began having migraines in ___ of this 
year, typically a pounding sensation with haloes in his vision 
and sensitivity to sound. He began having one of these migraines 
these symptoms 8 days prior to admission which lasted for 3 days 
until he took Fioricet which improved symptoms.

Three days prior to admission he was shaving in the bathroom 
when his legs gave out from under him. There was no prodrome, 
such as palpitations, diaphoresis, tunneling of his vision, or 
dizziness. He felt a tingling sensation in his legs and they 
"felt like jelly." He caught himself on the counter and had 
complete resolution of his weakness so he finished shaving and 
went to the shower where this happened again. It happened a 
third time when he was dressing; this time he fell, but there 
was no head strike or loss of consciousness. He saw his PCP who 
ordered CT Head at ___ that was reportedly negative. Over the 
weekend he was prescribed bedrest and essentially moved only 
small amounts to/from the bathroom or to eat, but then the 
morning of admission he felt recurrence of his symptoms for 
which he went to ___ where pan-spine MRI was done. He was 
brought to ___ ED for concern of possible GBS given his flu 
shot was done 6wks ago.  

No CP, SOB, palpitations, visual symptoms, recent illness or 
symptoms of illness, sick contacts, change in work or home 
environment, incontinence of urine or stool, saddle anesthesia, 
or changes in his appetite or mood. He has loose stools which he 
attributes to not eating; he's had these before and they resolve 
with meals. He does feel tingling down his legs occasionally. He 
has a HA on arrival, c/w migraines.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of migraines who 
presented from ___ with three days of 
intermittent, bilateral lower extremity weakness in the absence 
of any other symptoms. At ___, the patient had a normal 
non-contrast head CT and normal MRI spine. At ___, the 
patient's neurological exam was normal. He underwent lumbar 
puncture; CSF fluid analysis was normal. The patient had MRI/MRA 
brain and EEG, which were normal. TSH was normal. The patient 
was evaluated by ___, who recommended that he go home with a 
rolling walker more due to his hesitation with walking more than 
for any documented weakness on exam. At discharge, the patient 
walked cautiously due to anticipatory anxiety but had normal 
strength. Ultimately, no cause for the patient's weakness was 
identified.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==================
# Weakness: The patient presented from ___ 
with three days of intermittent, bilateral lower extremity 
weakness in the absence of any other symptoms. The patient had 
no change in level of consciousness during any of these 
episodes. At ___, the patient had a normal non-contrast head CT 
and normal MRI spine. At ___, Neurology was consulted. The 
patient's neurological exam was normal. He underwent lumbar 
puncture; CSF fluid analysis was normal including normal protein 
of 37. CSF VDRL was negative. The patient had MRI/MRA brain and 
EEG, which were also normal. TSH was normal. He had no episodes 
of weakness during this hospitalization. The patient was 
evaluated by ___, who recommended that he go home with a rolling 
walker more due to his hesitation with walking than for any 
documented weakness on exam. At discharge, the patient walked 
cautiously due to anticipatory anxiety but had normal strength. 
Ultimately, no cause for the patient's weakness was identified. 
The patient will follow up with Neurology as an outpatient.

===================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================
# Migraines: Continued home Fioricet.
# Depression: Continued home citalopram.
=======================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================
# Patient discharged with walker for stability.
# Please follow-up final CSF studies to look for infection.
# Patient to follow up with Neurology as outpatient.
# Patient given Rx for outpatient physical therapy for 
gait/balance training
# If symptoms recur, consider longer duration EEG to try 
capturing an episode of weakness, as patient did not have 
symptoms during the EEG done while inpatient.
