INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal 
to feel tired or "washed out" after surgery, and this feeling 
should improve over the first few days to week.

your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

MEDICATIONS:
  1)  Take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours around the clock. This is 
an over the counter medication.
  2)  Add oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean 
off this medication in 1 week or sooner.  This is an example on 
how to wean down:
Take 1 tablet every 3 hours as needed x 1 day,

then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days,

prescription list. These meds (senna, colace, miralax) are over 
the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy.
