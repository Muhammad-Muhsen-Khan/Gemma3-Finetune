Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ for 
nephrolithiasis management with a known stone burden worse on 
left vs right. He returns for right sided intervention aftger 
undergoing left sided intervention several weeks ago. He 
underwent cystoscopy, removal of left ureteral stent, right 
ureteral stent placement, right percutaneous lithotripsy, right 
renal access with ultrasound and
fluoroscopic guidance. He tolerated the procedure well, 
recovered in the PACU before transfer to the general surgical 
floor. See the dictated operative note for full details. 
Overnight, the patient was hydrated with intravenous fluids and 
received appropriate perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and 
pain medications. He was sent to CT scan for assessment of 
residual stone burden. On POD1 his labs were rechecked. The PCN 
site was c/d/i and dressing was replaced prior to discharge.   
At discharge on POD1, patient_x0092_s pain was controlled with oral 
pain medications, tolerating regular diet, ambulating without 
assistance, and voiding without difficulty.  He  was explicitly 
advised to follow up as directed as the 
indwelling ureteral stent must be removed and or exchanged and 
additional intervention may be required for any residual stone 
burden.

Discharge Instructions:
You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to

associated with spasm of your ureter.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may be fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed.

your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve
