___, EtOH hepatitis c/b cirrhosis decompensated by HE, 
ascites who p/w generalized weakness, nausea, fatigue. Found to 
have hypoK. Course c/b refeeding.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!
[ ] Please draw chem10 at next visit ___, assess volume status
    [ ] Titrate lyte supplementation - sent home with:
        20 mEQ KCL daily
        400mg TID magnesium
        2 packets neutra-phos BID for 3 day supply
[ ] Consider repeat ECG for QTc monitoring; 530-570ms initially, 
497ms on discharge
[ ] Nadolol held on discharge, may have contributed to patient 
malaise
[ ] Consider downtitrating spironolactone to 100mg daily at 
Liver appt
[ ] Continue to reinforce EtOH abstinence

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#GENERALIZED WEAKNESS, FATIGUE, NAUSEA
#Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
Presented with weakness, fatigue, nausea. Likely a mix of viral 
URI, low PO intake and ongoing diuretics, unable to fill home 
lyte supplementation pills at pharmacy altogether resulting in 
electrolyte derangement. Nadolol was recently started and may 
contribute to some degree to patient malaise.  Given last EGD 
with fairly small non-bleeding varices, nadolol was stopped. 
Otherwise patient provided with supportive care as below.

#HYPOKALEMIA
#HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
#CONCERN FOR REFEEDING
As above for etiology. While inpatient had further drops 
particularly of phosphate concerning for mild refeeding syndrome 
in setting of EtOH use and GI upset. Repleted aggressive with PO 
and discharged on continued oral supplementation with plan for 
close follow up. 

#ETOH CIRRHOSIS 
#ETOH HEPATITIS
Admission MELD = 24, previously decompensated by HE, ascites. 
Admission MDF 24.6, good prognosis. Previously EtOH abstinent 
for 7mos after being diagnosed with cirrhosis, but notes she has 
been having a drink 'every couple of days' for the last few 
months. ETOH on admission 196. SW saw pt but she denied 
drinking. Regarding HCV - she is s/p treatment for HCV with 
documented SVR. Labs stable or improved through hospitalization. 

- VOLUME: no ascites on RUQUS
          continue home furosemide/spironolactone (40/100BID)
          > consider downtitration to 100mg daily as outpatient
- INFECTION: see above, no h/o SBP
- BLEED: known grade II varices and PHG, see above re BB
- ENCEPHALOPATHY: no s/s currently, continue lactulose/rifaximin
- SCREENING: ___ up to date, needs repeat EGD
            (last ___, has scheduled for ___

#LONG QT
Newly noted on admission ECG to have QTc 530 and 570ms, possibly 
iso electrolyte abnormalities or possibly pt taking excess 
ondansetron (home med) iso GI upset. Asx. Improved to 497ms on 
day of discharge. Would consider repeating as outpatient. 
Stopped home ondansetron and spot dosed with 0.5mg lorazepam 
instead for nausea.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA
Hb stable.

#ANXIETY/DEPRESSION
continued citalopram 10 mg tablet daily

#HYPOTHYROIDISM
continued home levothyroxine 100mcg daily
