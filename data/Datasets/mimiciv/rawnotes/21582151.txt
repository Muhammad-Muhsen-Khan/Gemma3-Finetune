RADIOLOGY:
___ CT ABD:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Postoperative changes of distal pancreatectomy and 
splenectomy.  Stranding with peripherally enhancing fluid 
collections measuring up to 2.8 cm adjacent to the suture line 
at the pancreatic body.  Larger dominant peripheral enhancing 
fluid collection ___ the post splenectomy bed measuring up to 13 
cm with a drain ___ place. 
2. Postoperative changes small-bowel and mesenteric lymph node 
resection. 
3. Hyperenhancing portion of the liver likely due to altered 
perfusion ___ the setting of small peripheral portal venous 
branch thrombosis.  Main and other visualized portal vein 
branches are patent.

___ US ABD:
FINDINGS:  
Large collection was identified ___ the left upper quadrant.  ___ 
addition, 
there was a smaller collection ___ the left subhepatic space 
adjacent to the remanent pancreatic tail/body measuring 3.9 x 
3.2 x 2.3 cm during preprocedure imaging.  After successful 
drainage of the left upper quadrant collection, the smaller 
collection ___ the left subhepatic space was re-evaluated and 
became significantly smaller ___ volume.  A previously inserted 
surgical drainage catheter was noted at the tail of the pancreas 
and appeared to have a linear track that communicated with the 
left subhepatic collection.  There may have been improved 
drainage of this smaller collection by the previously placed 
percutaneous drain once mass effect from the left 
subdiaphragmatic collection was relieved. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Successful ultrasound-guided placement of ___ pigtail 
catheter into the left upper quadrant subdiaphragmatic 
collection.  Samples were sent for microbiology evaluation. 
2.  A second smaller collection ___ the left subhepatic space 
became smaller after the drainage of the large collection ___ the 
left upper quadrant. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male s/p distal pancreatectomy, 
splenectomy, small bowel resection ___. On ___ (post op day 
14), patient was seen ___ clinic exhibiting symptoms of early 
satiety and fatigue. On ___, patient was seen ___ the emergency 
room with a fever of 103.7, his WBC was 37.3. Abdominal CT 
demonstrated large intra abdominal fluid collection ___ the post 
operative bed. Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics 
and ___ was consulted for drain placement. On HD 2, patient 
underwent US-guided placement of ___ pigtail catheter into 
the left upper quadrant subdiaphragmatic collection, sample was 
sent for microbiology. Infectious Diseases team was consulted 
for proper antibiotic and duration. On HD 3, patient remained 
afebrile and his WBC returned back to baseline level. On HD 4, 
patient cultures came back positive for Staph aureus coag +, 
sensitive for penicillin. Per ID antibiotics were changed to 
Cefazolin. On HD 5, mid-line was placed and patient was 
discharged home ___ stable condition. He will continue on IV 
antibiotics at home, abdominal ultrasound was scheduled as 
outpatient prior his f/u with surgery and ID team on ___. 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
