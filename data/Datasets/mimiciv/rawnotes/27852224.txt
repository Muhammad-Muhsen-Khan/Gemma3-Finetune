CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 9:29 AM

microperforation and extensive phlegmonous change within the 
right lower quadrant.  A 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.8 cm hypodense area 
adjacent to the appendix is suggestive of a small fluid 
collection, but is not drainable.  No radiopaque appendicolith. 
2. Fibroid uterus. 
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions and minimal dependent 
atelectasis in both lower lobes. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  
Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed acute appendicitis 
concerning for gangrenous changes and microperforations. WBC was 
elevated at 17.2. After careful consideration and discussion of 
the risks and benefits of operating on a gangrenous appendix and 
given the delayed presentation, the patient and attending 
physician decided together to undergo conservative management 
with bowel rest and antibiotics. The patient arrived on the 
floor on IV fluids, metronidazole and ceftriaxone, and 
acetaminophen with a one time dose of IV morphine for pain 
control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable. We advised the 
patient to discard her pumped breast milk while on flagyl which 
she did initially.  She then spoke with her OB on the phone who 
counseled the patient that while most physicians ___ encourage 
her to dump her breast milk, based on her research and knowledge 
it was safe to keep and feed to her child.  
.
When tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain 
medication (acetaminophen) with continued good effect. Diet was 
progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good 
tolerability. The patient voided without problem. During this 
hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was 
adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and 
actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this 
stay.  Prior to discharge the patient was converted to oral 
antibiotics (Augmentin), and discharged with a course completed 
a total of 14 days on antibiotics. There was some concern that 
the patient may have had a PCN allergy.  Patient reported 
possible one time rash as a young child when on PCN, but also 
states she does not recall that actually happening, but that it 
may have happened to her mother who then just told the patient 
that she too had the allergy.  Either way, the patient wanted to 
be discharged on this antibiotic so that she could continue 
breast feeding.  A one time trial dose of Augmentin was given 4 
hours prior to discharge and the patient was observed for an 
allergic reaction, which did not occur.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.
