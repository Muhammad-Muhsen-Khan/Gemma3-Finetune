History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an otherwise healthy ___ woman who had 
previously undergone colonoscopy at ___ number of 
years ago and had demonstrated a number of benign polyps.  She 
subsequently underwent follow-up colonoscopy but number of 
months ago but she had a very poor prep.  Subsequently she 
underwent a CT enterography for an elevated CEA level.  
Surprisingly enterography did not really describe a colonic mass 
but she did
undergo subsequent colonoscopy with a more aggressive prep which 
identified a large fungating tumor in the sigmoid colon. 
Pathology demonstrated only high-grade dysplasia but could not 
rule out invasive cancer. For her part she is fairly 
asymptomatic.  She has no obstructive symptoms.  She has not 
experienced any significant changes in her weight energy or 
appetite.  She is not passing visible blood or tissue per 
rectum. The remainder of the past medical history is otherwise,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after a ___ for a 
Laparoscopic Sigmoid Colectomy for surgical management of your 
sigmoid mass. You have recovered from this procedure well and 
you are now ready to return home. Samples of tissue were taken 
and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for 
analysis. You will receive these pathology results at your 
follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the 
surgeon to contact you regarding these results they will contact 
you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet, are 
passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by 
mouth. You may return home to finish your recovery.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office.

If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
for advice ___:
fever greater than 101.5

incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, 
increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at 
the incision, or swelling of the area.

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub.

Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or 
any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take 
Advil with food. If these medications are not controlling your 
pain to a point where you can ambulate and preform minor tasks,
