IMAGING:
--------
CXR PA/LAT ___:
FINDINGS:  
AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Low lung 
volumes.  
Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted with mild cephalization 
and possible mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No large 
effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures 
are intact. 
IMPRESSION:  
Congestion with possible mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No 
convincing 
evidence for pneumonia. 

KUB ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Course, nodular, and heterogeneous hepatic architecture, 
consistent with cirrhosis. 
2.  3.0 x 1.1 cm suspicious focal area seen on a few views in 
segment ___ of the right lobe that is new in comparison to 
prior, but is an equivocal 
finding.  Recommend 3 month follow-up ultrasound, or follow-up 
with MRI or 
multiphasic CT. 
3.  Splenomegaly. 
4.  Moderate ascites. 
5.  Bilateral simple renal cysts, the largest of which is in the 
right kidney and measures 6.7 x 6.6 x 4.5 cm. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Three-month follow-up ultrasound of the 3.0 
x 1.1 cm 
suspicious focal area in the right hepatic lobe, or follow-up 
with MRI or 
multiphasic CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
#ERROR!
___ man with chronic kidney disease from crescentic IgA 
nephropathy with new AV fistula (not on dialysis) cryptogenic 
cirrhosis getting monthly paracenteses, currently listed for 
dual liver and kidney transplant, and interstitial lung disease 
who presents with confusion as a transfer from ___ 
ED concerning for uremic and hepatic encephalopathy. On arrival 
to our facility, his encephalopathy resolved with frequent 
lactulose. He was started on dialysis while inpatient with 
previously placed AV fistula. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!

Medication changes:
New medications: 
[ ] lactulose 30mL TID or as needed to maintain 3 bowel 
movements per day
[ ] Rifaximin 550mg BID. Prior auth was confirmed while 
inpatient 

Stopped medications: 
- Furosemide 

Changed medications: 
- Metoprolol succinate 100mg --> 50mg qdaily

Hepatology:
[ ] Repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound in 3 months to 
follow-up hepatic lobe lesion 

PCP
[ ] Hepatitis B nonimmune. Recommend initiation of hepatitis B 
series 
[ ] Recommend B12 levels for macrocytic anemia

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
#Encephalopathy
Presented with encephalopathy to ___ emergency department, 
transferred to our facility as patient is listed here for kidney 
and liver transplant. His encephalopathy was felt to be due to 
mixed uremia and hepatic encephalopathy, and resolved with oral 
lactulose administration. 

#ESRD
#Crescentic IgA nephropathy, listed for renal transplant
#Metabolic acidosis
He has had progressive renal failure from crescentic IgA 
nephropathy and has previously been on cyclophosphamide and 
prednisone in ___, which was discontinued in the setting of 
profound anemia, fatigue, and muscle wasting. In the setting of 
worsening acidemia, he was previously on sodium bicarbonate but 
this was discontinued due to fluid retention. This was restarted 
on this admission for metabolic acidosis. Lasix was discontinued 
on admission to allow for volume removal with hemodialysis. PPD 
was read as negative. He is hepatitis B nonimmune. He has had an 
AV fistula previously placed in the outpatient setting, and so 
was started on intermittent HD with HD runs on ___ and ___ 
while inpatient, with plan for ongoing ___ HD at 3:30pm. 

# Cirrhosis, cryptogenic, listed for liver transplant
Admission MELD 21. Reportedly last EGD ___ showed GAVE 
and no esophageal varices. No apparent history of SBP or major 
bleeds. He gets LVP approximately once per month, last two weeks 
prior to presentation. Had a diagnostic paracentesis in our ED 
and did not meet criteria for SBP. Abdominal ultrasound on 
admission showed moderate ascites with R hepatic lobe with 
recommendation for 3 month followup. 

#Thrombocytopenia
Platetlet count ranged from 100-150 during admission. This is 
lower than his baseline plt counts. We attributed this to 
worsening of his liver disease

100 to 50mg qdaily to allow for blood pressure room for
