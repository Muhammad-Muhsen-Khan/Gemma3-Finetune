Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, left leg wound
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo female with PMH of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of 
the vulva s/p radiation and chemotherapy currently on 
immunotherapy presented to the ED after onc visit today revealed 
abnormal labs (creatinine of 5), hypotension, and wound of her 
posterior thigh in the setting of LLE swelling.

Patient was diagnosed with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in 
___, underwent radiation and platinum-based chemo earlier this 
year. She was subsequently found to have refractory disease with 
persistent vulvar lesion and inguinal node spread confirmed on 
biopsy. She was started on immunotherapy in ___. 

The left lower extremity began swelling a month ago. She 
presented to the ED where she had a negative U/S of the LLE. 
However, the swelling has increased. There is some pain  
associated with it and she endorses difficulty with getting 
dressed. She recently noticed irritation on her thigh a few days 
ago and a small lesion was identified. It has minimal serous 
drainage, no pus. She denies fever but has had several days of 
cold sweats.

At her clinic visit today she was hypotensive with abnormal labs 
and was sent to the ED. She admitted to ongoing urinary 
incontinence and fatigue. She also endorsed watery diarrhea, 
which initially began intermittently with chemo/rad but became 
more frequent when starting nevolumab. She started taking an 
anti-diarrheal recently, which has helped.

General surgery, oncology and gyn/oncology were consulted. The 
consensus was that the patient likely was having skin necrosis 
___ immunotherapy or as a progression of her cancer. Debridement 
not recommended due to low evidence for nec/fac on CT as well as 
concern for poor wound healing. Patient will be closely followed 
and if she goes to OR with GYN/ONC, gen surg will participate.

ED Course notable for:  
Afebrile, hypotensive to 70/40's and started on levophed and 
fluids, saturating well on room air. White count was 13.4. 
BUN/CR 98/5. Lactate 1.3. Bicarb 14. UA clean. CXR and left ___ 
___. CT abd/pelvis showed newly ulcerated skin overlying 
left inguinal LAD. No fascial thickening/emphysema. She was 
given clinda, vanc, cefepime.

IMAGING:
#ERROR!
CXR ___: Impression - No acute intrathoracic process 

LLE DUPLEX U/S ___: Impression - Limited study due to 
inability of the patient to tolerate normal compressive 
maneuvers in the left common femoral and femoral veins. There 
was normal wall to wall color flow and spectral waveforms within 
these vessels, suggesting deep venous thrombosis in the left 
lower extremity veins is unlikely. 

CT ABD/PEL ___: Impression:
1. Interval ulceration of the skin surface overlying and 
extending to known metastatic left inguinal lymphadenopathy. No 
fascial thickening or 
subcutaneous emphysema to suggest necrotizing fasciitis. Burden 
of pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy appears grossly similar 
within the limitations of unenhanced scan. No new 
lymphadenopathy. 
2. No other acute findings to explain the patient's signs and 
symptoms within the abdomen or pelvis

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
#ERROR!
___ is a ___ year old female with metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva s/p radiation and 
chemotherapy currently on immunotherapy who presented with 
hypotension, diarrhea, and new labial wounds, concerning for 
autoimmune colitis and skin reaction in the setting of 
checkpoint inhibitor treatment. She initially needed pressors in 
the ICU and was quickly weaned off. She was treated with 
steroids and antibiotics and her symptoms improved.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!
# Diarrhea
She had a few days of diarrhea prior to presentation, which was 
suspected to be in the setting of autoimmune colitis from 
checkpoint inhibitors. She initially had profuse liquid stool 
with complete incontinence, requiring a rectal tube. All 
infectious workup was negative and her diarrhea improved with 
steroids, loperamide, and psyllium. The rectal tube was removed 
and she continued to experience incontinence. ***

# Vulvar rash
# Wounds
# Metastatic Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma
She presented with multiple wounds, including necrotic right 
labium, erosion of the left inguinum and a posterior thigh 
lesion. Initially, she was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and 
clindamycin for concern for advanced infection. She also was 
imaged and both ACS and gyn/onc were consulted for concern of 
necrotizing fasciitis and need for surgical management. There 
were no signs of necrotizing fasciitis and neither service 
believed there was indication for surgical management. Given her 
history of radiation treatment as well as checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy, there was concern for autoimmune rash vs radiation 
recall. Upon transfer from the ICU to the floor, dermatology was 
consulted who believed her rash to be autoimmune in the setting 
of recent checkpoint inhibitor treatment. She was therefore 
started on 1mg/kg steroids with improvement in symptoms during 
her hospitalization. Antibiotics were de-escalated to Bactrim 
based on wound culture data for a 14 day course.

# Hypotension
She initially presented with hypotension, requiring fluid 
resuscitation and 24 hours of levophed in the ICU. Her 
hypotension then resolved and she was later hypertensive and 
restarted on her home antihypertensive medications and 
maintained her blood pressure. Her hypotension was likely 
attributed to diarrhea and ___, therefore not clearing her home 
atenolol.

# Acute kidney injury
On admission, her creatinine was 5 (baseline 0.7). The etiology 
was thought to be pre-renal in the setting of hypotension, 
though nivolumab can also cause. Her home Lisinopril and 
ibuprofen were held, Lisinopril was later restarted once 
creatinine returned to baseline. 

#Metabolic acidosis w/ appropriate respiratory compensation
She presented with an anion gap and low bicarbonate, thought to 
be in the setting of ___. She received a bicarbonate drip in the 
ICU which was later discontinued as her anion gap closed. Her 
acidosis resolved prior to transfer to the floor and did not 
recur during this admission.

# Lower extremity edema
She had bilateral lower extremity edema, left > right. This was 
thought to be in the setting of inguinal lymphadenopathy and 
poor lymphatic circulation. DVT was ruled out with lower 
extremity Doppler ultrasound.

#Pain control
On home oxycodone regimen with IV dilaudid for breakthrough 
pain, which she required in the ICU. On discharge, her pain was 
well controlled with her home PO regimen.

# Leukocytosis
She was noted to have leukocytosis after beginning high dose 
steroids. Other infectious signs and symptoms improved and this 
was thought to be all in the setting of steroid use. Her CBC was 
trended and WBC count on day of discharge was ***.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!
[] It is unclear why she was taking atenolol at home. This was 
restarted during her hospitalization, but it should be discussed 
in the outpatient setting whether to transition her to an 
alternate beta blocker.
[] She will continue on a total of a 14-day course of Bactrim 
for vulvar skin infection. Her antibiotic course is 
___.
[] Once she has completed her course of Bactrim as above, she 
will require once daily SS dosing for prophylaxis while she 
remains on steroids.
