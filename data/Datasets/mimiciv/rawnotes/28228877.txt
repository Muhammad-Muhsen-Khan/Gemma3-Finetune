IMAGING

MRI head ___
IMPRESSION:   
1. Ventriculomegaly involving the lateral and third ventricles 
with narrowing of the cerebral aqueduct with no CSF flow through 
the aqueduct compatible with aqueductal stenosis with 
obstructive hydrocephalus. 
2. Burr hole in the right frontal lobe with a small amount of 
associated 
encephalomalacia likely related to prior intervention. 
ADDENDUM  The degree of ventriculomegaly is relatively unchanged 
in comparison to outside MRI from ___. 

CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study ___, this and placement of 
right 
subclavian PICC line that extends to the lower portion of the 
SVC. 
Otherwise, little change and no evidence of acute pneumonia, 
vascular 
congestion, or pleural effusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted for fever, headache, and loss of consciousness 
of unclear etiology. For his fever and headache, he was started 
on empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis. Neurosurgery was 
consulted who felt that given his history of congenital 
aqueductal stenosis and ventriculomegaphy, it was NOT safe to 
perform lumbar puncture. His headache appeared to improve with 
antibiotics, therefore the safest plan of action was felt to 
continue him on a course for meningitis, despite higher 
likelihood of a viral process. Flu swab was negative and per ID 
recommendations, he was discharged home with a 2 week course of 
IV ceftriaxone for empiric therapy.

His episode of loss of consciousness was evaluated with EKG, 
telemetry, and cardiac enzymes, which were negative. He had no 
orthostatic changes to vital signs. It was felt that this may 
have possibly reflected symptomatic congenital aqueductal 
stenosis. Neurosurgery was consulted to potential perform 
ventriculostomy however felt that this was not urgently 
indicated. He was discharged home with instructions for 
Neurosurgery follow up.

Transitional issues:
[ ] Ceftriaxone ordered for 2 week course of infusion to treat 
for empiric bacterial meningitis.
[ ] Please follow up CBC, CMP which will be ordered on last day 
of 2-week ceftriaxone infusion.
[ ] To be followed up in ___ clinic to discuss therapy 
for congenital aqueductal stenosis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for fever, headache, and loss 
of consciousness. We treated you for a bacterial meningitis; 
since we are unable to sample some of your cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) to rule this out, we will continue to treat you for a 2 
week course of IV ceftriaxone.

As for your episode of loss of consciousness, we are concerned 
that this may be a symptoms of your congenital aqueductal 
stenosis, as our MRI imaging showed that there remains 
obstruction there. Our neurosurgery team did not feel that you 
require urgent surgery. You may follow up with Neurosurgery to 
continue to discuss this.

You will be arranged a visiting home nurse who can also assess 
the need for further home services such as home physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, etc.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you the best.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
