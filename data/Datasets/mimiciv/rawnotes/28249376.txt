On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained on that level 
throughout his admission. He was also placed on 15 minute checks 
status on admission, our lowest level check status, and remained 
on that level of observation throughout while being unit 
restricted.

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Alcohol use disorder: Upon presentation to the unit, patient 
stated that he had recently relapsed on alcohol (drinking about 
1 pint of vodka a few days prior) after being sober for several 
months, in the context of difficulties at his sober house with 
subsequent move to ___, and financial difficulties. He did not 
experience withdrawal symptoms, likely due to short course of 
his relapse. His CBC was within normal limits, but he did 
receive thiamine and folate daily. He was amenable to taking 
naltrexone 50mg PO QD, for alcohol dependence. He did not 
experience any side effects. On discharge, he states that he 
plans to return to his sober house (confirmed with staff), 
continue taking naltrexone, and return to his daily AA meetings 
and sponsor.

#) Unspecified depressive disorder: Upon arrival to the unit, 
patient reported worsening depressed mood, difficulty sleeping 
(about 6 hours per night), worthlessness, hopelessness, and 
amotivation. He attributed these feelings to his alcohol 
relapse, the cold weather, and recent difficulties obtaining 
food stamps and other services. He was amenable to trying 
mirtazapine to target norepinephrine in light of his lethargy. 
His home citalopram 40mg PO QD was decreased to 20mg PO QD, and 
he was started on mirtazapine QHS. However, he started to have 
nightmares, and requested that he be switched back to home 
citalopram. Additionally, he was started on prazosin 1mg PO BID 
for nightmares, with good effect. With time, the patient became 
more visible and participatory in the milieu and in groups, and 
mood improved. On discharge, he states mood is "good" and he 
denies any suicidal thought, intent, or plan. He will be 
discharged to his sober house on citalopram 40mg PO QD and 
prazosin 2mg PO QHS.

3. MEDICAL
#)Hypertension: Patient arrived to the unit with blood pressure 
stably elevated at 150s/80s-90s and heart rate ___ on his home 
regimen. He did have a medical trigger after awakening from a 
nightmare during a nap, with blood pressure elevated to 
170s/90s, with HR ___. EKG was performed and was within normal 
limits. Blood pressure returned to his baseline. Blood pressure 
did improve with initiation of prazosin 1mg PO BID for 
nightmares. He will follow up with his PCP.

#) Wound care: Patient arrived to the ED with left forearm 
lesion. It was treated with antibacterial ointment and kept 
clean, dry, and elevated. Resolved.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  The 
patient_x0092_s primary team met with him daily and various 
psychotherapeutic modalities were utilized during those times. 

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
Patient's sober house was contacted, and confirmed that the 
patient can return pending medical clearance.

#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: citalopram 40mg PO QD, prazosin 2mg PO QHS, 
naltrexone 50mg PO QD
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: patient to return to his sober 
house and to day program

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting this medication, and risks and benefits of possible 
alternatives, including not taking the medication, with this 
patient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to 
take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's 
actively participating in the treatment and discussing any  
questions about medications with the treatment team, and I  
answered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to 
understand and consented to begin the medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to himself based on worsening depressive 
symptoms and intermittent suicidal ideation. Their static 
factors noted at that time include chronic mental illness, 
history of substance abuse, recent discharge from an inpatient 
psychiatric unit, male gender, Caucasian race, age, marital 
status, and chronic medical illness. He also had several 
modifiable risk factors, including suicidal ideation, depressed 
mood, ongoing substance use, and no outpatient providers. We 
addressed these risk factors by continuing his citalopram, 
starting him on prazosin for nightmares, starting him on 
naltrexone for alcohol dependence, and connecting him with 
outpatient treaters. Finally, the patient is being discharged 
with many protective risk factors, including help-seeking 
nature, connection with AA, outpatient treaters, and partial 
hospital program.  Overall, based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others. Our Prognosis 
of this patient overall is fair.
