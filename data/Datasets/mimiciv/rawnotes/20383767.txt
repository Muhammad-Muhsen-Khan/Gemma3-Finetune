IMAGING
#ERROR!
___ Pelvic U/S
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No sonographic evidence of retained products of conception.  
Endometritis is not excluded. 
2.  No adnexal masses are seen, though concomitant ectopic 
pregnancy is not entirely excluded.  Correlation with beta HCG 
is recommended. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
No acute intrathoracic abnormality.

___ CT Head
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities on the noncontrast head 
CT. 
2. There is relative fullness of the brain parenchyma, however 
within expected limits for the patient's age.  If there is high 
clinical concern for cerebellar edema, MRI would be more 
sensitive in this clinical context, if there are no 
contraindications. 
3. Near complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus.  
Moderate mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells. 
 

___ Abdominal U/S
IMPRESSION:  
1.  2.5 cm ill-defined heterogeneous hepatic hypodensity is new 
since ___.  Given the provided clinical history, 
this could represent an area of infection/ abscess.  Recommend 
MR to further evaluate. 
2.  Marked gallbladder wall edema is new in the interval and 
likely reflective of acute hepatitis. 
3.  No evidence of ascites.  The main portal vein is patent. 

___ MRI Spine
IMPRESSION: 
1. Enhancing material in the anterior epidural space throughout 
the cervical spine and extending into the upper thoracic spine.  
Given the clinical history, this is suggestive of epidural 
abscess.  If infection appears unlikely, the differential 
diagnosis would include inflammatory or neoplastic processes 

___ MRI Abdomen
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Diffuse abnormal hepatic signal compatible with hepatitis.  
No evidence of hepatic abscess. 
2. Lobulated hypoenhancing T2 hypointense foci surrounding the 
gallbladder 
fossa, likely representing  areas of liver relatively spared 
from hepatitis or regenerative nodules. 
3.  Severe gallbladder wall thickening secondary to the diffuse 
hepatic 
disease. 
4.  Lobulated cystic lesion in the right mid kidney with 
apparent mildly 
thickened enhancing septum. 
5.  Pulmonary edema. 

___:
CT Head  
1. No evidence of infection, mass, edema or hemorrhage. 
2. Sclerotic right maxillary sinus wall with mucosal secretions, 
suggestive of 
chronic sinusitis. 

___: MRI BRAIN
 
Right maxillary and ethmoid sinus disease.  Otherwise 
unremarkable MRI of the brain. 

___:
MRI CERVIAL AND THORACIC SPINE:
 
The previous enhancement in the anterior epidural space spanning 
from C4-T2 is no longer visualized, likely representing interval 
resolution and treatment response.  Follow-up as clinically 
indicated.

      Performed using the Cobas Ampliprep / Cobas Taqman HIV-1 
Test v2.0. 
      Detection Range: ___ copies/mL. 
      This test is approved for monitoring HIV-1 viral load in 
known
      HIV-positive patients. It is not approved for diagnosis of 
acute HIV
      infection. 
      In symptomatic acute HIV infection (acute retroviral 
syndrome), the
      viral load is usually very high (>>1000 copies/mL). If 
acute HIV
      infection is clinically suspected and there is a 
detectable but low
      viral load, please contact the laboratory for 
interpretation. 
      It is recommended that any NEW positive HIV-1 viral load 
result, in
      the absence of positive serology, be confirmed by 
submitting a new
      sample FOR HIV-1 PCR, in addition to serological testing. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with remote history of IVDU, SAB 8 weeks prior to 
presentation presenting with 3 days of abdominal pain. Patient 
was found to have endometritis and acute liver failure. Liver 
failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity. Patient required 
ICU care and intubation, received N acetylcysteine for liver 
failure. Her liver function improved and her encephalopathy 
improved with lactulose. After extubation she had an episode of 
altered mental status with hand jerking and abnormal posturing. 
She was urgently evaluated by neurology and did not have 
abnormal EEG findings, head CT and MRI without acute process. 
___ have been secondary to acute liver failure. Infectious 
workup unremarkable and patient completed course of IV 
antibiotics for endometritis. She may have had frontal seizures 
and will follow up with neurology as outpatient. With 
downtrending LFTs, normal mental status, and patient afebrile x 
48 hours she was discharged home with plan for new PCP and 
neurology follow up.

INR also down trended from a peak of 7.2 to 1.9. 

#Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy: 
Patient presented with lethargy and somnolence. She initially 
was able to answer some questions and follow some commands. 
However her mental status soon deteriorated and she was 
intubated for airway protection (see below). Her encephalopathy 
was attributed to liver failure. EEG showed generalized sharp 
wave discharges, concerning for either non-convulsive status vs 
sequela of hepatic encephalopathy and she was started on Keppra. 
Patient's mental status improved, she was able to follow 
commands, and her EEG also demonstrated improvement. Patient's 
keppra was discontinued without further evidence of seizure 
activity, and on day of discharge from the ICU, she was able to 
answer questions appropriately and follow commands. She was 
continued on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.  

# SEPSIS 
Patient presented with persistent fevers during admission up to 
102.3 F. She was started on vanc/zosyn for broad spectrum 
coverage. Blood cultures were negative. Fevers initially 
attributed to her acute liver failure. Given persistent fevers, 
and rising T bili to 7, a RUQ u/s was obtained which showed a 
2.5cm hepatic lesion. MRI abdomen showed no concern for abscess. 
Given her history of IVDU, an MR ___ spine was obtained which 
showed concern for abscess at the anterior cervical level, 
though no discrete fluid collection or abscess was identified. 
Repeat MRI without evidence of abscess. ID was consulted. Given 
patient's history of SAB, and initial complaint of pelvic pain 
in the ___, she was started on Augmentin 875mg BID/unasyn 
(___) for endometritis. With downtrending leukocytosis, 
no further fevers, no abdominal or pelvic pain, antibiotics 
discontinued. All other infectious workup including EBV, CMV, 
HIV, HSV negative. Patient remained afebrile x 48 hours and was 
not discharged on any further antibiotics. 

# INTUBATION FOR DEPRESSED MENTAL STATUS: 
Patient initially intubated for depressed mental status. Mental 
status improved and patient was extubated without complications. 
Pt answered questions and followed commands on day of discharge 
from the ICU.

etiologies include seizure, infection, malignancy, toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy. Head imaging unremarkable, EEG without 
seizure activity, and MRI ___ spine without other further 
concerning signs of abscess. Patient was followed closely by 
neurology and psychiatry. There was concern for possible frontal 
seizures vs volitional psychogenic behavior. Patient's mental 
status returned to baseline ___ and she did not have any 
further episodes. Patient discharged with plan for outpatient 
neurology follow up with Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ in 
epilepsy clinic.
