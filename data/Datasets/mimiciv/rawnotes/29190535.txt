felt like as asthma flare, coughing up thick yellow phlegm. He 
was started on a 10 day course of levofloxacin at the time (day

helped, and his sputum again became clear. However, he failed to 
fully improve, and was prescribed a prednisone taper on ___ -

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with ___ notable for atrial fibrillation 
s/p PVI ___, aflutter s/p ablation in the past, liposarcoma 
s/p resection, and asthma who presented as a direct admit with 
symptoms of fevers, chills, and shortness of breath, concerning 
for community acquired pneumonia. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS
=====================
# Asthma Exacerbation 
# Hypoxemia
# Shortness of Breath
# Community Acquired Pneumonia
Patient was noted to have a temperature of 101 on presentation 
at urgent care along with worsening cough, SOB, and hypoxia 
requiring supplemental oxygen. Patient's symptoms were ongoing 
for 3 weeks prior to presentation to the hospital as a direct 
admission. He had failed outpatient levofloxacin therapy. A 
chest x-ray and increased urgent care with concerning for 
pneumonia based on the reports. Based on the patient's history, 
there is concern for bacterial superinfection given duration of 
his symptoms. It was thought that his possible pneumonia could 
have also triggered an asthma exacerbation. The patient was 
started on a prednisone taper initially on ___ prior to 
presenting to the hospital as an outpatient. His physical 
examination was notable for minimal air movement and bibasilar 
crackles. The patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage 
with vancomycin, aztreonam, and azithromycin. Aztreonam was 
chosen for gram-negative coverage in the setting of a penicillin 
allergy. The patient received 1 dose of IV methylprednisolone 
125 mg and was subsequently started on a oral prednisone taper 
on ___. Infectious workup from a pneumonia perspective was 
negative for Legionella, flu, MRSA. Patient's vancomycin was 
discontinued after his MRSA swab was found to be negative. A 
repeat chest x-ray (PA and lateral) did not demonstrate any 
obvious pneumonia. However, by this point the patient had made 
substantial improvement. Patient is initially present on 2 L 
nasal cannula and was rapidly weaned off. His ambulatory sats 
were found to be between 95_x0096_96% on room air on ___. His lung 
exam was trended closely and improve daily. Patient was also 
given leave albuterol nebulizers as needed for shortness of 
breath. Patient was initiated on Bactrim single strength for PJP 
prophylaxis with plan to continue Bactrim for 1 week after 
completion of his prednisone taper.

# Fever
As above, there was concern for community-acquired pneumonia 
based on the presenting symptoms and an outside urgent care 
chest x-ray at ___ that also seemed to 
demonstrate left-sided pneumonia. Nonetheless, a full infectious 
workup was pursued but was found to be unremarkable. The patient 
remained afebrile throughout his hospital stay.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS
=======================
# History of afib/aflutter 
The patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm s/p past ablation. 
He was monitored closely on telemetry. Patient was noted to take 
metoprolol at home on an as-needed basis but this was not 
required in the hospital.

# Hypertension 
Patient's antihypertensives were initially held on admission 
given normotension. His home lisinopril and HCTZ_x0096_spironolactone 
were slowly restarted as tolerated

# Hyperlipidemia 
Is continued on home dose of pravastatin 20 mg daily.

# Primary Prevention
The patient was continued on aspirin 81 mg daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]Prednisone Taper: Taper started at 50mg while inpatient, 
patient to complete with Prednisone 30mg x 2 days ___, 20mg x 2 
days, 10mg x 2 days)
[]PJP Prophylaxis: Continue Bactrim SS for 1 week after 
completion of prednisone taper (last day of prophylaxis ___
[]Allergy: Recommend penicillin allergy testing once patient is 
no longer acutely ill and is off of systemic steroids to 
determine if true allergy
[]Asthma Management: Pulmonary followup as scheduled for further 
management
[]Hypertension: we held the patient's 
spironolactone-hydrochlorothiazide at discharge due to normal BP 
and high-normal potassium (K 4.7 on day of discharge). We 
advised him to check his BP daily (with home BP machine) and to 
resume combo HCTZ/spironolactone if SBP > 150.  It would also be 
reasonable to check his chem10 to assess his potassium level in 
the coming days.
