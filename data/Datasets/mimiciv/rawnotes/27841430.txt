Epi-___ yo M with history of COPD, PVD, BPH, and schizophrenia who

and pneumonia. 

# COPD exacerbation: Resolved. CT chest suggested concurrent 
aspiration pneumonia. CT-PE negative for PE. He has GOLD stage 4 
COPD, FEV1 <30%. Given initial hypoxia he was briefly in the ICU 
but did not require intubation or BiPAP. He received 
ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers and completed a steroid taper. 
He was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and 
narrowed to levofloxacin for total 7-day course (last day ___.

# Paranoia/schizophrenia: During hospitalization pt was 
experiencing paranoia and delirium, likely induced by steroid 
burst. He was evaluated by psychiatry and olanzapine was 
titrated. Bupropion, Mirtazapine and Omeprazole were held due to 
possible deliriogenic effects. 

# Chronic dysphagia: Pt underwent oral and pharyngeal swallowing 
videofluoroscopy ___, with a swallowing pattern correlating to 
a Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) rating of ___. Diet was 
advanced to soft solids and thin liquids. Meds are to be crushed 
in puree. 

# Urinary retention: He had recurrent urinary retention. Foley 
was placed on ___, and he subsequently failed two voiding 
trials. He was discharged with Foley catheter with plan for 
close urology followup as described above. Tamsulosin and 
finasteride were continued. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
---------------
#Constipation: Continued Senna, Colace, miralax.  
#PVD: Continued clopidogrel, aspirin.  
#HLD: Continued atorvastatin.
#GERD: Held omeprazole as above. Continued calcium carbonate. 

Transitional Issues:
--------------------
- Blood pressures were found to be higher in the right arm 
compared to the left. He may have asymptomatic subclavian 
stenosis and further evaluation is deferred to the outpatient 
setting.
- ___ consider restarting Bupropion, Mirtazapine and Omeprazole 
as clinically appropriate. These medications were held due to 
possible contribution to delirium.
- He will need to follow up with urology regarding continued 
urinary retention.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a high count 
of white blood cells in your blood. In the hospital you were 
found to have pneumonia which gave rise to worsening of your 
lung disease. You were treated with antibiotics and other 
medications, and your breathing improved.

During your hospitalization you were feeling confused and 
unsafe. We believe this was due to some of the medications you 
were taking to help improve your breathing. These symptoms 
improved when we decreased the dose of these medications. 

You also had difficulty voiding urine and required placement of 
a Foley catheter. You should follow up with a urologist to 
determine next steps for management of your urinary retention.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
