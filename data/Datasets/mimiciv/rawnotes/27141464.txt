___ CXR :
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change 
in the 
position and appearance of the air-fluid level in the upper left 
hemithorax. Remainder the study is unchanged except for 
progressive decrease in the subcutaneous gas along the left 
lateral chest wall and in the supraclavicular region 
bilaterally. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where she underwent a left thoracotomy, left 
upper lobectomy, bronchoplasty, buttressing of bronchial suture 
line with intercostal muscle and mediastinal lymph node 
dissection. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the 
PACU in stable condition. She maintained stable hemodynamics and 
her pain was controlled with an epidural. Her ___ drain put 
out a moderate amount of serosanguinous fluid and had a small 
air leak.  She remained in the PACU overnight due bed issues and 
was able to use her incentive spirometer and gradually ambulate.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she progressed well.  
Her ___ drain was removed on ___ as the air leak resolved 
and the drainage was minimal.  Her post pull chest xray revealed 
a left apical hydropneumothorax which remained stable on serial 
xrays. Her oxygen was weaned off and her room air saturations 
were 95%.  Her port sites were healing well. 

The Physical Therapy service evaluated her on numerous occasions 
and deemed her safe for discharge home with some home physical 
therapy and a rolling walker.  Her pain was controlled with 
Tylenol and occasional ibuprofen and after an uneventful 
recovery she was discharged to home on ___ and will follow 
up with Dr. ___ in 2 weeks.
