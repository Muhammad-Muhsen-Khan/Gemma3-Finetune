the right hemidiaphragm is of unknown chronicity. Patchy 
atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal 
consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
#ERROR!

# Hypoxia on Exertion
# Dyspnea 
Patient with significant and pulmonary history, followed as an 
outpatient at ___, but at tending Dr. ___ second opinion. 
Noted to desaturate to 69% on ambulation, with associated 
dyspnea and nausea. Came back up to 96% with rest and 
supplemental oxygen. Examination within normal limits, CXR 
without acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, and patient was 
saturating well on room air, with no symptoms. Unclear exact 
etiology given multiple comorbidities, although must outrule 
inaccuracy of SaO2 result given known history of poor peripheral 
oxygen monitoring. Per patient, his has chronically bad pleths 
on his fingers and in the past has required O2 monitoring on his 
earlobe. He underwent ambulatory O2 testing wit a forehead 
monitor, with saturations mostly in the 88-92% range, but with 
one desat to 84% that was brief and asymptomatic. However, the 
patient did not want home O2 set up at this time and requested 
that he be reevaluated with his pulmonologist as an outpatient. 

# Hemoptysis 
# Pulmonary nodules 
# History of lung cancer 
Patient with hemoptysis reported a few months ago, now resolved. 
Ordered for chest CT in clinic with Dr. ___ history of

years ago, but patient declined and said he would do the study 
at
___. Per Dr. ___ consider switching from ___ to 
apixaban if hemoptysis continues 

# Pulmonary HTN: Followed by ___ pulmonology. Mostly 
precapillary pHTN. Recent
pulmonary note documents consideration of trialling tadalafil 
20mg, but patient denies this and he has never taken tadafil. 
Will need outpatient pulmonary follow up on discharge

# Hypomagnesemia: Unclear etiology/baseline. On torsemide at 
home. Was repleted inpatient and patient was discharged on a 
short PO course pending follow-up and repeat lytes with PCP.

received flu shot outpatient per chart

a sliding scale, depending on his
weight

apixaban if hemoptysis continues
