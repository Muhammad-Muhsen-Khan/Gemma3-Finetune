PERTINENT IMAGING:
#ERROR!
___ Right Forearm Xray:
No radiopaque foreign bodies are noted.

___ Chest Xray:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. There is no pericardial effusion. 

___ MSK US RIGHT ELBOW (Preliminary Read):
Superficial thrombophlebitis at the right antecubital fossa. No 
sonographic
evidence of abscess.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or abscesses appreciated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of IVDU on 
suboxone admitted ___ with R antecubital fossa cellulitis 
at the site of an injection drug attempt, status post 
initiation of antibiotics with subsequent improvement, imaging 
without signs of retained foreign body or abscess, able to be 
discharged home on PO antibiotics

# Sepsis secondary to R arm cellulitis 
# R arm superficial thrombophlebitis 
Patient presented with fever, erythema, pain at right 
antecubital fossa following an attempted IV injection of ground 
up suboxone.  He was found to be tachycardic.  Patient was 
initially treated broadly with vancomycin given concern for 
bacteremia (given history of recent injection).  The cellulitis 
improved and his blood cultures remained negative for > 72 
hours, with a TTE negative for any vegetations.  Patient was 
transitioned to PO doxycycline with continued clinical 
improvement.  The erythema resolved, but given persistent 
induration at the R antecubitum, he underwent ultrasound to 
rule out fluid collection--this showed a superficial 
thrombophlebitis.  Educated patient on local conservative 
management including hot compresses and elevation.  

# Opioid Use Disorder
Patient has a history of opioid use disorder and had been 
maintained on suboxone via ___ Faster Paths Program. He 
presented after trying to inject suboxone two weeks prior to 
arrival. He was continued on suboxone here without issues. 
Details of his admission were communicated to his ___ 
clinic.  

TRANSIITONAL ISSUES:
#ERROR!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

Why you were admitted to the hospital:
- You presented with pain and redness in your right arm as well 
as a fever, concerning for an infection in your skin and 
possibly in your blood stream. 

What happened while you were here:
- You were started on intravenous antibiotics to fight the 
infection
- An ultrasound of your heart did not show any problems with the 
valves in your heart
- You were eventually switched from intravenous antibiotics to 
oral antibiotics 
- An ultrasound of your arm did not show any obvious signs of 
infection, but did show a small clot in a small superficial 
vein.

What you should do once you get home:
- Please continue taking the antibiotic (doxycycline)twice 
daily, as prescribed 
- Please keep all of your appointments, details below
- Put warm packs on the clot, and this will eventually go away 
on its own.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team
