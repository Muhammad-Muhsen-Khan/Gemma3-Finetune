discharged with a catheter. The foley was discontinued and had 
continued with his Flomax. He is reporting some dysuria. He also

Studies
#ERROR!
- CXR (___): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

- CTA abd/pelvis (___): IMPRESSION: 1. Mild left-sided
hydronephrosis without obstructing stone and multiple areas 
of hypoenhancement in the left kidney is concerning for
pyelonephritis. 2. Status post open repair of an infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The graft is widely patent.  There 
is
mild stranding surrounding the aneurysm sac in the pelvis, which
may be reactive/postsurgical. 3. Contrast is seen in the native
left common femoral, external and common iliac artery which is
likely due to retrograde flow.  There is a residual 2.5 
x 1.6 cm left common iliac bifurcation aneurysm. 4. Extensive
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 

- CTA Torso ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Status post aortobifemoral
graft which is widely patent.  There is a saccular infrarenal
aortic aneurysm measuring 6.3 x 9.0 cm (series 3:178) with dense
material within the periphery of the aneurysmal sac, all of 
which
is unchanged as compared to outside hospital CT abdomen and
pelvis ___.  An element of intramural hematoma cannot 
be
ruled out. 2. There is a short segmental or longitudinally
oriented dissection of the mid descending thoracic aorta
extending about 1.8 cm (series 3:78 to 87, series 601:53). 3.
Occlusion of the right popliteal artery and a right distal
femoral to right tibioperoneal trunk graft which is patent

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
- You presented to an outside hospital with fevers and pain 
while urinating. They were concerned for an infection so checked 
your blood, urine and did a CT scan of your abdomen. Both your 
urine and blood grew a bacteria called Klebsiella and the CT 
scan showed the urinary tract infection spread to your left 
kidney. The bacteria was sensitive to several antibiotics. You 
were transferred here for further care.
- At ___, your blood cultures and urine cultures were negative 
because of the antibiotics you were on. We kept you on the 
antibiotic and you continued to do very well. You will be 
discharged on ciprofloxacin. 

What to do on discharge?
- Follow up with your hematologist. Your blood count showed your 
white blood cell count was a little low (lowest neutrophil count 
850). Today, it is 1500 which is more reassuring. 
- Follow up with vascular surgery within 1 week given your 
recent procedure. Follow up with your primary care doctor as 
well. 
- You have not smoked a cigarette since being admitted. 
Congratulations! We encourage you to stop smoking. Your CT scan 
showed some lung changes from your long term smoking. To prevent 
further damage, it is important you stop smoking. 
- Please get your blood work done on ___. These 
labs will be faxed to your primary care doctor.  
- New medications:
  Ciprofloxacin to treat your kidney infection or 
pyelonephritis, take 500mg every 12 hours for 10 more days. Your 
first dose will be tonight. End date is ___ morning dose. 
  Topical witch ___ pads for your hemorrhoids 
  Topical hydrocortisone cream for hemorrhoids 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  

Sincerely,

Your ___ Healthcare Team
