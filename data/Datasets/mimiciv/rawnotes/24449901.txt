History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo ___ speaking M with history of 
diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, gout, and BPH, who was 
referred from primary care clinic for ___ and hyperkalemia. 
History was obtained in the presence of the wife, who helped in 
the translation.

Mr. ___ presented started experiencing right toe redness, 
tenderness, and swelling on ___ in the absence of any foot 
trauma. ___ attributed his symptoms to gout and did not initially 
seek medical attention. Due to the persistence of his symptoms, 
___ presented to ___ ED on ___. There, ___ had an US that showed 
fluid collection formation in the location of inflamed bunion, 
so ___ underwent joint aspiration for culture, and was discharged 
home on Keflex and Bactrim. Since initiation of antibiotics, his 
right foot pain slowly improved.
On his PCP ___ appointment on ___, the toe and forefoot 
were found to be slightly improved, with persistent redness but 
minimal pain in the affected area. Culture from ___ returned and 
were notable for staph infection that was sensitive to both 
antibiotics, so plan was to stop Bactrim and extend Keflex for 3 
additional days for a total of 10 days. During this visit, PCP 
ordered routine labs as well as ESR and CRP. Labs from this 
visit were notable for a rise in Creatinine to 2.3 (baseline is 
1.2) and potassium to 5.8 so patient was referred to the ED.

4. Massively enlarged prostate. 

EKG:

interval are borderline prolonged, no peaked T waves

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
gout, and BPH, who was referred from Primary Care clinic for ___ 
and hyperkalemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
___: Patient was found to have elevation in Creatinine to 2.1 
from a baseline of 1.2, in context of recent Bactrim treatment. 
Pelvic ultrasound showed massively enlarged prostate, but 
patient denied any new urinary retention or changes in urinary 
frequency or quantity to explain a post-obstructive etiology of 
___ was likely drug-induced secondary to Bactrim. Bactrim 
was stopped and patient received IVF, with subsequent decrease 
in Creatinine to 1.3 on ___.

#Hyperkalemia: Ppatient had elevated potassium up to 6 without 
any symptoms or ECG changes. ___ received kayexalate and Lasix 10 
mg IV, with subsequent decrease in potassium to 4.6 on ___. We 
also held enalapril.

#Infected Bursitis: Patient had a resolving inflamed bunion due 
to infection with  pansensitive staph. We continued Keflex until 
___ for a total duration of 10 days, as directed by his PCP.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#Diabetes: Diabetes is managed with diet and exercise at home. 
We placed patient on ISS. 

#Hypertension: We continued home amlodipine 10 mg daily.

#CAD primary prevention: We continued home aspirin once per day 
instead of twice daily..

#BPH: We continued home finasteride 5 mg tab/day and terazosin 2 
mg capsule.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:***
- Check Creatinine and ensure resolution ___ (baseline 
Creatinine around 1.2)
- Check potassium and ensure resolution of hyperkalemia
- We stopped enalapril due to hyperkalemia, consider restarting 
it
- Consider switching simvastatin to another type of statin, due 
to interaction between simvastatin and amlodipine leading to 
increased risk of myopathy
- Patient was found to have massively enlarges prostate on 
ultrasound in the absence of change in urinary habits, consider 
up-titrating BPH medications
- Patient should continue taking Keflex for infected bursitis 
for one more day in order to complete a 10 day course of 
antibiotics (end ___
- Patient's heart rate was ranging between ___, likely sinus 
bradycardia, asymptomatic
- We changed the frequency of aspirin 81 mg (for CAD primary 
prevention) from twice daily to once daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You came to the hospital because you were found 
to have kidney injury and elevated level of potassium in your 
blood. The kidney injury is likely a side effect of one of the 
antibiotics you were taking (Bactrim). We stopped Bactrim and 
gave you fluids and your kidney function improved. Also, we 
monitored your blood levels of potassium and gave you 
medications to help excrete the potassium off your system. Your 
potassium level was back to normal. 

We stopped the medication Enalapril because it might elevate the 
level of potassium in your blood; please discuss restarting this 
medication with your primary care physician. Make sure to follow 
up with your doctors as ___.

Best regards,
Your ___ team
