IMAGING
-------
CT ABD/PELVIS:  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. There is no acute abnormality visualized within the imaged 
portion of the abdomen and pelvis. 
2. Post surgical changes related to bladder and prostate removal 
and 
ureterostomy are noted.  Left-sided moderate 
hydroureteronephrosis, the acuity of which is uncertain in this 
postoperative state.  No asymmetric perinephric stranding or 
adjacent fluid collection.  No obstructing renal calculus. 
3. Lucent lesion within the L4 vertebral body which is possibly 
but not 
definitively a hemangioma.  Correlation with prior imaging 
presumed performed elsewhere suggested otherwise MRI on a 
nonurgent basis would be suggested. 
4. Abnormal left pelvic sidewall soft tissue, potentially an 
metastatic lymph node.  Additional borderline enlarged right 
common iliac lymph node to be correlated with prior imaging.

adjacent muscle removal in ___ for bladder cancer (at 
___), with urostomy in place, HTN and NIDDM presents with 
fever and fatigue and found to have MDR E. Coli UTI, treated 
initially with meropenem and treated with ertapenem as an 
outpatient. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
-------------- 
 # Complicated UTI- Pt presents with fever (temp of 102), mild 
lower quadrant pain, vomiting with UA with many WBCs and 
bacteria. Urine culture grew out MDR E. Coli sensitive to 
carbapenems. There was no e/o pyelonephritis, no perinephric 
stranding or adjacent fluid collection and no obstructing renal 
calculus seen on CTA. Hydroureter was seen on CT and per 
urology, there is nothing to do and to follow up as outpatient. 
Patient was treated with meropenem (___) and will be 
discharged on ertapenem for a ___nding on ___. 
Blood cultures were negative.

 # hx of bladder cancer- s/p total bladder, prostate, adjacent 
muscle removal in ___ for bladder cancer and has 
urostomy. Abd/pelvis CT from ___ shows abnormal left pelvic 
sidewall soft tissue, potentially an metastatic lymph node and 
additional borderline enlarged right common iliac lymph node to 
be correlated with prior imaging. He never received 
chemotherapy/radiation. He will have outpatient follow up with 
the ___ clinic.

#Acute Kidney Injury: Patient came in with Cr of 1.5 that 
improved with fluids. Per OSH records, baseline appears to be 
~1.0-1.2. Discharge Cr was 1.3.
