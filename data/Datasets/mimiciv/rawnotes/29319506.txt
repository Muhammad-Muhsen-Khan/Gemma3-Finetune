History of Present Illness:
___ M with h/o COPD on home O2 and daily prednisone, secondary 
adrenal insufficiency, diastolic heart failure, Crohn's disease 
s/p colectomy, CCY, splenectomy, DVT on Coumadin who presented 
to the ED with shortness of breath.  
 He is on O2 at home, but recently stopped using it and was on 
room air. A couple of weeks ago he felt short of breath and 
started using it again, and has gone from 2.5 to 6 L today. He 
reported that at home he was satting 89-91% on 4L. Reports ran 
out of symbicort and nebulizer and off of them for a few weeks. 
___ the past few weeks his torsemide was increased from 40 mg 
BID to 80 mg BID. Despite this increase in torsemide, he reports 
that his weight has increased over 10 lbs in the past week, and 
5 lbs in the past 2 days alone.  
 Of note, he is seen by Dr. ___ as an outpatient, 
and has required outpatient IV Lasix infusions to control his 
symptoms, but has still been difficult to control. During his 
last hospitalization for a CHF exacerbation he required a Lasix 
gtt with diuril boluses. He was previously on Bumex but failed 
this. He is ___ Class III based on his symptoms.  
 He denies fever, chills, cough, wheezing, headache, vomiting, 
pain with urination. Endorses lightheadedness, increasing 
swelling in his legs, pain in the right flank over the past 5 
days. I spoke with his wife over the phone, who notes he has 
been more fatigued and has not been putting out as much urine 
over the past few days.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with h/o COPD on home O2, diastolic heart failure, Crohn's 
disease s/p colectomy, CCY, splenectomy, DVT on Coumadin who 
presented to the ED with shortness of breath likely secondary to 
heart failure exacerbation. 
 
ACTIVE ISSUES:  
# Acute on chronic HFpEF (EF 60%): Patient with significant 
weight gain and increased O2 requirement at home (requiring 5L, 
baseline 3L). Appears volume overloaded on exam with rhonchi and 
lower extremity edema. CXR with evidence of bilateral pleural 
edema. His BNP is normal-however given his obesity his BNP is 
consistently <1000. Maintained on low sodium diet and 1.5L fluid 
restriction. Diuresed with IV Lasix drip with significant 
improvement in volume status. Discharged on Torsemide 100mg BID 
and Metoprolol Succinate XL 100mg. 

# COPD: COPD at baseline that usually requires O2 at home. COPD 
contributes to dyspnea at baseline. He had not been taking 
controller medications at home. Treated with duonebs, Advair and 
albuterol. Was taking Symbicort at home; was using as a rescue 
inhaler. Was unable to fill prescription at time of discharge, 
was discharged on Advair 500/50.   

# ___ on CKD: Cr up to 1.9 from baseline of approx. 1.5. Likely 
cardiorenal etiology although did not markedly improve with 
diuresis. Of note, has had vein mapping of L arm. Monitor Cr as 
an outpatient. 
 
# Troponinemia: elevated to 0.2->.05->.06, likely demand in the 
setting of heart failure exacerbation. At this time, no residual 
EKG changes.  

#R Flank pain: Initially concerning for pyelo, but his UA is 
bland, without leuks or WBCs, and so most likely of MSK 
etiology. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
# Crohn's disease: On Prednisone 10mg, decreased to 9mg 
following discussion with PCP. F/u with outpt GI, continue 
Loperamide.  
# H/o adrenal insufficiency: reported, in the setting of daily 
prednisone use for Crohn's. Tapered from Prednisone 10mg to 9mg 
following discussion with PCP. 
# H/o DVT: Had two prior DVT, on lifelong anticoagulation. 
Continue home dose Coumadin 8mg 6 days/wk and 5mg on ___.  

# OSA- on CPAP at home  
# Chronic pain: On a narcotics agreement, continue oxycontin 20
