Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ service after 
bipolar transurethral resection of prostate. No concerning 
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative 
note for details. He patient received ___ antibiotic 
prophylaxis. The patient's postoperative course was 
uncomplicated. He received intravenous antibiotics and 
continuous bladder irrigation overnight. On POD1 the CBI was 
discontinued and Foley catheter was removed with an active 
voiding trial.  Post void residuals were checked and continued 
to rise to over 500cc. His urine was clear and and without 
clots. A coude was replaced but this caused marked distress to 
patient (b/c of his memory impairment) and his wife. Because he 
was voiding we attempted repeat void trial overnight with 
frequent PVR checks and straight catheterization PRN. He 
continued to have high PVRs so again, on POD2, a catheter was 
replaced and secured with multiple devices to minimize risk of 
trauma.  He remained a-febrile throughout his hospital stay.  At 
discharge, the patient had pain well controlled with oral pain 
medications, was tolerating regular diet, ambulating without 
assistance, and with well secured foley catherer. He was given 
pyridium and oral pain medications on discharge and a course of 
antibiotics along with explicit instructions to follow up in 
clinic for repeat void trial in a few days.
