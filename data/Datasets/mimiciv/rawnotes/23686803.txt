ACUTE ISSUES
#ERROR!
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: TTE on ___ LVEF 
55%. Presented with elevated BNP, weight gain and signs of mild 
pulmonary edema. Troponins negative and EKG without ischemia. 
Diuresed with 40mg IV furosemide once with -3L on ___ with 
improved volume exam and resolution of AFib RVR.  He continued 
to require IV diuresis for persistent volume overload.  Daily 
weights were checked and I/Os monitored. Weight at discharge was 
65.27kg. He will be discharged on Lasix 10mg PO daily.  He 
should have standing weights checked daily and his PCP should be 
contacted if his weight increases by more than 3 lbs.

# Left upper lobe opacity: attributed to pneumonia during last 
admission and treated for CAP with ceftriaxone/azithromycin with 
improvement.  There have also been concern for malignancy with 
previous plans for PET scan interrupted by need for steroids 
which caused hyperglycemia preventing PET-CT. On admission, 
started on empiric HCAP treatment with vancomycin/cefepime by 
ICU team given recent hospitalization and increasing sizeof the 
LUL opacity. Fungal studies were sent and were negative or 
contaminated. Given the absence of fever, chills, leukocytosis 
above recent discharge level, cough above baseline, or new areas 
on CT scan concerning for PNA, and alternate plausible 
explanation for the patient's presentation (acute exacerbation 
of HFpEF), empiric abx were discontinued on ___ and the patient 
was monitored for worsening clinical status. and there was none. 


* Concern for malignancy - He will need PET after infection 
adequately treated; on admission, CT chest findings were felt by 
the ICU/Pulmonary service to be consistent with pneumonia with 
no discrete nodule to biopsy; risks of "blind" bronch/biopsy 
felt to outweigh benefits with severe lung disease, risk for 
intubation and higher concern for infection on admission given 
rapid interval increase in size.  His PCP, ___ is aware of 
these issues and is planning to arrange PET-CT after discharge.

# Acute on chronic toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Thorough 
work-up including Neurology consultation for his anxiety, 
agitation, and hallucinations during last admission revealed no 
specific etiology. Differential included early ___, REM 
sleep behavioral disorder and chronic ischemic cerebrovascular 
disease. Discharged on Seroquel. Given 5 mg IV olanzapine twice 
in the ED. Pneumonia suspected as a cause for acute worsening; 
no other significant metabolic derangements to indicate cause. 
Continued on home Seroquel. Paraneoplastic panel sent given 
concern for possible lung cancer and fungal studies (B glucan, 
galactomannan, histoplasma antigen) sent to rule out indolent 
mycoses. Prazosin started per previous Psychiatric 
recommendations with significant improvement in overnight 
behavior.

# Insomnia: severe. Had been initiated on seroquel QHS and 
prazosin QHS during most recent admission, and insomnia had 
improved modestly, but upon transfer from ICU to the floor, the 
patient continued to complain of severe insomnia.  The causes 
for his insomnia seem to be multifactorial.  Prior to recent 
hospitalizations, he had reportedly been taking ambien and 
increasing doses of benzodiazepines to help with sleep 
(prescribed in ___.  Furthermore, he reportedly has central 
sleep apnea, which results in him awakening with hypopnea/apnea, 
and for which at this point he is not on significant therapy (he 
did not tolerate CPAP). Given he is on multiple QTc prolonging 
meds, QTc was checked and was 454, so after discussion with 
patient's PCP, we increased Seroquel from 25 mg to 50 mg QHS but 
he had visual hallucination on this and he was see by Pallitive 
care. He was started on trazadone 50mg PO QHS and 25mg QHS PRN 
in addition to low dose morphine. His sleep continued to be an 
issue. The patient continually requested unsafe combination of 
medications (Ambien, Xanax and Benadryl) for sedation. He might 
also benefit from treatment with melatonin and this was added 
following discharge. He may benefit from ramelteon but is not on 
formulary at ___.

# Atrial fibrillation: rapid ventricular response in ED likely 
secondary to agitation and volume overload given elevated BNP 
and weight gain. On esmolol gtt in ED given concern for sepsis 
which was weaned quickly in setting of successful diuresis, but 
then required IV metoprolol 5mg x1 with reversion of NSR. 
Continued on home apixaban for anticoagulation and transitioned 
to home metoprolol (started at 50mg q6 then decreased to 37.5mg 
in the setting of hypotension). His rates were well controlled. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
#ERROR!
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stage IV: On ___ NC at 
home (stable during admission). No wheezing and good air 
movement arguing against COPD exacerbation. Continued O2 via NC 
goal O2 >88%, fluticasone-salmterol 500/50 BID, ipratropium neb 
Q6H. Held Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium bromide), Incruse Ellipta 
(umeclidinium), Breo Ellipta (fluticasone-vilanterol) as 
non-formulary.  On transfer to the floor, he continued to 
require O2 on the higher end of his normal (6 L by NC) and did 
report intermittent severe dyspnea.  However, lung exam was not 
clearly consistent with COPD exacerbation (no wheezing or 
rhonchi).  We considered risks/benefits of initiating steroid 
therapy for possible COPD flare, but felt risks of increasing 
agitation/psychosis + aggravating insomnia outweighed potential 
benefits at this time, given his overall positive response to IV 
diuresis for HFpEF exacerbation. He was seen by palliative care 
and given his significant disease he was started on low dose 
morphine (2.5mg PO Q6 hours PRN) with positive effect. Long 
conversation about goals of care and he determined that he would 
be a DNR/DNI. His ambulatory O2 saturations were in the low ___ 
and high ___ but recover quickly with rest. 

# Central or mixed sleep apnea: Based on report of sleep study 
from ___.  Needs formal sleep lab evaluation and potential 
titration of CPAP or other intervention.  We did not give 
ambien, benzos, or narcotics as these all could potentially 
worsen central sleep apnea.  For sleep, his head of bed should 
be elevated, and he should be on supplemental O2.

# Hypertension: on metoprolol at home for atrial fibrillation 
rate control with normal blood pressures during admission

# Hyperlipidemia: continued home atorvastatin 40mg daily.  

# Coronary artery disease: continued home atorvastatin 40 mg 
daily. Recently discontinued aspirin when started on apixaban 
(last admission).

# Gastroesophageal reflux disease: continued home PPI

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
#ERROR!
[ ] Daily standing weights
[ ] PET/lung malignancy workup
[ ] Central vs. mixed sleep apnea work-up (needs Sleep Lab 
evaluation)

Greater than 30 minutes was spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.
