Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 4:26 ___ 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 5:01 ___ 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Status post VP shunt catheter placement.  Previously seen 
ventricular 
dilatation has nearly resolved..  No new intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage or 
territorial infarct. 
2. Status post suboccipital craniectomy with interval decrease 
in the 
extracranial fluid collection now measuring up to 5.2 cm, 
previously 8 cm, 
consistent with pseudomeningocele. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 3:15 ___ 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter in stable position 
with interval 
decrease in right lateral ventricle size.  Right ventricle is 
slit-like, 
clinically correlate for over shunting.  Tiny focus 
intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage along the lower margin of catheter tract.  Near

stenosis or

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female who is s/p chiari 
decompression ___. She presented to the ED for complaints of 
headache, nausea, vomiting and was found to have a fluid 
collection at the surgical site. The collection was tapped and 
CSF culture was sent to the lab. The patient was admitted to the 
___ and was scheduled to undergo VPS placement on ___. 

# Hydrocephalus: Patient underwent right VP shunt placement on 
___, 120cc was aspirated from occipital collection. Her 
operative course was uncomplicated and she was extubated in the 
OR. A ___ Strata valve was placed and set at 1.0. She 
returned to the ___ post-operatively. Patient complained of LUE 
numbness and decreased dexterity in L hand. CT showed a very 
small area of hemorrhage in the thalamus along the catheter and 
was otherwise stable. Her symptoms improved and she was full 
strength in her L hand. She was transferred to the floor. An MRI 
___ was obtained and the shunt was adjusted back to 1.0 
after her imaging. She was discharged in stable condition with 
follow-up with Dr. ___ in 1 month with a NCHCT. 

#Urinary retention: Patient required straight cath x1 
post-operatively for acute urinary retention. She voided without 
difficulty the remained her of her hospital stay. She was 
started on Cipro for bacteria in her urine. This was d/c'd on 
discharge at the patient was asymptomatic and the UA was 
negative.

with drainage of a pseudomeningocele. Your incision should be 
kept dry until sutures are removed.
_x0095_Your shunt is a ___ Strata Valve which is programmable. 
This will need to be readjusted after all MRIs or exposure to 
large magnets.  Your shunt is programmed to 1.0.  . 
_x0095_Please keep your incision dry until your sutures are removed. 
_x0095_You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
