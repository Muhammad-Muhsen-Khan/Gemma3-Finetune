Brief Hospital Course:
This is the complicated case of a ___ year old single Latino man, 
___ 
speaking only, with reported history of depression, one prior 
suicide attempt, longstanding history of impulsivity and  
behavioral dysregulation beginning in childhood, who presented 
to ___ via EMS from ___ in the setting  
of intentional overdose on a beta blocker and Xanax as well as a 

self inflicted laceration to his wrist. 
. 
Interview with Mr. ___ was notably limited, as he tended 
to minimize his presentation throughout his psychiatric 
hospitalization, but significant for him apparently being in his 
usual state of health until his "girlfriend" broke up with him, 
causing significant distress with resultant impulsive suicide 
attempt as noted above. Collateral from his sisters, ___ and 
___ was concerning for a longstanding neurodevelopmental 
process beginning in childhood with longstanding history of 
aggressive behaviors with assaultive behaviors towards teachers 
in the first grade, history of criminal behaviors with prior 
charges for homicide, stalking, violating a restraining order, 
resulting in numerous incarcerations. Of note, his sister 
___ reports his most recent relationship with his reported 
girlfriend was not romantic in nature but that Mr. ___ 
had reported to his sister he felt "betrayed" and that he wanted 
to shoot this woman; however, he currently does not have access 
to a gun (although has been in gangs in the past and could 
obtain one, per the sister's report, in ___. 
.
Diagnostically, nothing in history to suggest a prior history of 
manic symptoms including decreased need for sleep, increased 
energy, rapid speech. Nothing on my examination to suggest a 
major mood episode (he consistently denied depressive symptoms 
and serial mental status examinations notable for euthymic 
affect with some reactivity when he was told he could not leave 
the hospital when he wanted to. He consistently denied SI/HI, 
AVH, paranoia during his hospitalization, and his thought 
process was notably linear, goal and future oriented. Given this 
history, believe the etiology of his presentation was consistent 
with underlying neurodevelopmental disorder that renders him 
predisposed to chronic impulsivity and aggressive behaviors-- 
again, no evidence to suggest a current/prior major depressive 
episode, manic, or psychotic episode. 
.
#. Legal/Safety: Patient refused to sign a conditional voluntary 
agreement on admission so was admitted on a ___. On 
___, patient signed a conditional voluntary agreement 
(Section 10 & 11) and signed a 3-day notice on ___ which 
expired on ___. Given his consistent denial of suicidal 
ideation or thoughts of self-harm consistent denial of wanting 
to harm others, his ability to maintain adequate behavioral 
control on the unit with no unsafe behaviors it was felt that he 
did not meet criteria to file a 7&8b at that time and was deemed 
to be safe and stable for discharge home with his sister. Of 
note, he did not express any preoccupation with his 
"ex-girlfriend," stating he was "over it" and had moved on. For 
this reason, I did not notify his ex-roommate of his upcoming 
discharge, as he denied any desire or intent to harm her. 
.
#. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder as noted above: 
- Patient was encouraged to attend groups, but given the 
language barrier, he largely declined. He was compliant in 
meeting with his treatment team. 
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, risperidone was 
started and titrated to 2 mg BID for irritability which was 
later downtitrated to Risperdal 2 mg QHS due to patient 
complaint of feeling sedated during the day. He was also started 
on Cogentin 1 mg QHS for prevention of extrapyramidal side 
effects. 
- Given his history of aggression and impulsivity, we also 
discussed the risks and benefits of Depakote, which was titrated 
to Depakote 1500 mg XL nightly with good effect; Depakote on 
___ 66 by time of discharge. 
- Patient was compliant with medications and consistently denied 
suicidal ideation or thoughts of self harm, thoughts of wanting 
to harm others throughout his psychiatric hospitalization. By 
time of discharge he stated that he felt better and was 
motivated to leave the hospital, take his medications, and 
follow up with outpatient treaters. He also was in agreement 
with plan for referral to partial hospital program to continue 
working on coping skills and ability to tolerate rejection. Plan 
was for him to return home with his sister, who felt comfortable 
with the above discharge plan. 
.
#. L wrist laceration

scale, but after the above medications were started, patient's 
fingersticks were well-controlled in low 100s 
- Patient continued on metformin 500 mg BID and glipizide 5 mg 
daily on discharge 
.
#. HTN
- Patient's blood pressure was noted to be low throughout the 
hospitalization, likely secondary to improved diet while in the
