IMAGING:

CXR ___: Impression - No areas of focal consolidation to 
suggest pulmonary edema.

TTE ___: Impression - No pericardial effusion. Normal 
biventricular cavity sizes, regional/global systolic function. 

Hand Xray ___:
Left hand: There has been previous amputation of the long finger 
at the base of the proximal phalanx.  This is unchanged.  
Fracture involving the distal phalanx of the index finger 
appears mostly healed.  There is acro-osteolysis of the index 
and small fingers.  There are vascular calcifications.  Surgical 
clips are seen adjacent to the distal radius.  Peripheral IV 
catheter is seen. There are mild-to-moderate degenerative 
changes of the first CMC joint.  No bony erosions are present. 
  
Right hand : No acute fractures or dislocations are seen.  
Vascular 
calcifications are seen.  There is acro-osteolysis particularly 
of the index finger. There are no erosions. 

Foot xray ___
  
There is extensive demineralization which limits evaluation.  
Patient 
undergone transmetatarsal amputation.  No definite cortical 
destruction is 
seen to indicate acute osteomyelitis however again the 
osteopenia markedly 
limits evaluation.  Extensive vascular calcifications throughout 
the soft 
tissues.  These findings have markedly progressed since 
essentially normal 
radiographs from ___
