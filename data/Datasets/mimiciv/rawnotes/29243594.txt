with associated narrowing of the airway. 

CXR ___
Tracheostomy tube is present with tip ___ a midline position

loss favoring atelectasis although coexisting aspiration and or

ACTIVE ISSUES
#ERROR!
# Right cricoid cartilage fracture, likely right arytenoid 
dislocation and resultant subglottic stenosis: Patient with 
known subglottic stenosis, vocal cord edema, and inversion of 
the cricothyroid cartilage causing airway narrowing and stridor, 
likely due to traumatic intubation/extubation ___ ___. 
He has presented to care multiple times and has failed 
outpatient treatment with a prolonged oral steroid course. Upon 
arrival to the ICU, he was acutely stridorous and underwent 
emergent intubation and bedside tracheotomy on ___. Patient 
initially intubated successfully by anesthesia using 6.0 tube. 
Bronchoscopy showed significant mucus plugging on left side, 
however unable to suction ___ small tube size. He was started on 
IV Dexamethasone 12mg q6hrs and gradually tapered by no more 
than 20% daily. He was discharged to rehab on a dexamethasone 
taper, liquid formulation given through his Dobhoff. He was 
evaluated by both ENT and ACS. He is to have the tracheotomy 
tube downsized 10 days after placement (around ___ once the 
original tract matures. ACS did not want to change out the trach 
while he was inpatient and deferred this to respiratory therapy 
at the rehabilitation facility. He was set up with ENT as an 
outpatient to discuss the different surgical possibilities for 
his airway and to discuss timing of and tracheotomy reversal. 

# Bradycardia. While ___ the ICU after his tracheotomy procedure, 
he was noted to have asymptomatic bradycardia to 40-50s on 
telemetry. EKG was sinus bradycardia. It was thought there may 
have been a component on vagal stimulation during his 
tracetomoty to cause his new bradycardia.  

# Nutrition. He was evaluated by speech and swallow during 
admission. Given the size of the tracheotomy and persistent 
airway edema he was unable to be fit for a speaking valve. Per 
the policy of the inpatient speech and swallow team he was 
unable to be tested trialing POs given that he did not have a 
speaking value ___ place and was a new tracheotomy patient. He 
was started on tube feeds with plan to repeat speech and swallow 
evaluation at rehab following downsizing of the tracheostomy and 
placement of a speaking value, with eventual transition back to 
POs.   

# N. meningitidis ___ sputum culture. ID and infection control 
consulted on ___ given moderate growth of neiserria 
meningitides. ID and Infection control were both consulted. This 
likely represented colonization given no indication of active 
infection (no e/o PNA, no systemic signs of infection). ID did 
not recommend eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage ___ this 
patient at this time. Per infection control at ___, the 
patient did not need to be on droplet precautions or isolation 
even with his trach ___ place.

# Leukocytosis: This was thought likely reactive ___ the setting 
of steroids. He was influenza negative, and respiratory culture 
showed commensal flora and Neisseria colonization, without w/o 
evidence of infection on CXR. He was afebrile without other 
identifiable sources of infection.
