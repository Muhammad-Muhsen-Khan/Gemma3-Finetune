Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Penicillins / Robitussin A-C / Clindamycin / Lipitor / latex / 
phenylpropanolamine hcl
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Fall, altered mental status
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ w/ hx AF not on coumadin, cervical ca s/p TAH/BSO, 
rheumatic heart disease w/ moderate MR, HTN, and hx L ICA clot 
and resultant persistent R hemiparesis, c/b edema s/p L 
frontotemporal craniotomy in ___ and subsequent swelling 
resulting in repeat cranioplasty ___ (AVM rupture vs occlusion 
with conversion), aphasic since cranioplasty, currently living 
at rehab, presents after apparent fall. She was unattended in 
her room when staff heard chair alarm, and found her on the 
floor in front of her chair, awake and mentating at baseline. 
She has difficulty relating complaints at baseline, as well as 
unable to relate circumstances of fall.

In the ED, initial vitals were: T97.7 HR80 BP117/85 RR18 
O2Sat97% RA  
-Labs were notable for:  WBC 12.4, hgb/hct 14.6/44.3, plt 255, 
Ca 9.9, Mg 1.9, P 4.2, Trop < 0.01, BUN/Cr ___, INR 1.0
-Imaging: CT Cspine: ___ acute fracture, moderate degenerative 
changes at c4-c5; CT head showed ___ acute intracranial 
abnormality, showed right frontal scalp and periorbital 
hematoma, possible sinusitis
-Patient was very agitated in the ED, off baseline per family. 
Exam: On exam conscious and alert, non-verbal but tracks others 
in room, large R periorbital ecchymosis/swelling without 
evidence of ocular trauma or EOM entrapment, ___ other facial 
injuries appreciated; has hypertonia/contractures on R side at 
baseline
-Patient was given: 10 mg IM olanzapine   

On the floor, she was asleep but arousable. History was 
predominantly given by daughter and son at bedside. She had an 
unwitnessed fall, and a history of recent falls. In discussing 
with her outpatient care facilities and nurses, it appears that 
she has had several falls recently. Two falls occurred when she 
was in her wheelchair and became unsteady, falling to the right. 
There was an attempt to provide her with a heavier wheelchair 
for stability control, which was somewhat helpful per her 
daughter. However, her most recent fall occurred in the heavier 
wheelchair, when she became unbalanced and fell to the right 
again. Per the nursing staff at her living facility, she does 
intermittently become agitated. Additionally, on further history 
taking it appears that patient at baseline is AAOx0-1, and is 
only somewhat interactive with caregivers.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ hx AF not on coumadin, cervical cancer 
s/p TAH/BSO, rheumatic heart disease w/ moderate MR, HTN, and hx 
L ICA clot and resultant persistent R hemiparesis, c/b edema s/p 
craniotomy and cranioplasty with persistent aphasia who 
presented after fall from her rehab facility.

# s/p fall: Residual R front and periorbital hematoma, ___ sign 
of fracture. Patient with known hypertonia/contractures on R 
side at baseline, likely contributed to fall.  Per report from 
living facility, patient has had ~3 falls over past month 
usually in setting of attempting to get up from chair (i.e. two 
falls occurred with wheelchair tipping over).  Most recent fall 
occurred after being placed in chair.  Fall was likely 
mechanical in nature.  ECHO ___ with normal EF, moderate MR, 
ruling out valvular pathology as etiology.  Patient had head CTs 
x2 per neurosurgery recs to eval for bleed and delayed bleed due 
to higher risk (on lovenox).  Both non-con head CT scans were 
negative for intracranial bleed.  Trauma eval including CT neck, 
cxr and hand xray were negative for any acute fracture.  Patient 
was discharged back to prior living facility, and the facility 
was advised to provide more close monitoring of patient to help 
prevent future falls. Patient was set up with outpatient 
follow-up with Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ 
(___).  

# AMS: There was also a question of agitation and altered mental 
status on arrival to the ER.  Regarding the question of altered 
mental status, patient was AAOx0-1. She was at her baseline 
during her hospitalization per discussion with family and her 
rehab facility. An infectious workup including CBC, UA, and CXR 
were negative. Her urine culture was pending at the time of 
discharge, but had been ___ growth to date. Per the nursing staff 
at her living facility, she does intermittently become agitated 
which was noted in the ER, but is not different that her 
baseline. THe patient is on Nuedexta and sertraline at her 
facility.  Nuedexta is non-formulary, thus this was not given 
while inpatient. However patient did receive olanzapine 5mg x1 
for agitation. At the time of discharge, she was calm and did 
not have any agitation episodes. 

# Afib: Chronic history of Afib with CHADVASC score of 4. 
Patient is not on anticoagulation as she had as declined it in 
the past. EKG showed atrial fibrillation in ___.  Patient was 
continued on home metoprolol and amiodarone. Please consider 
discussing anticoagulation with patient during follow-up 
appointment as she is at high risk for thromboembolic events. 

# Hx L ICA Stroke: persistent R hemiplegia. Stable.  CT Head x2 
negative for acute intracranial bleed as noted above.  Patient 
has f/u scheduled with neurosurgery and neurology.

# Nutrition: PEG In place, c/d/I. Patient was continued on bolus 
feeds per nutrition recs.

# HTN: continued home metoprolol.

=============================================================
Transitional Issues:
[] Recommend close monitoring of patient given falls: likely 
mechanical in nature. Patient will benefit from more careful 
monitoring in the rehab facility. She will follow-up with Dr. 
___ and Dr. ___ in the 
outpatient setting.  
[] Continue to monitor mental status. She was at baseline per 
discussion with family and living facility staff (somewhat 
interactive with family, aphasic, AAOx0-1, intermittent 
agitation) during her admission to ___.  She was continued on 
home sertraline.  Nuedexta which is an outpatient medication was 
not continued as this is non-formulary.  She did receive 
olanzapine 5mg x1 for agitation.  Could consider starting 
olanzapine prn if clinically indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted to the hospital after you 
experienced a fall and confusion. Due to your fall,  there were 
multiple imaging studies of your body done to rule out any 
fractures or head bleeds. You had a right forehead and eye 
bruise, but otherwise the studies did not show any intracranial 
bleeding, fractures, or evidence of infection. The cause of your 
fall is likely related to some chronic imbalance from your prior 
stroke.  Our team has spoken with your living facility regarding 
keeping you near providers to help reduce the risk of future 
falls. Please be sure to be cautious when you are moving in the 
future to avoid any more falls. 

You were seen by the neurosurgery team while you were here, who 
discussed your case with your neurosurgeon Dr. ___. At 
their recommendation, a second CT scan of your head was obtained 
which was again negative for any bleeding. You will follow-up 
with Dr. ___ in the outpatient setting. 

Please continue to take all your medications as prescribed, and 
follow-up with your doctors at the ___ below.

It was a pleasure to care for you during this hospitalization.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
