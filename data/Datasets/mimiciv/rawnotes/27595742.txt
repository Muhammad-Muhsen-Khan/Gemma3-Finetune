___:  AP pelvis:

Exam is underpenetrated due to patient body habitus and 
overlying soft tissue. Given this, no definite acute fracture is 
seen.  Patient is status post left hip arthroplasty with 
prosthesis partially imaged.  Prosthesis is in anatomic 
alignment.  Mild right hip degenerative changes are seen.  There 
are also degenerative changes along the partially imaged lower 
lumbar spine. 

___:  chest x-ray:

The left costo-phrenic angle and the very inferior left 
hemi-thorax are not 
included on the image.  Given this, no definite focal 
consolidation.  Mild 
cardiomegaly and possible slight prominence of the main 
pulmonary artery may relate to underlying pulmonary 
hypertension.  No definite acute fracture seen. 
If there is high clinical concern for acute fracture in the 
chest, CT is more sensitive 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female admitted to the hospital after she sustained 
a fall striking her face on a metal chair resulting in a right 
open globe fracture and right orbit fracture. The patient was 
initially seen at an OSH and transferred here for medical 
management.  Because of her injury, the Ophthalmology and 
plastic surgery service were consulted.  She underwent cat scan 
imaging of the head which showed a deflated globe with likely 
VH. The patient was taken to the operating room where she 
underwent exploration and partial repair of large corneo-scleral 
laceration with re-positing of uveal tissue, finding of 
additional posterior scleral lacerations in zone
III, and conjunctival closure.

The operative course was stable and the patient was extubated 
after the procedure.  The patient was administered four doses of 
Vancomycin and Ceftazadin following the procedure.

Her post-operative course was stable. She was placed on sinus 
precautions with a right eye shield.  Antibiotic ointment was 
applied twice daily.   She resumed a regular diet and  was 
voiding without difficulty.  Her pain was controlled with oral 
analgesia.  24 hours after surgery, she had a follow-up visit 
with Ophthalmology. In preparation for discharge, the patient 
was evaluated by physical therapy and met with the social 
worker. Recommendations were made for discharge to a 
rehabilitation facility to help the patient regain her balance.  
   

The patient was discharged on HD #5 in stable condition. 
Appointments for follow-up were made with the Ophthalomology 
service and with her primary care provider.  Discharge 
instructions, including the need for sinus precautions, were 
reviewed.  

Of note:  patient has not resumed actos and metformin, may 
resume at rehab, monitor blood sugar

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a fall at home in which 
you sustained a fracture to the right bony socket of your eye.

were taken to the operating room for closure of the sac covering 
of the eye. You have since had follow-up appointments within the 
hospital.

 SINUS PRECAUTIONS

Because of the close relationship between the upper back teeth 
and the sinus, a communication between the sinus and the mouth 
sometimes results from surgery. This condition has occurred in 
your case, which often heals slowly and with difficulty. Certain 
precautions will assist healing and we ask that you faithfully 
follow these instructions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even 
though your sinus may feel _x0093_stuffy_x0094_ or there may be some nasal 
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If 
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew 
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water 
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not 
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our 
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if 
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all 
future appointments until this condition has resolved

additional instructions:

You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.

*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.

*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.

*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, 
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid 
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.

*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.

*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your

within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is 
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or 
back.
