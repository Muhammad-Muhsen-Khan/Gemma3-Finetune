Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a PMH of IDDM, 
gastroparesis, celiac disease, s/p gastric bypass ___, 
hypothyroidism, anxiety, fibromyalgia, bipolar disorder, and IBS 
who was referred by her PCP for DKA in the setting of recent 
tooth infection, initially found to be hypotensive, was admitted 
to the MICU and was briefly on pressors. DKA resolved with 
insulin administration, also underwent tooth extraction of teeth 
4, 16, 20, and 31 by OMFS given non-restorable severely decayed 
teeth. She also started on a 10 day course of augmentin for 
odontogenic infection which was thought to be the trigger of her 
DKA.

# DM Type I
# DKA - Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes, was found to 
have persistently elevated blood sugars. Prior to admission she 
had been taking antibiotics for a broken tooth and abscess in 
the outpatient setting. On admission found to be in DKA with 
anion gap 27. DKA protocol was initiated, and anion gap closed 
___ and was later transitioned to SC insulin. Trigger for DKA 
was thought to be secondary to odontogenic infection per below. 
___ was consulted for insulin titration. During hospital 
course, there were ongoing issues with hypoglycemia, patient was 
discharged on Lantus 4 units QAM 2 units QPM, and switched to 
regular insulin 2 units TID with meals given her high risk of 
hypoglycemia.

# Odontogenic Infection - Patient was recently diagnosed with 
tooth infection in the outpatient setting, was on amoxicillin, 
however ran out of her supply prior to admission. ___ was 
consulted regarding need for tooth extraction. Panorex was 
obtained which showed poor dentition with multiple necrotic 
teeth and root tips. Given concern for follow-up with outpatient 
dentist and high risk of repeat DKA in the setting of 
non-restorable severely decayed teeth, patient underwent 
extraction of the teeth 4, 16, 20, 31. She was initially on 
unasyn, however subsequently transitioned to augmentin for a 
total 10 day course to be completed ___. Was discharged on 
short course of tramadol for pain control.

# Hypotension - In the ED, patient had hypotension and 
aggressive fluid resuscitation for DKA. She was briefly started 
on levophed and was quickly weaned off. She was observed in the 
MICU with stable SBPs in the ___. Hypotension was possibly 
in the setting of hypovolemia from DKA. Lower suspicion for 
septic shock, given patient remained afebrile without 
leukocytosis.
