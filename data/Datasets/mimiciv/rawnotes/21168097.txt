IMAGING
TTE

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant 
valvular disease seen (adequate-quality study). Normal global 
and regional biventricular systolic function. 

In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations 
on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis. 

TEE
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage.
The left atrial appendage ejection velocity is normal. No 
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. There is 
no evidence for an atrial septal defect by
2D/color Doppler. Global systolic function is normal (LVEF 
greater than 55%). The right ventricle has
normal free wall motion. There are simple atheroma in the aortic 
arch and simple atheroma in the descending
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened
with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the mitral valve. No abscess is
seen. There is physiologic mitral regurgitation. No 
masses/vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve.
No abscess is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. No mass/vegetation are seen
on the tricuspid valve No abscess is seen. There is physiologic 
tricuspid regurgitation.

___ OPINION MRI L SPINE
1. Enhancing STIR hyperintense abnormal marrow signal centered 
along the left
L5-S1 facet with some involvement of the left L4-L5 facets.  
There is hazy
enhancement of the L5-S1 facet, with mild encroachment on the 
left lateral
aspect of the epidural space and subarticular zone, contacting 
the left
traversing S1 nerve root and extending to the left S1-S2 
epidural space. 
Associated enhancing left paraspinal muscle STIR hyperintense 
signal spanning
L3-L4 through L5-S1 is identified.
2. There is no definite clumping or enhancement of the cauda 
equina, however
the traversing left S1 nerve root does appear to demonstrate 
enhancement.
3. The constellation of findings is highly suspicious for septic 
arthritis
centered in the left L5-S1 facet joint with paraspinal myositis 
given history
of bacteremia.  Differential consideration of prominent 
degenerative changes
is considered less likely given the degree of enhancement and 
surrounding
inflammatory changes.
4. There is a small 6 mm cystic component arising from the left 
L5-S1 facet
along the dorsal epidural space, likely representing a synovial 
cyst and/or
microabscess.

CXR PICC PLACEMENT
IMPRESSION: 
 
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Satisfactory positioning 
of a
right-sided PICC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female w/ h/o HTN, diastolic CHF, 
and recent admission (___) to ___ for MSSA 
bacteremia who is transferred to ___ for fever and 
transaminitis, attributed to drug reaction from CTX and found to 
discitis/septic arthritis of the L5-S1 facet joint on MRI 
L-spine.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#ERROR!

#MSSA Bacteremia
#L5-S1 septic arthritis/discitis : Recent discharge for MSSA
bacteremia, treated with CTX with no clear source found. Patient
presented with recurrent fevers and low back with MRI L-spine 
showing hyperenhancement of L5-S1 facet joint c/f 
discitis/septic
arthritis, confirmed on second read here. CRP elevated 136. ESR
29. Deferversced on vancomycin and discontinuation of CTX (it 
was suspected that fevers may have also been due to drug 
reaction from CTX, in addition to discitis/septic arthritis).
TTE/TEE without any evidence of IE or abscesses. Plan for an
extend course of vancomycin (avoiding pencillins/cephalosporins 
given below) for treatment of underlying joint infection for an 
additional ___ weeks from ___ (end of 4 week course of MSSA 
bacteremia). 

# Transaminitis: Patient presents with new transaminitis without
any concerning findings on RUQUS. Likely related to drug 
reaction
to ceftriaxone and cross reactivity with zosyn. Hepatitis 
serologies negative at ___. Now downtrending with 
discontinuation of Zosyn. Will need repeat within 1 week.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were transferred to ___ from ___ with fevers and 
abnormal liver tests. We think this was due to the antibiotics

antibiotics for additional ___ weeks. We switched your 
antibiotics and your liver enzymes improved. It is now safe for 
you to go home.
