History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of DLBCL on
R-CHOP, ESRD on HD (MWF), diastolic heart failure, and newly
diagnosed atrial fibrillation (on rate control, not on
anticoagulation ___ recent GI bleed) who presents with dyspnea 
on
exertion, anemia, and weakness.

The patient presented to ___ clinic morning of admission 
for
___ cycle R-CHOP. He has been doing poorly with more weakness 
and
feeling drained since ___ after HD. He uses a walker at
baseline but was unable to get up a single step to his second
floor bedroom due to severe weakness in his arms and legs. He
called the police who came to his ___ and carried him up the
stairs to his bedroom. He spent the weekend on the second floor.
On ___ he had his ___ and ___ visit who noted him to be very
weak while using the walker and called a chair car to bring him
to dialysis. However, this arrived too late and he missed his HD
appointment that day. He instead went for dialysis on ___ 
and
___ which were uneventful and he completed both sessions.
He has ordered a hospital bed for the first floor but it has not
arrived yet. He also notes dyspnea on exertion. He continues to
feel progressively weak and unable to walk more than a few steps
with the walker. He notes mild cough that he feels is from post
nasal drip and allergies. He notes he has lower extremity edema
which is improved after his ___ started using compression
stockings. He believes he is close to his dry weight which he
thinks is about 121kg. He makes a very small amount of urine 
each
day.

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 97.1 86 151/71 18 96%
2L. Labs were notable for WBC 9.9, H/H 6.9/21.9, Plt 196, INR
1.6, Na 130, K 6.7 (hemolyzed) -> 4.7 , BUN/Cr 33/5.0, glucose
249, Trop 0.34, and BNP >70k. CXR showed pulmonary vascular
congestion and no focal consolidation. Patient was given calcium
carbonate 500mg PO and sevelamer 1600mg PO. ___ Oncology (Dr.
___ was consulted who recommended no diuresis, no
transfusion, TTE, and admission to OMED. Atrius Cardiology was
consulted and unsure if saw patient/left recommendations. Prior
to transfer vitals were 98.2 87 130/73 18 96% 2L.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports weakness and 
generalized
fatigue. He notes occasional numbness in his fingers and toes. 
He
denies fevers/chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,
dizziness/lightheadedness, hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis,
hematochezia/melena, dysuria, hematuria, urinary/fecal

-Seasonal allergy. 
-History of pneumonia in ___ leading to ESRD in setting of

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- ___ by Dr ___ management of his newly
diagnosed B cell diffuse large cell lymphoma, dx'd by a core
biopsy 5 d ago of a large pelvic mass. He noted RLE swelling in
early ___. LENIs were negative for clot but did show an
enlarged groin node. The picture was felt to be from a prior
cellulitis of his foot and he was followed. His swelling
continued and repeat LENIs in early ___ showed suggestion of 
an
obstruction higher up and he underwent a CT of his abdomen and
pelvis that showed a large pelvic mass with splenomegaly and
mediastinal and portacaval adenopathy and lytic lesions in the
right pubic symphysis and inferior pubic ramus.  A subsequent 
PET
scan delineated those areas as well as moderate disease in his
chest. He underwent a core bx in ___ last week which showed B 
cell
diffuse large cell lymphoma, germinal center origin (better
prognosis) with a high proliferative index of 80-90%.
Cytogenetics showed bcl 6 rearrangement but no worrisome
mutations. Interestingly, his LDH is normal. He continues to 
have
RLE edema but denies any abdominal pain or pelvic pain. His wt 
is
stable. He denies any fevers, night sweats or pruritis. He has
multiple medical problems with DM since adolescence and has been
on dialysis for the past ___ years. He denies any cardiac disease
but did have mild dysfunction on a cardiac PET test a year ago.
He is complaining of left elbow pain, having fallen at dialysis
several days ago, striking his left elbow and leg. Xrays at the
___ were negative. Sent home without a sling or any advice. Exam
showed obesity, 3 fb splenomegaly, pain, swelling left elbow and
2+ RLE edema Labs: Hct 32, LDH- 171, protein elec-normal. Hep
serologies normal. 
A: Stage IIIA large cell lymphoma. High intermediate risk given
age, performance status and multiple sites of disease with CR
estimated at 56%, ___ year OS of 37%. Recommended Rit/CHOP chemo.
- ___: Started chemo with Rit/CHOP. Split dose Rituxan with 
50
mg/m2 given on day 1. The rest to be given day 6. Under mistaken
impression that he was to take his prednisone indefinitely so
stayed on it until subsequent GI bleed.
- ___/: Rituxan given.
- ___: Hosp FH for acute GI bleed. Upper endoscopy showed
duodenal ulcers. Missed chemo ___ due to miscommunication.
- ___: Hosp ___ for ___ cellulitis LLE and epistaxis. Also
had paroxysmal atrial fib.  
- ___: Cycle 2 Rit/CHOP given. Neulasta given on day 2.
Treatment delayed 2 wks due to gi bleed and LLE cellulitis.
- ___: CT showed near resolution of soft tissue masses in 
right iliopsoas and obturator internus muscles, persistence of 
splenomegaly and bone lytic lesions 
- ___: Resumed chemo with rituxin and bendamustine
- ___: Received day 2 of rituxin and bendamustine

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of DLBCL on R-CHOP, ESRD on HD 
(MWF), diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (not on 
anticoagulation ___ GI bleed with duodenal ulcers) admitted with 
weakness and dyspnea, found to have newly depressed EF to 30%. 

#Acute on chronic systolic HF: TTE on admission with newly 
depressed EF to 30% with global hypokinesis, concerning for 
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (although tachy-mediated 
cardiomyopathy also possible given new AF). Cardiology 
consulted, recommended continuing home meds irbesartan and 
metoprolol. Volume was managed with HD. He received adjusted 
chemotherapy due to concern for toxicity.
Discharge weight: 117 kg

# DLBCL: Stage IIIA large cell lymphoma, presented s/p C2 of 
R-CHOP. High-intermediate risk given age, performance status and 
multiple sites of disease with CR estimated at 56%, ___ year OS of 
37%. Unusually, pt's LDH was wnl, raising possibility of 
indolent lymphoma (e.g. in spleen, bone) transforming to 
high-grade lymphoma with masses in R iliopsoas and obturator 
internus. The patient received 2 days of rituxan/bendamustine on 
___ and ___. He received two doses of neupogen on ___ and ___ 
prior to discharge, with plan for Onc f/u on ___ to receive 
neulasta.

# ESRD on HD (MWF): Continue home sevelamer, calcitriol, and 
calcium carbonate. Patient received ultrafiltration for 
management of acute CHF, and continued with his regularly 
scheduled MWF dialysis. 

# Anemia of chronic disease with contribution of marrow 
suppression from chemo: Stable throughout admission.

# Atrial fibrillation: Continued home metoprolol for rate 
control. Not on anticoagulation due to past GIB.

# CAD: Continued on home metop and atorva. 

# IDDM: Continued on lantus 20U BID at home + HISS.

# HTN: Continued on home irbesartan, metop

# Hx GOUT: Continued on home allopurinol

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were recently admitted to the hospital after experiencing 
shortness of breath and weakness. While you were here, you were 
diagnosed with worsening heart failure, likely due to one of the 
chemotherapy medications. 

The heart failure was treated with medication as well as by 
removing fluid from your body through hemodialysis. You were 
also started on a new chemotherapy regimen for your lymphoma 
that is now complete.

It has been a pleasure taking care of you. 

Sincerely, 
Your ___ care team
