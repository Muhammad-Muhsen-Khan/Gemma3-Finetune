IMAGING
-------
Small bowel follow through:
IMPRESSION:  
Barium passes quickly into the small bowel within 25 min due to 
limited amount of remaining small bowel, all of which has a 
jejunal fold pattern, which with the short length of small bowel 
likely reflects that the entire ileum has been resected.  No 
fistula identified. 

MICROBIOLOGY
------------
   CYCLOSPORA STAIN (Final ___:    NO CYCLOSPORA SEEN. 

   MICROSPORIDIA STAIN (Preliminary):

      NO CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OR GIARDIA SEEN.

      NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN. 
      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium, 
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected 
by routine

despite outpatient IVF daily hydration.

# Acute renal failure on Chronic Kidney disease:
Baseline creatinine in the ___ range with episodes of 
elevation to 3.0.  The patient was given IV fluids with 
improvement in her creatinine to 2.6. The patient was seen by 
nephrology who discussed with the patient's outpatient 
nephrologist. SPEP was sent and showed only 
hypogammaglobulinemia. The patient likely has underlying CKD 
with changes in her renal function related to volume status. She 
was advised to continue to measure her urine output and to have 
repeat urine studies as an outpatient. 

# Diarrhea: To date has been attributed to small bowel resection 
and SIBO. Longstanding, refractory to supportive outpatient 
care, based on rising Cr appears unable to maintain adequate 
intake even with frequent IVF boluses via port. The patient was 
followed by gastroenterology. Stool studies were checked which 
were negative. She had a ttG which was normal. Upper GI series 
with small bowel follow through showed rapid movement of barium 
into the small bowel confirming short gut syndrome. The 
patient's diarrhea improved during her hospitalization. She was 
advised to take creon- open the capusles 15 minutes before 
meals. She was also advised to cook with MCT oil and to use 
liquid loperamide to help control her diarrhea as an outpatient. 
She will follow up with Dr. ___ discharge.

# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW, confirmed on repeat check. 
Supports diagnosis of progressive CKD. H/H was stable throughtou 
hospitalization. 

# Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis: In  setting of chronic 
diarrhea, on sodium bicarb supplementation at home which was 
continued.

#Thyroid studies
Patient noted to have THS of 9.8 with T4 of 3.7 and T3 of 70. 
Advised to discuss these results with her PCP or endocrinologist

# Neuropathy:
- Continue home neuropathy

# Mild Alzheimer's disease:
- Continue home donepezil - recently started
- Continue home folic acid
