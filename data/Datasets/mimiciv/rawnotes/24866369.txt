Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ man with right amaurosis 
fugax admitted to the ___ on 
___. Ultrasound and CTA had previously revealed a right 
internal carotid artery stenosis in the setting of prior right 
neck dissection and neck irradiation for skin cancer.  The 
risks, benefits and alternatives to right carotid artery 
stenting were explained to the patient in
detail and he consented to proceed.

The patient was taken to the endovascular suite and underwent 
right carotid artery stenting of the right internal carotid. For 
details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative 
note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit 
in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was 
transferred to the vascular surgery floor where he remained 
through the rest of the hospitalization. 

Post-operatively, he developed oozing from the R groin access 
site which resolved with held pressure. The gauze remained dry 
thereafter. He continued his daily ASA and Plavix. He was able 
to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and ambulate without 
assistance, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral 
medications alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was 
given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions.
