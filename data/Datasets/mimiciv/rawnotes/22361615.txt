130-140s). He held evening dose of labetolol and then reports 
developing substernal chest pain at around 10pm. ___ in 
severity described as dull pressure with radiation to both 
shoulders and arm. Reports nausea/vomiting x 1 with nonbloody,

Studies
-------------------
___ TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferoseptal and 
inferior walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining 
segments (LVEF = 45-50 %). Doppler parameters are indeterminate 
for left ventricular diastolic function. The number of aortic 
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets 
are moderately thickened. The degree of aortic valve stenosis 
could not be quantified. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild regional/global dysfunction c/w CAD. Aortic stenosis 
(unable to be quantified) and mild aortic regurgitation. Mild 
mitral regurgitation.  

Cardiac Cath ___
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
The LMCA had distal 80% into origin Cx which has 90% stenosis 
with origin OM 60% and 70% stenosis in the mid protion of the 
vessel. The origin LAD has 70% stenosis and the mid portion has 
90% stenosis followed by and aneurysmal segment at the diagonal. 
The diagonal had mid vessel 40% stenosis.
The RCA was moderately calcified with proximal 30% stenosis and 
mid vessel 80% sgenosis and distal 80% before the bifurcation 
with origin PL 60% stenosis and distal 60% un a small upper 
pole.

Impressions:
1. Severe left main and three vessel disease.
.

TEE ___
Conclusions   
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen 
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous 
echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left 
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular 
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The right 
ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. There are 
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple 
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the 
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve 
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened and 
calcified. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 
1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a fibrinous 
mass on the tip of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. Dr. ___ was notified in person 
of the results in the operating room at the time of the study.

 POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced and is receiving 
epinephrine by IV infusion.
 1. Normal bi-ventricular systolic function
 2. There is a tri-leaflet bio-prosthesis in the aortic 
position. Well seated and stable with good leaflet excursion. 
There is no aortic regurgitation.
 3. Due to inability to align Doppler beam the post-CPB 
gradients could not be obtained. However there is adequate 
leqflet opening and no stenosis.
 4. Intact aorta and no other change

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with hx of CLL, HTN, and diabetes 
mellitus, hemorrhagic CVA who is presenting with substernal 
chest pain found to have ECG changes and troponin up to 1.21 
concerning for NSTEMI s/p cath with diffuse 3 vessel disease now 
awaiting cardiac surgery

# CORONARIES: diffuse 3 vessel disease; LMCA 80% sentosis into 
Cx which has 90% and 70% in mid portion of vessel. RCA 
mid-vessel 80% stenosis. 
# PUMP: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild 
regional/global dysfunction c/w CAD. Aortic stenosis (unable to 
be quantified) LVEF 45-50%
# RHYTHM: NSR 

#)NSTEMI: Patient with multiple risk factors including diabetes 
mellitus and hypertension now presenting with substernal chest 
pain found to have STD in V4-V6 concerning for lateral NSTEMI. 
Troponins peaked at 1.21. Currently chest pain free. now s/p 
cath showing difufuse 3 vessel disease, no intervention 
performed. Patient continued on aspirin 81mg po daily, 
olmesartan 40mg po daily, rosuvastatin 40mg qhs. Given diffuse 
vessel disease patient was evaluated by cardiac surgery and 
deemed an appropriate candidate.

#) Hypertension: Hypertensive in the ED up to 190/110s. On 
amlodipine, furosemide, olmesartan and home labetolol regimen. 
Home amlodipine increased from 5mg to 10mg po daily, and 
continued home furosemide 20mg po daily, labetolol 400mg q8am, 
600mg q5pm, 600mg q12am, home olmesartan 40mg po daily.

#) Diabetes Mellitus: At home on metformin 500mg po daily. Held 
metformin while inpatient and controlled blood sugars with ISS.

#) Hx of hemorrhagic stroke: Per patient report the patient had 
two hemorrhagic strokes with the first in ___, and the second 
after that although unclear on time course. Given his risk of 
bleed, Neurology consulted in regards to giving heparin in the 
setting of NSTEMI. Given location of prior bleed most consistent 
with hypertensive bleed. MRI/MRA with encephalomalacia with 
chronic appearing blood products. Evaluated by neurology and 
given no evidence of re-bleeding in the
past ___ years, it would be reasonable to use a heparin gtt for 
systemic anticoagulation as it would provide significant cardiac 
benefit. 

#) Recent oral surgery:  completed 10 day course of Amoxicillin 
500 mg PO Q8H (D1 ___

#) Anxiety/depression: Continued on home risperidone, buspar, 
oxazepam.
#) CLL: admitted with leukocytosis to 20. Appears to be 
baseline. 
#) Constipation: Continue home docusate and senna

















#ERROR!
CARDIAC SURGERY COURSE:

The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent CABG x 3 and AVR (tissue) with Dr. ___. 
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
 POD 1 found the patient extubated and breathing comfortably.  
He required restraints for agitation on POD 1.  He was treated 
with Amiodarone for brief AFib.  AFib did recur- however, given 
his history of head bleed, it was decided to not start Coumadin. 
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically 
stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently 
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Free air was noted 
under diaphragm on CXR.  ACS consulted and believed 
pneumoperitoneum to be a result of chest tubes or surgery- no 
compromise to bowel. Abdominal exam remained benign. Diet was 
advanced as tolerated.  
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. 
Leukocytosis developed and he was treated for UTI.  
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended adjustments in 
medication. 
 By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was 
deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  He is oriented x ___ffect and 
minimal verbal communication. 
The patient was discharged to ___ in ___ in good 
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Expected length of stay at rehab is less than 30 days.
