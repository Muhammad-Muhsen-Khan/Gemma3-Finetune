IMAGING/STUDIES:
#ERROR!
CXR ___ IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

MRI LIVER ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. Interval improvement of multiple hepatic micro abscesses 
throughout the 
liver, main the left hepatic lobe. 
2. However, there has been continued interval increase in size 
of a right 
hepatic lobe (segment 6) multiloculated abscess measuring 3.4 
cm. 
3. Unchanged mild central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation 
with mural enhancement consistent with cholangitis. 
4. Unchanged pancreatic tail collection. 
5. Postsurgical changes related to ___'s procedure. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  The right hepatic lobe abscess may be 
amenable for 
drainage.  Consider ultrasound feasibility scan. 

CT ITNERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. Successful CT-guided placement of an ___ pigtail 
catheter into the 
right hepatic collection.  Of note, fluid could not be aspirated 
likely due to phlegmonous nature rather than an organized fluid 
collection. 
2. Trace postprocedure perihepatic hemorrhage.  Continued 
clinical follow-up is recommended. 

CT ABD/PELVIS ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 
2. Grossly stable appearance of the liver abscess, status post 
pigtail 
catheter placement.  This is somewhat difficult to assess in the 
absence of contrast. 
3. Multiple peritoneal metastatic nodules as described above, 
less conspicuous on today's exam due to lack of intravenous 
contrast. 

TTE ___ CONCLUSION: The left atrium is normal in size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Normal left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global 
systolic function (biplane LVEF = 61%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on 
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal 
image quality. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but 
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular wall thickness, cavity size, 
and regional/global systolic function. No valvular abnormalities 
or pathologic flow identified. No echocardiographic evidence of 
endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal 
echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.  

CT INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE ___ IMPRESSION:  
An approximately 5.5 cm hypoechoic and hypodense collection 
within the right hepatic lobe was targeted for aspiration or 
drainage.  This was determined to be solid during attempted 
sampling, likely representing phlegmon in the setting of known 
infection.  A previously placed pigtail catheter was removed 
without placement of a new catheter into the collection. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  4 week followup CT or MRI is recommended to 
ensure 
resolution or improvement. 

TEE ___ IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or 
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. No thrombus/mass is seen in the right atrium or right 
atrial appendage. The right atial appendage ejection velocity is 
normal. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 
2D/color Doppler. Global systolic function is normal (LVEF 
greater than 55%). The right ventricle has normal free wall 
motion. There are no aortic arch atheroma and no atheroma in the 
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. No abscess is seen. There is no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. 
No abscess is seen. There is physiologic mitral regurgitation. 
No masses/vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No 
mass/vegetation are seen on
the tricuspid valve No abscess is seen. There is mild [1+] 
tricuspid regurgitation.

CXR ___ IMPRESSION:
Left PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are clear.  No 
pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted with fevers and a positive blood culture. We 
believed that this infection may have been due to the abscesses 
in the liver.  We put in a drain to try to drain this area, but 
there was not much fluid to be drained and we removed the drain. 
 We also checked your heart with an echocardiogram and did not 
see any infection there either.  

Please take your medications and keep your follow-up 
appointments as listed below.  

It was a pleasure taking of you, 

-Your ___ Team
