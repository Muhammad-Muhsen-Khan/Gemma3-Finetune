Compared to prior, there has been interval evolution of 
bilateral mixed 
density subdural hematomas.  The overall size and extent of 
these collections has not significantly changed given 
differences in imaging technique.  For example, the hyperdense 
component along the inferior right frontal lobe convexity 
measures approximately 15 mm in greatest width (Series 3, image 
23), unchanged from prior.  There remains local mass effect on 
adjacent sulci with minimal midline shift to the right.  The 
basal cisterns are patent.  No new hemorrhage is identified.  
There is no evidence of infarction.  Chronic left temporal 
lacune is again seen. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  There is mucosal thickening 
of the right greater than left maxillary sinus, including high 
density material in the right.  Remainder of the paranasal 
sinuses are clear.  The visualized portion of the orbits are 
unremarkable.
