concerning for recurrent bowel obstruction

The patient had a recent admission in ___ following 
cholangiogram/PTC exchange on ___. He was subsequently found 
to have several days of diarrhea and abd pain, and eventually

removal)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man w/ metastatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p 
multiple biliary stents c/b SBOs who presented with worsening 
abdominal pain and distention found to have a recurrence of 
malignant SBO. He was seen by surgery and given his extensive 
carcinomatosis, he was determined not to be a surgical 
candidate. He was treated conservatively with NGT placed to 
suction. A PICC was placed and he was started on TPN for 
nutrition. A J tube was placed for decompression by ___ on ___ 
which was complicated by post-procedural hypotension. He was 
given IVF x 4 L with persistent hypotension to ___. KUB was 
concerning for bowel perforation given presence of free air out 
of proportion to what would be expected post-procedure. Given 
his worsening clinical status, he was initially made DNR/DNI 
after discussion with the patient but after discussing further 
with his family this was reversed to full code. He was 
transferred to the ICU for persistent hypotension requiring 
pressors. While there he was treated empirically for septic 
shock with IV LR x 1L, vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole for 
broad coverage including anaerobes given potential biliary 
source. Micafungin was added given sepsis and increased risk for 
fungal infection with TPN. A RLL consolidation was seen on CT 
with R basilar crackles although he had no significant 
respiratory symptoms. CT also confirmed presence of perforated 
hollow viscous. The patient was seen by surgery who did not 
recommend surgical intervention. A family meeting was held with 
a ___ interpreter and his oncologist, Dr. ___, to 
explain the grim prognosis and he was switched to comfort 
measures on ___. The patient was subsequently transferred to 
medicine service ___ to pursue inpatient hospice given his 
precarious situation. Initially on a PCA, he was switched to a 
morphine drip by ___. He died comfortably around 2am on ___ 
with family at bedside.
