___ F with history of GERD, depression, recent heavy EtOH use, 
presenting with worsening epigastric pain on ___, found to 
have acute choledocholithasis and likely gallstone pancreatitis. 
Labs notable for total bilirubin elevated at 4.8 and lipase of 
2280. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed gallstones, 
gallbladder wall thickening, and common bile duct measurement of 
1.7 cm and intrahepatic biliary dilation. She was stable from a 
cardiopulmonary standpoint. The patient was admitted to medicine 
for ERCP with plan for laparoscopic cholecystectomy once lipase 
normalized.

On HD2 the patient underwent ERCP. Occlusion cholangiogram 
showed several stones within the cystic duct and gallbladder. 
Common bile duct was dilated approximately 15mm in diameter with 
multiple filling defects. A sphincterotomy was preformed and a 
___ Fr x 5 cm Advanix double pigtail stent was placed across the 
ampulla due to extensive stone burden. Post procedure abdominal 
pain resolved. Repeat labs showed total bilirubin decreased to 
1.8 and lipase decreased to 190. 
On HD3 informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken

# Epigastric abdominal pain
# Choledocholithaisis
# Likely gallstone pancreatitis
Pt noted to have significantly elevated LFT's and lipase on 
admission at ___ with dilated CBD on RUQ US.  Most likely 
obstruction rather than significant EtOH intake responsible for 
lab abnormalities.  Pt with mild temp on arrival but denies 
fevers/chills at home and no other e/o cholangitis at this time.
--Keep NPO at current time
--ERCP in AM
--Tylenol and prn IV morphine for pain control
--Hold off on abx at current time as pt stable and currently 
afebrile.  Would start Zosyn vs. Cipro/flagyl if pt spikes 
another temp and/or becomes otherwise unstable
--Pt also likely needs ACS consult for ?ccy this admission

# EtOH abuse
Pt reports recent binge drinking after death in family but 
denies history of chronic drinking or w/d symptoms in the past.
--Monitor on ___ q4H for now, ___ MD to order benzos if needed

# Depression-- Continue home fluoxetine

# GERD-- Continue home PPI

# OA-- holding home Celebrex given possible ERCP today

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ with abdominal pain and found to have 
an infection in your gallbladder and gallstones causing and 
obstruction of bile flow. You were initially admitted to the 
medical service and underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy to clear 
the stones and placement of a stent due to the amount of stones 
found. Your labs were closely monitored after the procedure and 
showed the bile was clearing. You then underwent surgery and had 
your gallbladder removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the 
procedure well and are now ready to be discharged to home to 
continue your recovery.

Please note the following discharge instructions:

ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.

You will need to return for a repeat ERCP in 2 to 4 weeks (scope 
with camera down your mouth) to remove stents that were placed 
there on your last ERCP.
