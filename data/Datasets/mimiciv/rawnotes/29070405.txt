History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ man with a previous hospitalization for SI, PTSD, 
and an unclear mood disorder who brings himself to the ED for 
"racing thoughts, disorganization, and lack of motivation" 
attributed to his stress around his general chemistry course.
. 
Upon initial interview in the ED with Dr. ___, patient 
was extremely disorganized, making loose associations, had a 
flight of ideas, and with pressured speech. He began with an 
attempt to compensate for his thought process through a "2 
sentence summary" and proceeded to speak on the following 
topics. On his illness: He acknowledges that he has a mental 
illness and is actively seeking help: "I feel like I finally 
have options with the medical resources available". Willing to 
pay the money to get another "neuropsychological test" and 
treatment. In regards to his mother, Mr. ___ feels that 
his mother manipulates him. He's become paranoid that she is 
attempting to dismiss (or hide) his mental illness by telling 
others he's doing fine and a "straight A student". He has 
therefore been collecting collateral by "talking to everyone to 
make it clear I'm unhealthy" so that his
mother won't manipulate him anymore. He needs this evidence 
before he "talks to a lawyer against his mother". He was 
particularly hurt when he was labeled as dependent on his mother 
and has been working to "prove he exists outside of his mother". 
He also feels he manipulated her boss (her fiancé) to marry her. 
Patient went on to report e is very suspicious of his mother's 
fiancé and lists reasons why his mother ___ be with him 
such as "his first wife committed suicide" and "he married his 
second wife who was already married to his friend". He also 
describes him as manipulate around his business practices in 
___. Patient went onto state that he's very upset at his 
father and lists a long list of reasons. He also mentions he 
believes his father has schizophrenia but won't take treatment. 
. 
In regards to his psychiatrist, patient stated he has been 
seeing Dr. ___ most of his time at ___. He has tremendous 
trust in her and asks us to have any medications approved by 
her. He has also done extensive research into her. Searching for 
her on PubMed and finding her on Facebook. He discovered that 
she's married and has children which really upset him because he 
has stated that he never wants to get married and hates kids and 
will never have kids. He also feel horrible for taking up so 
much of her time because "he knows she
has many other patients. 30patients. Including geriatric 
patients. I want geriatric patients to get help too". Mr. 
___ stated he's been doing a lot of research on 
psychiatric diseases. He states "there are other children" who 
are suffering. He has also done "research to prevent stress".
. 
Patient reported that at school, this is his second attempt at 
general chemistry (first attempt led to his first admission). He 
states he wasn't able to study for his chemistry exam and says 
he "can't read like this" because he's unable to concentrate ___ 
"racing thoughts, disorganization, and lack of motivation". He 
attempted to increase his focus by dropping his only other 
course at ___--a masculinity course--but is still doing poorly in 
chemistry. He
then explains why he likes chemistry and begins making loose 
associations between water and the ozone layer. He recently 
emailed the ___ president asking for "a pro-rated tuition" given 
this will be his second year without meaningful progress. 
. 
Sleep: He states that he only had 3 hours of sleep yesterday and 
5hours the night before. He says he "hates falling asleep" 
because of auditory hallucinations in which he hears "things not 
following noun and verb agreements". He endorses he has 
previously been diagnosed with hypnopompic hallucinations. 
. 
In regards to safety, patient reported he is "no longer 
suicidal". "Dr. ___ me realize I ___ be". He also 
endorses feeling there he is of "no use on this earth" and 
expressed an interest to donate all of his organs and die. He 
states he "doesn't want to hurt people" and "is not evil" He 
decided to come into the ED and seek help after calling his 
"mother's fiancé's accountant's oncologist" while he was at a 
meeting in ___ who convinced him to report to the ED. 
. 
Collateral from outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. ___: Patient has 
not had prior manic episode, but has had ___ day periods 
concerning for hypomania in the past, patient has contacted her 
multiple times in recent days, and she was very
concerned for acute mania and agrees that is the most likely 
diagnosis. In agreement with olanzapine treatment now, and with 
inpatient hospitalization."
.  
ED course: patient was in adequate behavioral control and did 
not require physical or chemical restraints. 
. 
Upon admission interview, which was limited due to significant 
disorganization, patient states that he came to the hospital 
because he "couldn't take gen chem."  He reports stress with his 
mother, and state that he was talking on the phone with her for 
hours, and so missed many hours of class. He asks, "am I still 
manic?" He is worried about returning to classes this fall. He 
discusses the ex-wife of his mother's boss, and that she is 
being "blamed." He states that he hopes to talk with a social 
worker about talking with his mother. 
. 
He announces to the team that he has realized that "suicide is 
not an option." He states that he never believed in mortality, 
then learned that humans are mortal. He states that he was 
"fantasizing" about donating his kidneys, heart, and pancreas so 
he would die and also be doing something charitable. He says 
that if he remained alive, his mother could continue to 
"manipulate" him, but if he died, his mother won't "go mad." 
. 
He states that in ___ he thought about committing suicide 
by taking buproprion and ativan. He thought about overdosing, 
duct taping his hands, then going into the river. He says that

he wouldn't do it." He expresses that he is glad that he is in

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ single Caucasian man, currently an undergraduate at 
___, history of mood disorder s/p one prior 
psychiatric hospitalization at ___ in ___ for 
depression and SI, thalassemia minor, who self presented to 
___ ED for "racing thoughts, disorganization, and lack of 
motivation" with subsequent admission to ___ due to 
concerns for psychosis. 
. 
Initial examinations were notable for patient being extremely 
disorganized with looseness of associations, flight of ideas, 
pressured speech, with paranoia that his mother as attempting to 
dismiss his mental illness, resulting him in attempting to 
collect collateral by "talking to everyone to make it clear I'm 
unhealthy" so that his mother will not manipulate him anymore. 
Further history notable for apparent rapid decompensation after 
recently visiting his mother in ___ with subsequent 
decreased need for sleep, auditory hallucinations, significant 
anxiety, racing thoughts. Mental status examination notable for 
anxious appearing individual with rapid, pressured speech, 
flight of ideas, disorganized thought process, significant 
preoccupation with his mother and her engagement with her long 
time boyfriend. Patient has also been spending excessive amounts 
of money, including on $500 headphones, which he threw away 
after a few uses; patient also admitted to spending $100,000 in 
the past year on clothes and other items. Patient also endorsed 
suicidal ideation, stating he wants to donate his organs so he 
can die while doing something charitable. 
.
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is not quite clear, 
although I do believe the patient meets criteria for mania with 
psychotic features at this time. I am concerned for an 
underlying neurodevelopmental/neurocognitive process as well, 
and I would recommend consideration of neuropsych testing when 
he has been stabilized more fully. Given his young age and 
possible family history of mental illness, a primary psychotic 
disorder remains on the differential at this time. Nothing in 
his medical history that would suggest an underlying medical 
condition is contributing to his current presentation. Patient 
denies drug use and tox screen was negative on admission-- I do 
not believe his presentation is secondary to substance use. 
.
#. Legal/Safety: patient admitted to ___ on a ___, upon admission he signed a conditional voluntary form, which 
was accepted. He maintained his safety throughout his 
hospitalization on 15 minute checks and did not require physical 
or chemical restraints. 
. 
#. Mania: as noted above 
- Patient was compliant in attending groups, where he 
participated appropriately. 
- Given good response, patient was initially continued on 
Zyprexa. However, given concern for weight gain, after 
discussion of the risks and benefits, we converted to Geodon 
which was titrated to 60 mg po bid. He tolerated this well 
without complaints of side effects. 
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, we also initiated 
lithium, initially at 450 mg po bid. Lithium level on this dose= 
0.3 mg and so this was increased to 600 mg po daily and 900 mg 
po qhs. Recommend recheck of trough level on ___. 
- For insomnia and anxiety, patient was started on Ativan 
titrated to 2 mg po qhs for insomnia and 1 mg po daily prn 
anxiety. He tolerated this well with improvement in his sleep 
and anxiety-- recommendation is to taper this off as tolerated 
and as clinically indicated
- In the setting of the stabilizing environment and initiation 
of the above medications, patient's condition improved. Although 
he continued to be intermittently anxious, he reported feeling 
better, denying depression, suicidal ideation, thoughts of self 
harm, AVH, paranoia throughout his hospitalization. Thought 
process was notably linear, goal and future oriented by time of 
discharge and he was amenable to following up with a partial 
program
- A family meeting was held with Mr. ___ mother, who 
came from ___ to support her son. We discussed the 
hospital course, treatment recommendations and  discharge 
planning, and his mother was supportive of the plan
- Prior to discharge, I also called Dr. ___ outpatient 
psychiatrist who agreed with the above assessment and plan. 
.
#. Medical: no acute medical issues during this hospitalization
