sct_id,label,entry,reasoning
217975004,Accident caused by woodworking or forming machine (event),Trauma report: woodworking or forming machine accident listed as external cause,"The trauma report identifies an accident caused by a woodworking or forming machine and treats it as the external cause, which matches this event concept. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 217975004 is the most precise match because it denotes accidents due to woodworking/forming machines. A broader parent such as “External cause of injury (event)” or “Machinery accident” would lack specificity. Child concepts that specify particular machines or occupational context are not justified by the text. Sibling concepts for other machinery types are inappropriate. The documentation style does not alter the coded concept."
301438001,Ability to mobilize (observable entity),Ability to mobilize reviewed,"Stating that the ability was reviewed provides context of documentation without changing the underlying observable. The core concept is the patient's capacity to mobilize, an Observable entity, precisely SCTID 301438001. No modality, severity, or cause is specified, so narrower or abnormal sibling concepts do not apply. The parent concept of general ability is less specific than mobilization."
223758003,Peninsular Malaysia (geographic location),Mainland Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia),"The entry presents ‘Mainland Malaysia’ and clarifies it as Peninsular Malaysia, treating both as equivalent references to the same geographic area. SNOMED CT category: Geographical location (Location). Exact code: SCTID 223758003. This does not represent the parent ‘Malaysia’ nor the sibling ‘East Malaysia,’ and it does not denote the broader Malay Peninsula. The parenthetical ensures equivalence without adding clinical attributes."
708110000,Treated water specimen (specimen),Specimen label reads: treated water,"The label specifies the specimen as treated water, with no additional attributes such as source or method. The core concept is a specimen within the SNOMED CT Specimen category. The correct code is Treated water specimen (708110000). Parent concepts like ‘water specimen’ do not include the treatment qualifier, and siblings that add details (e.g., drinking water, chlorinated water) are not indicated by the entry."
411885008,"Daphnia, fish feed specific diagnostic allergen extract (product)",Daphnia fish feed diagnostic test allergen extract,"This phrase denotes a diagnostic test allergen extract and specifies the source as Daphnia fish feed, which accurately reflects SNOMED CT concept 411885008. The category is Product—specific diagnostic allergen extract. The wording does not introduce procedural results or therapeutic usage, so it remains aligned with the product concept. Mapping to a more general parent would lose source specificity, and siblings for different allergens or non-diagnostic products would be wrong. The “diagnostic test” wording is a safe synonym for specific diagnostic use."
765073001,Product containing prostaglandin analog (product),Pharmaceutical product containing a prostaglandin analog,"Here the main concept is a pharmaceutical product with a prostaglandin analog as an ingredient class. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product (Product). The mention of 'pharmaceutical product' and 'containing a prostaglandin analog' exactly matches SNOMED 765073001 without specifying form, route, strength, or a particular analog. Parent concepts like general pharmaceutical product are too broad, and child concepts that name specific analogs or dosage forms are not supported by the text. It does not refer to the substance class alone, so substance-level codes would be incorrect; the product-level code is the precise match."
785338002,Product containing serotonin uptake inhibitor (product),Serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication,"The main concept is a medicinal product whose pharmacologic action is serotonin reuptake inhibition. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). The wording specifies the product class without naming a specific ingredient, dose form, or route and does not add selectivity or additional mechanisms, so Product containing serotonin uptake inhibitor (785338002) is the most precise match. More general parent product classes are too broad, and child or sibling concepts such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) products or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) products would be too specific and are not indicated by the entry. The phrasing “serotonin reuptake inhibitor” is a clinically accepted synonym for “serotonin uptake inhibitor,” maintaining equivalence without changing the code selection."
1204482000,Island in region of Turks and Caicos Islands (geographic location),Unspecified island in Turks and Caicos Islands,"The entry signals that the island is within Turks and Caicos Islands but not further identified, which matches the generic island-in-region concept (SCTID: 1204482000). The main concept is purely geographic, and 'unspecified' simply reflects the lack of naming without changing the underlying location. Category: Geographic location. Choosing the broader regional concept would omit the island characteristic, and selecting a specific island concept would add detail not present here. Siblings outside the Turks and Caicos are not appropriate due to the explicit region."
121822007,Octanoylcarnitine measurement (procedure),Acylcarnitine C8 level measurement,"By naming acylcarnitine C8, this entry focuses on octanoylcarnitine. “Level measurement” denotes the Procedure. It is best coded to Octanoylcarnitine measurement (121822007), not to a general acylcarnitine measurement (parent) or other chain lengths (siblings). No extra attributes are introduced."
258485006,Corneal scraping specimen (specimen),Corneal scrapings specimen,"The plural 'scrapings' in the phrase still denotes a specimen derived by scraping the cornea, a clinically equivalent wording. This is a Specimen concept and matches SNOMED CT 258485006 precisely. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts like conjunctival scrapings specimen or corneal swab specimen would change site or method. The plural form does not add attributes; it remains uniquely codable to corneal scraping specimen."
450586006,Curettage of neoplasm of bone (procedure),Curettage undertaken for bone tumor,"The text reflects the undertaking of a curettage procedure for a bone tumor, which directly identifies the same operative action. This matches SNOMED CT Curettage of neoplasm of bone (procedure), SCTID 450586006. No additional qualifiers (e.g., malignancy status, site, laterality, adjuvants) are included. Therefore, broader parent procedures without the neoplasm context or different-action siblings (excision/resection) are less suitable."
59301000119108,History of prostate needle biopsy with negative result (situation),Patient confirms a prior negative result from a prostate needle biopsy.,"This patient statement affirms a historical prostate needle biopsy with a negative result. The main concept is a situation involving a past procedure and its outcome. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The most precise code is 'History of prostate needle biopsy with negative result' since it captures both the procedure (needle biopsy of the prostate) and the negative outcome in a historical context. Parent concepts that are generic or lack the outcome, and siblings with positive outcomes, would be less accurate. The wording remains a clinically equivalent paraphrase without extra attributes."
255705009,Macore dust (substance),Diagnostic report reference: Macore dust,"Within a diagnostic report context, the term “Macore dust” is cited as a reference, but no attributes like presence, causation, or timing are asserted. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Substance category and specifically SCTID 255705009. Using a broader parent code for dust or a finding/disorder code would be less appropriate because the entry conveys only the substance name, not an observation or clinical condition."
465797008,Atmospheric-pressure assistive measuring aid (physical object),Patient carries an assistive atmospheric pressure monitor,"The statement notes the patient carries an assistive monitor that measures atmospheric pressure. Main concept: assistive measuring aid for ambient air pressure. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The device description matches SCTID 465797008; the carrying context does not alter the object type. Parent concepts are not specific enough, and siblings like standard barometers lack the assistive qualifier. 'Monitor' here is equivalent to 'measuring aid' and maintains codability to the exact concept."
411657009,Cheese mold diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergen extract for diagnostics: cheese mold,"This is a generic product description narrowed by the allergen source 'cheese mold' and the diagnostic use, which corresponds to Cheese mold diagnostic allergen extract (411657009). SNOMED CT category: Product. It avoids parent concepts lacking source specificity, and does not add child-level attributes such as concentration, route, or brand naming."
425357006,Genus Histrionicus (organism),"Histrionicus, taxonomic genus designation","The entry declares Histrionicus as a taxonomic genus, which is an organism concept. The SNOMED CT code Genus Histrionicus (425357006) is the exact match because the wording confines the reference to the genus level. No species or common names are given, preventing misclassification to child concepts, and it does not generalize to higher taxa. The descriptor 'taxonomic genus designation' is a synonymic paraphrase ensuring the rank is genus, not changing the code intended. Therefore, this precisely fits the genus organism concept."
216323008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, private home (environment)",ED triage documented: accident/poisoning occurred at home.,"This statement sets the place of occurrence for an accident or poisoning as the home, which is equivalent to private home in SNOMED. It represents an Environment or geographical location concept, aligning with SCTID 216323008. It does not add event type details (e.g., fall) or specific rooms (e.g., kitchen) that would map to child concepts. Parent concepts would be less specific, and siblings like public street or institution are excluded by the wording. “Home” here is a clinically accepted synonym for private residence/home and does not change the code selection."
85082007,"Lympholysis, function (observable entity)",Research endpoint: lympholysis function,"Here, lympholysis function is designated as a research endpoint, still describing the observable concept. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This maps to SCTID 85082007 since the endpoint refers to the functional property of lympholysis, not to a disorder or a procedural action. Parents such as general lysis endpoints and siblings like hemolysis endpoints are excluded. No additional attributes or results are stated."
866034009,Acute phase serum specimen (specimen),Acute-phase serum sample accessioned,"The phrase indicates that a serum sample from the acute phase has been accessioned, which keeps the focus on the specimen and its phase. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. Accessioning is a workflow status and does not introduce clinical attributes. Coding to a general “Serum specimen” would omit the acute-phase qualifier, and coding to siblings like convalescent-phase would be incorrect. “Sample” is a clinically safe synonym for “specimen,” preserving equivalence."
223393007,New Caledonia (geographic location),Home country: New Caledonia,"The entry lists New Caledonia as a home country, but the codable entity is the location itself. This aligns with SNOMED CT Location (Geographic location). The label does not change the geographic identity or imply a different level in the hierarchy. No parent region or child locality is introduced, so SCTID 223393007 remains the exact code."
111059006,Swamp (environment),Swamp terrain,"“Swamp terrain” describes the environmental terrain as swamp, without extra qualifiers such as event or subtype. The main concept is a terrain type in the environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This corresponds to Swamp (environment) [111059006]. Using Wetland would be too broad, and Marsh/Bog are not specified. No child subtype details are present, so the general swamp environment code is appropriate."
1306633008,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with full smile and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Orthodontic records include an extraoral 45° right hemiface photograph showing full smile with jaws in centric relation,"This context statement identifies the artifact as part of records, specifying extraoral photographic capture of the right hemiface at 45 degrees, with a full smile and centric relation jaw position. It is a Record artifact. Broader photographic codes or those for different angles/laterality/occlusion would be less specific. No additional attributes are introduced, supporting SCTID 1306633008."
118356003,Metal vapor laser device (physical object),Metal vapor laser device noted in operative report,"Within an operative report, the identifiable concept remains the Physical object: a metal vapor laser device. This cleanly maps to SNOMED CT 'Metal vapor laser device' (SCTID 118356003). The operative context does not imply a specialized laser type or a different category; it simply documents the presence of the device. Parent categories lack the medium detail, and specific metal children are not indicated, making the chosen code the most accurate."
430654003,Nocardia higoensis (organism),Organism name: Nocardia higoensis,"The phrase indicates the organism’s proper name, Nocardia higoensis, without implying any clinical findings or conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact code is Nocardia higoensis (organism) 430654003. Parents and siblings would not capture the specific species named here. The contextual words 'Organism name' simply frame the taxonomy and do not alter coding."
706061002,Apheresis system column (physical object),Apheresis system column,"The entry explicitly names the device component as an apheresis system column, which is a physical object integral to an apheresis setup. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This wording precisely matches SCTID 706061002 because it identifies the column component within an apheresis system, not the entire machine, nor a generic column unrelated to apheresis. More general parents like “Medical device component” or a generic “Column (physical object)” are too broad, and children such as specific modality columns (e.g., LDL or immunoadsorption types) are too narrow and not stated here. No additional attributes (type, function, brand) are introduced, keeping the code selection exact."
465101007,Sterile cold therapy pack (physical object),Inventory entry — sterile cold therapy pack,"Within inventory context, the item is a sterile cold therapy pack. Attributes present: sterility and device type (therapy pack). SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). This aligns exactly with SCTID 465101007. The inventory context is metadata and does not introduce procedural or clinical attributes. Parent terms that omit sterility are too general, and siblings like ice bags or non-sterile packs fail to meet the sterile specification. The wording maintains focus on the object, not its application."
1179676000,Structure of fourth subcostal muscle (body structure),Anatomy of the fourth subcostal muscle,"The entry focuses on the anatomy of the fourth subcostal muscle, which corresponds to a Body structure rather than a disorder or procedure. No extra attributes are present. The ordinal identification aligns precisely with SCTID 1179676000. A parent concept lacking the ordinal would be less specific, and any sibling with a different ordinal would not match. 'Anatomy of' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase for 'structure of' and preserves the same anatomical target."
761871008,International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form score (observable entity),ICIQ-UI SF score in chart,"This indicates the presence of the ICIQ-UI Short Form score within the clinical chart, maintaining the focus on the score as the observable entity. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity; SCTID 761871008 corresponds precisely to the ICIQ-UI SF score. The phrase “in chart” is documentation context and does not introduce attributes such as value or timing. It is not a parent ICIQ score or a different ICIQ module’s score, and it does not imply administration as a procedure. Accordingly, it uniquely maps to the specified score observable."
445645002,Report by source format (record artifact),Structure: report by source format,"This entry labels the document structure as 'report by source format.' The main concept is the structural format of the report, and the attribute is organization by source. It belongs to the Record artifact category and maps precisely to the named SNOMED concept. More general structure or document artifacts are less specific, and alternate organizing structures (problem-based, author-based) are excluded by the explicit 'by source' tag."
167708006,Cerebrospinal fluid appearance: blood-stained (finding),CSF described as blood-tinged,"The phrase documents a CSF appearance finding using “blood-tinged” as a synonym for blood-stained. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. SCTID 167708006 is the precise match since the core element is blood-stained CSF appearance. More general parent concepts or different sibling appearances do not fit. There are no added attributes such as severity, timing, or cause, so it remains a pure appearance finding rather than implying a different concept."
15009009,Meprylcaine (substance),Meprylcaine noted in medication dictionary,"A medication dictionary entry naming 'meprylcaine' refers to the substance itself without specifying a particular formulated product. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Meprylcaine (substance), SCTID 15009009, is the best match. The absence of strength, route, or salt form avoids product or salt-specific codes, and general anesthetic classes would be less precise than the exact substance."
366422000,Finding of passive range of thoracic spine right rotation (finding),Passive ROM finding: T-spine right rotation.,"The entry is a concise documentation of a passive range of motion finding involving right rotation of the thoracic spine (T-spine). It conveys passive modality, direction (right), and anatomical site (thoracic spine) without extraneous attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It directly corresponds to the specific concept of finding of passive range of thoracic spine right rotation. Parent concepts that generalize rotation or sibling concepts like left rotation or active ROM would be mis-specified. The abbreviation 'ROM' and shorthand 'T-spine' are clinically standard and equivalent."
59796008,Strophanthus kombé (organism),Taxonomic entry — Strophanthus kombe,"This denotes a taxonomic entry for Strophanthus kombe, directly referencing the species-level organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The context of taxonomy does not introduce clinical attributes; it simply names the taxon. A genus-level code would be too broad, and other species or subspecies are not implied by the wording."
425898006,Rebaudioside (substance),Rebaudioside chemical entity,"The phrase identifies rebaudioside as a chemical entity, which is semantically equivalent to the substance concept. Category: Substance. The best match is SCTID 425898006, as it denotes the non-isomer-specific rebaudioside substance. It does not imply products or adverse effects. Parent class terms or sibling specific isomers would be less appropriate given the generic naming."
6615001,Electroretinography (procedure),Electroretinogram (ERG) performed,"Although it references the electroretinogram, the phrase explicitly indicates a performed test, which denotes the procedure of electroretinography rather than a finding or result alone. This fits the Procedure category and maps to Electroretinography (procedure) 6615001. It does not specify a subtype such as full-field or pattern ERG, so child concepts would be inappropriate."
313277003,Adoption - birth history report (record artifact),Birth history report (adoption context),"This formulation conveys a birth history report specifically within the context of adoption, identifying the artifact type and its purpose. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 313277003 matches because it defines a birth history report tied to adoption. Parent concepts like “Record artifact” would be too general, and sibling entries such as “birth certificate” or “adoption summary” would not reflect the exact report type. The parenthetical clarifies context without introducing new attributes."
224633008,Apartment block (environment),Care plan environment: apartment block,"This entry specifies the environment in the care plan as an apartment block. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224633008 is the precise match because it names the specific building type. Selecting a parent (building) would be broad, and siblings (apartment complex, high-rise) would add scope or height attributes not mentioned. The care plan context merely situates the environment and does not modify the concept."
284772006,Front yard (environment),Yard in front of residence,"Main concept: a yard specifically located in front of a residence; attributes: positional descriptor “in front,” which defines the yard as the front yard. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This maps uniquely to Front yard (environment), SCTID 284772006, because the defining characteristic is the yard’s placement in front of the residence. Broader yard concepts are nonspecific, and opposite-placement siblings (e.g., back yard) or different features (e.g., garden) are excluded by the wording."
447357000,Specimen from breast obtained by aspiration (specimen),Aspiration specimen from breast,"This entry explicitly states a specimen derived via aspiration from the breast. The main medical concepts are source (breast) and collection method (aspiration), with the entity categorized as a Specimen. It matches SCTID 447357000. Parent concepts lacking method detail are less precise, and sibling concepts with different collection methods or additional attributes are excluded by the wording. The synonym 'aspiration specimen' is clinically equivalent to 'obtained by aspiration'."
1156212003,minute 1 (qualifier value),Timer value: 1 minute,"The entry presents a timer set to one minute, representing a quantified time value. The main concept is one minute as a Qualifier value. SNOMED CT minute 1 (qualifier value) [1156212003] is the accurate and most specific code. No other attributes (severity, cause, rate) are implied, and the unit remains minutes. A general minute unit parent is not specific enough, and siblings denoting other minute counts would be incorrect. The contextual label 'Timer value' does not change the underlying qualifier meaning."
464680004,Oxygen controller (physical object),Oxygen controller (physical object),"This entry repeats the fully specified device name and explicitly notes the Physical object category, introducing no extra attributes. It maps exactly to Oxygen controller (physical object) | SCTID: 464680004. Parent device concepts would be too general, and sibling terms like oxygen regulator, oxygen flowmeter, or oxygen blender imply functionality beyond control. The naming aligns perfectly with the SNOMED FSN, making it the most precise code."
470000005,"Extracorporeal ultrasound imaging system transducer, mounted (physical object)",Mounted extracorporeal ultrasound transducer,"The entry names a transducer used for ultrasound imaging that is both extracorporeal (external to the body) and mounted, matching the physical object specification. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This precisely aligns with 'Extracorporeal ultrasound imaging system transducer, mounted' (SCTID 470000005) because it captures the device type (ultrasound transducer), its placement (extracorporeal/external), and its mounting status. It excludes handheld or intracavitary probes (siblings/children) and avoids broader parent concepts like unspecified ultrasound transducer. The term 'transducer' is the standard synonym for 'probe' and does not change the code selection."
216900003,Foreign object left in body during infusion (event),Patient statement: 'something was left inside me during the infusion',"A patient-reported description still conveys the core event: a foreign object left in the body during infusion. The category remains Event, and the best match is SNOMED CT 216900003. Although phrased colloquially, 'something was left inside me' is a clinically acceptable paraphrase for foreign object retained. There are no details on object type or site, so more specific child codes are not supported, and broader procedural event codes lack the infusion detail present here."
397592007,Ability to detect odor (observable entity),Odor detection ability recorded,"The entry documents that the parameter “odor detection ability” was recorded, naming the observable without values. Category: Observable entity. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 397592007 because it refers to detection ability and not to different olfactory measures (threshold, identification) or to clinical findings/disorders. The documentation verb does not add attributes; it reflects use of this specific observable in the record, maintaining the precise match."
466492009,Wheelchair cushion (physical object),Wheelchair cushion documented,"The verb adds documentation context, but the subject is the physical object: a wheelchair cushion. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 466492009 is correct as the cushion is specific to wheelchairs. The entry avoids specifics like pressure-relief feature or materials, so child concepts are not indicated, and it is more specific than general cushions or wheelchair accessories."
301070009,Embolization of subclavian artery (procedure),Embolization of the subclavian artery,"Adding the definite article does not change the meaning: it denotes a procedure to embolize the subclavian artery. No extra attributes (laterality, indication, technique) are present. Category: Procedure. The precise SNOMED concept is Embolization of subclavian artery (301070009). More general parents lack vessel specificity, and any child specifying left/right or device technique would require details not provided. The synonym is clinically identical to the preferred term."
699373005,Exposure to asbestos (event),Noted asbestos exposure,"This denotes that asbestos exposure has been noted, indicating the occurrence of the exposure event without providing extra qualifiers. The concept type is Event, and the precise SNOMED CT code is Exposure to asbestos (event) [699373005]. More general parents would reduce specificity, and specialized children (e.g., occupational exposure) would add context not present. “Noted” is a documentation qualifier and does not change the underlying event."
672291000119107,History of carcinosarcoma of ovary (situation),Personal history of carcinosarcoma of the ovary.,"This entry indicates a personal past medical history of carcinosarcoma localized to the ovary. The concept is historical, not current disease. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It maps precisely to 672291000119107, which captures the historical context for ovarian carcinosarcoma. Using 'personal history' is a common clinical phrasing and does not broaden to the parent concept History of malignant neoplasm of ovary, because the histology 'carcinosarcoma' is specified. It is not the active disorder and does not add attributes like stage or treatment."
275014009,Soave endorectal pull-through operation for Hirschsprung's disease (procedure),Discharge summary: Soave endorectal pull-through for Hirschsprung disease,"This discharge summary line documents the specific procedure, namely the Soave endorectal pull-through, with the indication of Hirschsprung disease. Category: Procedure. SCTID 275014009 is the correct mapping because it captures the Soave technique for this condition. Parent concepts would be less specific, and siblings (Duhamel/Swenson) are excluded by the explicit Soave term. No attributes such as route modifications or staging are added beyond the base technique."
1003708009,Specimen from drain device (specimen),Drain device sample,"The entry denotes a sample (synonymous with specimen) and clearly identifies the source as a drain device. The concept is a specimen from a drain device, in the Specimen hierarchy. This matches SNOMED CT concept 1003708009. There is no introduction of attributes such as fluid type, anatomical location, specific device subtype, timing, or laterality, avoiding over- or under-specification. Parent concepts like “Specimen from device” are too general, and children such as “Specimen from wound drain device” would be too specific. Using “sample” does not alter the meaning or code selection."
711239005,Antigen of Candida albicans protein (substance),Candida albicans protein antigen material,"The phrase denotes the material as a protein antigen from Candida albicans, affirming organism and protein class alongside the antigen role. Category: Substance. This aligns with SCTID 711239005, Antigen of Candida albicans protein (substance). A broader Candida albicans antigen code would miss the protein specificity, and sibling concepts for other molecular types or allergen use would be incorrect. 'Material' is a neutral descriptor that does not imply product formulation or extra attributes."
815982007,Genus Pleurotus (organism),Pleurotus spp.,"Use of “spp.” denotes members of the genus Pleurotus when the exact species is unspecified, which is a standard genus-level reference in microbiological and taxonomic contexts. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This aligns with Genus Pleurotus (organism), SCTID 815982007, because it points to the genus as a whole. Parent concepts like Fungi are too broad, and child concepts naming specific Pleurotus species would be inappropriate given the unspecified species. The synonym “spp.” is clinically equivalent for genus-level identification."
1217606008,Pholcodine monohydrate (substance),Pholcodine monohydrate (active drug substance),"The parentheses clarify role but do not change the identity of the named chemical entity, pholcodine monohydrate. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 1217606008 is the correct code since the monohydrate is explicitly stated; broader “pholcodine” or different chemical forms (salts, anhydrous) would be less accurate. No product formulation, dose, or administration attributes are introduced by this phrasing."
65577000,"X-ray shield, device (physical object)",X-ray shield utilized,"Utilization is a context of use; the underlying concept remains an X-ray shield device, which fits SNOMED 65577000. There is no mention of device form, material, or target anatomy, avoiding child or sibling mappings. The wording is X-ray-specific and not general radiation protection, so parents would be less precise."
118337008,Coumarin C30 dye laser device (physical object),Coumarin C30 dye laser system,"The wording indicates a system-level device that is a dye laser using the Coumarin C30 dye, still a physical object. No usage or clinical detail is added. This belongs to the Physical object category and aligns with SCTID 118337008. More general parent concepts would lack the Coumarin C30 specification, and siblings enumerating other dye systems would be incorrect. 'System' is an accepted synonym for the complete device configuration and does not change the coded concept."
439341006,North Macedonia (geographic location),Place of service: North Macedonia,"The entry indicates that the place is North Macedonia, focusing on the country as a location value. The category is Geographic location. SCTID 439341006 is the correct, specific code for the sovereign state. Selecting a parent concept like Geographic location would be under-specified, and there is no mention of a more granular locale to warrant a child concept. The context (place of service) does not alter the underlying location concept."
361329009,Entire renal corpuscle (body structure),Kidney renal corpuscle,"This entry identifies the renal corpuscle within the kidney, referring to the complex of glomerulus plus Bowman’s capsule. Category: Body structure. The precise code is SNOMED CT 361329009 (Entire renal corpuscle). It does not assert any additional attributes. Mapping to nephron would be excessive (includes tubules), while mapping to glomerulus or Bowman’s capsule alone would be incomplete."
215191004,"Animal-drawn vehicle accident involving breakage of any part of vehicle, pedestrian injured (event)",External cause: pedestrian injured in animal-drawn vehicle accident involving breakage of vehicle part,"This states an external cause event where a pedestrian was injured in an accident with an animal-drawn vehicle and includes the key attribute that a vehicle part broke. The concept belongs to the SNOMED CT Event hierarchy and specifically maps to SCTID 215191004. More general accident codes without the breakage element would be less precise, and any variant implying a different injured party (e.g., driver) would be inappropriate. The wording “breakage of vehicle part” is a direct synonym for “breakage of any part of vehicle,” maintaining equivalence without adding new attributes."
279122008,Tiring (qualifier value),Fatiguing,"The synonym 'fatiguing' is clinically equivalent to 'tiring' when used as a descriptive quality. The SNOMED CT category here is Qualifier value, mapping to Tiring (qualifier value) SCTID 279122008. It does not state that the patient is fatigued; rather it labels something as 'fatiguing/tiring.' Therefore findings like Fatigue or Tiredness are not the right match. This synonym does not alter the code selection and remains aligned to the same qualifier concept."
1141644002,Oximetry catheter (physical object),Oximetry monitoring catheter,"The phrase specifies a catheter that supports oximetry monitoring, making it equivalent to an oximetry catheter. Category: Physical object (device). Oximetry catheter (SCTID 1141644002) fits best; broader catheter terms do not convey oximetry capability, and related devices such as pulse oximeters are not catheters. The wording does not introduce site, extent, or timing attributes."
439538003,Percutaneous aspiration of pelvis using computed tomography guidance (procedure),CT-guided percutaneous aspiration of pelvis,"This phrase includes the essential attributes: aspiration, pelvis, CT guidance, and percutaneous access. As a Procedure, it maps precisely to SCTID 439538003. Using only 'pelvic aspiration' would omit CT guidance, and specifying organ-level structures (e.g., ovarian) would move toward child concepts. The wording avoids other actions like drainage or biopsy, preventing misclassification to sibling procedures. It is a direct synonym of the stated concept without extra qualifiers."
184224005,Age-sex card record (record artifact),Age-sex card record updated,"The main concept is the age-sex card record; 'updated' is an administrative context without adding clinical attributes. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The wording corresponds directly to 184224005, while broader or sibling concepts like 'Demographic update' or 'Patient profile record' are not specific to the age-sex card format."
223880006,Greater London (geographic location),Named area: Greater London,"The entry simply indicates a named geographic area, Greater London. The concept is a place name; category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223880006 precisely matches the Greater London region. The wording does not suggest residence, travel, or event context, and thus does not shift to a situation or finding concept. It avoids broader parents and narrower children, maintaining unique codability to Greater London."
443311000124103,Lysine and tryptophan-free infant formula (product),Baby formula with no lysine or tryptophan,"Main concept: baby/infant formula in which lysine and tryptophan are absent. Attributes: infant formula; absence of both amino acids. SNOMED CT category: Product. This aligns exactly with Lysine and tryptophan-free infant formula (product), SCTID 443311000124103. Using “baby formula” is equivalent to “infant formula” and does not introduce new attributes. Parent concepts are nonspecific, and sibling concepts excluding only one amino acid are not appropriate."
1511004,Ejaculatory duct structure (body structure),Anatomical label: ejaculatory duct,"This denotes the ejaculatory duct as the anatomical label, which is the Body structure itself. It is accurately coded to Ejaculatory duct structure (SCTID 1511004). There are no attributes of laterality, pathology, or part-of detail. Parents (genitourinary structure) are too general, and children (e.g., lumen of ejaculatory duct) introduce specificity not present. Sibling structures like vas deferens or prostatic urethra are not mentioned. The labeling context is neutral and maintains the anatomical identity."
1156619000,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of esophagus at deep surgical margin in esophageal resection specimen (observable entity),Presence of primary esophageal cancer at deep surgical margin of the resection specimen,"This statement defines the observable entity that records the presence of primary esophageal cancer at the deep surgical margin in a resection specimen. The components are primary malignant neoplasm of esophagus (expressed as 'cancer'), deep surgical margin, and specimen context (resection specimen). This maps to SCTID 1156619000 in the Observable entity hierarchy. Alternatives representing outcomes (e.g., involved margin) or other margin locations would be incorrect for this wording, which conveys the presence-of variable itself without a value."
242296003,Accidental ingestion of scombroid fish (event),Ingested scombroid fish by accident,"This is a narrative phrasing of an unintentional ingestion event involving scombroid fish, without additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Event. It best fits SCTID 242296003 because it specifies both the accidental nature and the scombroid fish. Parent or sibling concepts related to intentional ingestion, exposure, or poisoning are not supported by the wording. The phrasing is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
469408003,Intravenous pole (physical object),Drip pole,"This refers to the pole used to suspend IV drip equipment, i.e., an intravenous pole. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. 'Drip pole' is a clinically acceptable synonym and does not alter the underlying object, so SCTID 469408003 is the correct code. Using a parent concept like generic pole would be insufficiently specific, and siblings like pump or hanger components would be incorrect. No additional attributes or features are specified, supporting direct mapping to Intravenous pole."
183557002,Referral to cardiothoracic surgeon (procedure),Cardiothoracic surgeon consult referral,"This entry denotes that a referral was made for a consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon, which remains a referral procedure to that surgeon, aligning with SCTID 183557002. The inclusion of ‘consult’ clarifies the typical purpose of a referral without altering the coded concept from referral to consultation. Parent concepts lack specialty specificity, and a sibling concept representing the consultation itself would be incorrect since the action is the referral."
258524009,Cervical swab (specimen),Gynecologic specimen: cervical swab,"This entry situates the specimen within a gynecologic context but specifically names it as a cervical swab, matching Cervical swab (specimen) SCTID 258524009. The main concept is a specimen with cervix as the source and swab as the type. SNOMED CT category: Specimen (Physical object). The gynecologic label is contextual and does not change attributes or imply tests or timing. It avoids mapping to broader parent categories and excludes sibling concepts such as vaginal swab or endocervical swab, keeping it precise."
404954008,Infant milestone: 4 months (observable entity),Milestones by age: 4 months (infant),"The entry points to the age-indexed infant milestone observable at 4 months, with age explicitly stated. This is an Observable entity. SCTID 404954008 is the precise match because it identifies the infant milestone for the four-month mark. Broader parent concepts omit age, and sibling codes tied to other ages or distinct skills would be inaccurate. The 'by age' phrasing indicates categorization without adding status or performance."
736401008,Chemotherapy care plan (record artifact),Chemo care plan,"The abbreviation 'chemo' is a common clinical shorthand for chemotherapy and, paired with 'care plan,' clearly denotes the recorded plan-of-care artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This best matches Chemotherapy care plan (record artifact), as it identifies a plan document specific to chemotherapy. Choosing a parent care plan concept would lose specificity, and selecting a chemotherapy procedure or regimen concept would incorrectly code an action or protocol rather than a plan document. The shorthand does not change meaning or add attributes."
54522000,Genus Anaerorhabdus (organism),Micro report organism: Anaerorhabdus (genus),"In a microbiology report context, the organism is named at the genus level—Anaerorhabdus—without species detail or clinical findings. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It corresponds to the Genus Anaerorhabdus concept (54522000). Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise, and species children are not indicated. No extra attributes are conveyed beyond taxonomy."
722160009,Audit trail report (record artifact),Audit trail report provided on request,"This describes provision on request, but the artifact named is an audit trail report. The main concept remains a report derived from the audit trail. Category: Record artifact. The most precise code is 722160009, as the term matches an audit trail report. Parent concepts such as generic report are not specific, and sibling concepts for audit trail/log without reports do not fit the entry."
415563002,Specimen from pancreas obtained by excisional biopsy (specimen),"Surgical specimen — pancreas, excisional biopsy","The phrase denotes a surgical specimen from the pancreas obtained via excisional biopsy. The main concept is a specimen, in the Specimen category. SCTID 415563002 is the best match because it reflects both the organ source and the excisional biopsy approach. It would be incorrect to select a parent concept lacking method detail or a sibling specifying needle/incisional biopsy. 'Surgical specimen' appropriately conveys the excisional technique without adding extra details."
20316001,Tertiary care hospital (environment),Chart lists tertiary care hospital as care setting,"This documentation note records the care setting as a tertiary care hospital, strictly identifying the environment without added attributes. It belongs to the Environment or geographical location category and maps to 'Tertiary care hospital (environment)' SCTID 20316001. The parent 'Hospital (environment)' would miss the tertiary specificity, and sibling concepts (e.g., 'Teaching hospital') are not implied. The phrasing is context-only and equivalent, so 20316001 is the precise match."
164735009,Fundoscopy abnormal (finding),Abnormal fundus examination,"The phrase conveys that the fundus (posterior segment) examination was abnormal, without elaborating on the specific abnormality or adding attributes such as laterality or severity. This is a Clinical finding. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is 164735009 ‘Fundoscopy abnormal (finding)’. ‘Fundus examination’ is clinically equivalent to fundoscopy/ophthalmoscopy. More general parent concepts are insufficiently specific, and more detailed child concepts indicating particular findings (e.g., drusen, hemorrhage) would over-specify beyond the provided wording. Siblings like normal fundus examination or abnormal findings via other methods are not correct."
770396008,Product containing pyrazine (product),"Product containing 1,4-diazine","1,4-diazine is a chemical synonym for pyrazine, so this entry denotes a product that contains pyrazine by its alternative name, without adding dose, route, or other attributes. Main concept: product containing pyrazine. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps to Product containing pyrazine (770396008). Using the synonym does not change the code because it refers to the same substance. Child concepts with presentation details or sibling concepts for other diazine isomers would be incorrect for this wording."
466769005,Rigid rhinolaryngoscope (physical object),Rigid rhinolaryngoscope utilized,"The word 'utilized' indicates use but still identifies the device as a rigid rhinolaryngoscope, a non-flexible scope for nasal and laryngeal visualization. The concept is a Physical object. SCTID 466769005 should be selected because it specifically codes a rigid rhinolaryngoscope; no new device attributes are introduced. Parent or sibling concepts, including flexible variants or single-region scopes, would not capture both rigidity and the rhinolaryngeal application stated."
30801000119107,History of surgically corrected congenital heart defect (situation),Past history lists surgically repaired congenital cardiac defect.,"The phrase locates the information in past history and specifies a surgically repaired congenital cardiac defect. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. It matches the target code exactly, whereas a parent concept omitting the repair or a sibling finding used without history context would be less accurate. The synonyms used (‘cardiac defect’ for ‘heart defect’) are clinically equivalent and do not alter attributes."
422204001,Geographic part of Nunavut (geographic location),A location falling within Nunavut,"The phrase indicates a location that lies within Nunavut but does not identify the whole territory or any particular named place, and it adds no extra attributes, making it a pure geographic reference. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 422204001 is the correct code because it represents a geographic part of Nunavut. Coding to a broader 'Nunavut' concept would be imprecise, and coding to specific localities would be inappropriate. The wording is a clinically safe synonym that preserves the intended meaning."
765419002,Product containing methylated xanthine derivative (product),Medication supplied: product containing methylated xanthine derivative,"This dispensing context entry identifies that the supplied item is a product with a methylated xanthine derivative active ingredient class. The target concept is Product containing methylated xanthine derivative (product). No formulation, strength, route, or brand details are present, so a more granular child concept is not indicated. The phrasing stays within the product category and is distinct from substance-level or class-only concepts."
434334002,Lysobacter brunescens (organism),Organism name: Lysobacter brunescens,"The focus is the organism name Lysobacter brunescens, a species-level taxon. This should be coded to SNOMED CT Organism SCTID 434334002. The label 'Organism name' is contextual and introduces no attributes such as infection, timing, or severity. More general taxonomic parents or different species siblings would be less appropriate."
107624009,Family Lamiaceae (organism),Family: Lamiaceae (mint family),"The text specifies the family as Lamiaceae and includes the common name “mint family” as an equivalent descriptor. No other attributes are present. In SNOMED CT, the Organism concept for this family is 107624009. Parent taxa (e.g., order Lamiales) or child taxa (e.g., Mentha) are not indicated and would misrepresent the rank. The synonym does not alter the intended concept."
438542005,Specimen from vagus nerve (specimen),Sample source: vagus nerve,"This entry uses a lab/requisition style indicating the specimen’s source as the vagus nerve, which is sufficient to code to the Specimen category. The exact concept is “Specimen from vagus nerve (specimen)” [438542005]. General or parent specimen-from-nerve concepts would be less precise, and sibling concepts would misidentify the nerve. The entry does not add laterality, timing, or method, preventing drift into child or procedure concepts and keeping it uniquely codable to the intended specimen."
278599006,Leaking dental crown (finding),Leakage under tooth cap,"The lay term 'tooth cap' is clinically equivalent to 'dental crown,' and the entry indicates leakage of that crown, matching SNOMED CT 278599006 (Clinical finding). No extra attributes are introduced. It remains specific to a crown rather than other restorations and does not imply related but distinct issues like recurrent decay or fit problems."
184225006,Computer record of patient (record artifact),Computerized patient chart,"This denotes the patient’s chart maintained in a computerized format, i.e., a computer record. The main concept is an electronic artifact of the patient record; no extra attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. “Computerized” is a clinically equivalent synonym to electronic/digital, so the concept aligns with 184225006. More general parent records do not specify medium, and sibling concepts like paper charts or application systems would not be the best match."
4341000179107,Microbiology report (record artifact),Report: Microbiology,"This header-style entry clearly indicates a report whose subject area is microbiology, focusing on the document artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and Microbiology report (record artifact), SCTID 4341000179107, is the precise match. It is not a general lab report (parent concept) nor a specific bacteriology/virology report (child/sibling), and it does not imply results content; it names the artifact itself."
298737004,Finding of arrangement of ribs (finding),Disposition of ribs (finding),"‘Disposition’ is a valid synonym for arrangement/configuration and represents a Clinical finding about how the ribs are situated. It maps to SNOMED CT 298737004 by focusing solely on arrangement. No additional descriptors such as abnormality, laterality, or numerical change are implied, so more specific children or different siblings (e.g., number, shape) would be incorrect. The parent would be too general compared to this targeted finding."
713875009,Local anesthetic pectoral compartment nerve block (procedure),Local anesthetic pectoral compartment block,"Dropping the word “nerve” still clearly denotes a pectoral compartment block with local anesthetic, which is clinically synonymous with the SNOMED procedure. Category is Procedure. No guidance, laterality, or subtype attributes are present, so coding to 713875009 is exact. Using a parent like generic nerve block would be under-specified; choosing a subtype like PECS I/II would over-specify."
224005009,St. Croix (geographic location),Returned from St. Croix,"Despite the temporal context of return, the only codable entity expressed is the geographic location “St. Croix.” This best matches St. Croix (geographic location), SCTID 224005009, within the Geographic location hierarchy. The wording does not introduce broader or narrower geographies, so parent or child concepts would be less accurate."
866145009,General patient record note (record artifact),General patient record note (no specific subtype),"This explicitly declares a general patient record note without any specialized subtype, which corresponds precisely to General patient record note SCTID 866145009. The main concept is a non-specialized note artifact in the patient’s record, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Stating ‘no specific subtype’ clarifies it should not map to siblings such as progress, consult, or discharge notes; the entry is more specific than mapping to a broad parent ‘Note’ because it anchors the artifact to the patient record."
399246001,Blackett-Healy projection (qualifier value),Blackett–Healy view,"The phrase 'Blackett–Healy view' is a standard radiology synonym for a named projection; 'view' is commonly used interchangeably with 'projection' in imaging contexts and does not introduce extra attributes. Category: Qualifier value. This maps precisely to SCTID 399246001, as it denotes the same named projection. Parent terms like 'Radiographic view' are too general, and any anatomy-specific siblings would be inappropriate because no body site is stated. The synonym 'view' is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
310443006,Closure of atrial septal defect using patch (procedure),Repair of the atrial septum using patch to close defect,"The main concept is repairing the atrial septum by closing an ASD with a patch. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This is a precise match to SCTID 310443006 due to the patch-based closure technique. Less specific parent concepts (ASD repair without method) and sibling procedures (e.g., device-based closure) are not reflected in the wording. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and does not add any additional attributes beyond the defined technique."
223624002,Nauru (geographic location),Country name recorded: Nauru,"The entry specifies the recorded country name as Nauru, which is a geographic location. It fits within the Environment or geographical location hierarchy, with the precise concept Nauru (geographic location) [223624002]. The documentation phrasing does not imply residence or birthplace; it is a simple identification of the place name. Parent concepts are broader, and there is no mention of a subregion or a different country to suggest child or sibling mappings."
736251000,Stroke care plan (record artifact),CVA care plan,"‘CVA’ (cerebrovascular accident) is a standard clinical synonym for stroke; thus ‘CVA care plan’ aligns exactly with Stroke care plan (record artifact) [736251000]. The main concept is a stroke-focused care plan document; there are no added details like stroke subtype or treatment actions. The category is Record artifact. Parent concepts (generic care plan) lack the stroke specificity, and siblings such as protocols or rehabilitation plans are not suggested. The synonym 'CVA' does not change the concept and remains a clinically equivalent term for stroke."
19605006,"Salmonella IV 57:z4,z23:- (organism)","Identified organism: Salmonella IV 57:z4,z23:-","This entry names the organism specifically as Salmonella IV 57:z4,z23:- and frames it as an identified organism without adding result interpretation or specimen context. It is an Organism category entry mapping to SCTID 19605006. More general parent terms omit the serovar, and sibling serovars differ in antigenic formula, so they do not match. The wording remains taxonomic, not a finding or infection diagnosis."
1366430006,Epileptic seizures induced by patterns (finding),Patient reports epileptic seizures occur with visual pattern viewing,"This patient-reported entry specifies that seizure episodes are epileptic and occur in association with viewing visual patterns, directly reflecting pattern-induced seizure provocation. As a Clinical finding, it captures an observed trigger without adding type, severity, or timing. SCTID 1366430006 is the precise code, as it encodes epileptic seizures induced by patterns. More general parents (epileptic seizures) omit the trigger, and siblings such as 'photosensitive seizures' imply light flicker rather than pattern viewing. The wording remains semantically equivalent to the concept."
223800008,Kilkenny (geographic location),Staying in Kilkenny,"The entry indicates presence in “Kilkenny,” with the location itself being the codable entity. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). It maps most accurately to Kilkenny (geographic location), SCTID 223800008, since there is no detail implying a different or more specific administrative unit. Parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling variants like “Kilkenny City” are not specified. The verb “staying” is contextual and does not alter the identity of the location."
110944006,Peritoneal cytologic material (specimen),Peritoneal cytology collected,"This concise documentation indicates collection of a cytology specimen from the peritoneal cavity; 'peritoneal cytology' is clinically equivalent to 'peritoneal cytologic material.' The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It fits SCTID 110944006 by identifying the correct specimen type and source, without implying specific methods or results. Broader cytology entries without peritoneal origin would be less precise, and more specific children (e.g., ascitic cytology) are not indicated."
1003521000004104,Number of tumor buds in primary malignant neoplasm of colon in microscopic field 0.785 square millimeter (observable entity),"Tumor bud number—primary colon malignancy, single microscopic field of 0.785 mm²","This entry directly states the observable as the number of tumor buds for a primary colon malignancy within one microscopic field sized 0.785 mm². It remains an Observable entity because no value is provided. The site and area specificity point to SCTID 1003521000004104, rather than broader parent concepts or siblings differing by site (e.g., rectum) or field area."
244255002,Entire third obtuse marginal branch of circumflex branch of left coronary artery (body structure),Entire third obtuse marginal branch within the left coronary circumflex distribution,"The entry specifies the anatomical distribution (left coronary circumflex) and identifies the third obtuse marginal branch with “Entire” to denote the full vessel. The main concept is the entire OM3 branch. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It is not a parent (LCx itself or broader distribution) nor a sibling (OM1/OM2), and avoids partial-structure interpretation, aligning with 244255002."
285067000,Cave (environment),Inside a cave,"This phrasing expresses being within the environmental location of a cave, with no events or temporal qualifiers. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Environment or geographical location hierarchy and maps to Cave (environment) [285067000]. A parent concept would be overly broad, while siblings like Mine or Tunnel do not represent a cave. The expression is a straightforward synonym describing the same environment and does not imply any subtype, making the cave concept the precise choice."
363783003,Rh blood group typing (procedure),Rh factor test (blood group typing),"This phrasing indicates laboratory testing aimed at determining Rh factor status as part of blood group typing, emphasizing the procedure rather than a result. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The code Rh blood group typing (procedure) SCTID 363783003 is most appropriate. Parent concepts like general blood group typing are too broad, and sibling concepts like ABO typing or antibody screening are not referenced. “Test” here denotes the procedural act, which is clinically equivalent to typing."
59594008,Product containing nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker (product),Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (medicinal product),"Here, “non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent” denotes the pharmacologic class, and the parenthetical “medicinal product” ensures the product-level meaning. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. This matches SCTID 59594008 because it identifies a product containing that agent class. A generic “neuromuscular blocking agent (medicinal product)” would be too broad, while naming a specific blocker (e.g., cisatracurium) would map to more specific child product concepts. The synonym use is clinically equivalent and does not alter attributes."
248383009,Fontanelle size (observable entity),Fontanelle size monitoring entry,"This denotes a documentation point used to monitor the observable ‘fontanelle size.’ Category: Observable entity. The best code is 248383009 as the content is about the property (size) being tracked, not an interpretive outcome or a specific fontanelle location. Words like ‘monitoring’ provide context but do not change the observable entity being referenced."
223789004,Counties of Republic of Ireland (geographic location),Republic of Ireland county-level geographies,"The phrase denotes the county-level geographies specifically within the Republic of Ireland, corresponding directly to Counties of Republic of Ireland (geographic location), SCTID 223789004. The category is Geographic location. No extra attributes are introduced, and it clearly excludes broader national or different administrative layers, making parent/sibling codes less appropriate. The synonym is safe and equivalent to 'counties' in this context."
282710005,Unable to push and pull a small wheeled toy forwards (finding),Exam: unable to push and pull a small wheeled toy forward.,"The entry documents an examination finding of inability to perform both the push and pull actions to move a small wheeled toy forward, which corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT concept 282710005. The category is Clinical finding as this is a specific observation during exam. It does not add causation, severity, age, or timing. More general parent concepts (e.g., impaired gross motor skills) are less precise, while sibling or child concepts limited to only pushing or only pulling, or different directions, would not match the phrasing. The word “forward” is synonymous with “forwards” and retains the directional attribute required by the concept."
328676004,Gluten-free rice bread (product),Counseling: choose gluten-free rice bread options,"The counseling recommendation points to selecting gluten-free rice bread, a Product consistent with 'Gluten-free rice bread (product)' SCTID 328676004. The word 'options' is contextual and does not introduce different products or attributes. Parent concepts like 'Gluten-free bread (product)' or 'Rice bread (product)' are less precise since both attributes are present here. No sibling product (different grain or specialized form) is implied, preserving the correct code."
315266007,Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri suspected (situation),Referral: suspected cervical cancer,"The referral indicates suspicion of a malignant neoplasm of the cervix and does not confirm diagnosis. This is a Situation with explicit context and maps to SNOMED CT 315266007. No added attributes (histology, stage, cause) are present, so child disorder codes cannot be justified. ‘Cervical cancer’ is a standard synonym for malignant neoplasm of the cervix, and ‘suspected’ clearly sets the context to suspicion rather than confirmation."
438256006,Chlorphenamine tannate (substance),Chlorphenamine (tannate salt),"This denotes the chemical substance chlorphenamine in the tannate salt, without any product, dose, or route details. It therefore maps to the SNOMED CT Substance category. The most accurate code is Chlorphenamine tannate (substance) SCTID 438256006. A more general parent like chlorphenamine (substance) would omit the salt specificity, and sibling salts or medicinal products are excluded by the wording which focuses solely on the tannate salt of the substance."
737142009,Crepitus of left temporomandibular joint on opening (finding),Documented crepitus of the left TMJ on opening phase.,"The entry clearly documents crepitus localized to the left TMJ during the opening phase, capturing the required attributes. Category: Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 737142009 is the most precise match. Parent concepts that do not include left laterality or the opening phase would be too general, and sibling concepts focusing on right laterality or closing would be incorrect. The wording does not introduce cause, severity, or other attributes beyond the defined concept."
263969006,Centriacinar (qualifier value),Centriacinar zonation,"Zonation here is used to indicate the zone within the acinus, specified as centriacinar, without implying disease or other attributes. It is a Qualifier value properly coded as Centriacinar (qualifier value) [263969006]. Generic parent descriptors would be too broad, and sibling qualifiers like panacinar or paraseptal denote different zones. The term stays within the realm of pure localization/distribution, so the centriacinar qualifier code is the most precise match."
44394001,Copper naphthenate (substance),The compound noted is copper naphthenate,"The wording specifies the compound copper naphthenate, remaining within the chemical identity and not introducing usage, dose, or clinical effect. SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 44394001 corresponds to copper naphthenate. A broader concept like copper compound or a different naphthenate would be less accurate. There is no indication of a product formulation or exposure event."
248749004,Grafting of temporalis muscle to orbit with exenteration of orbit (procedure),Exenteration of the orbit with inset of temporalis muscle graft,"The entry specifies orbital exenteration and inset (placement) of a temporalis muscle graft to the orbit. This is a Procedure. “Inset” is standard surgical phrasing for graft placement and is equivalent to grafting, making SCTID 248749004 correct. Parent-only or sibling procedures with different materials/approaches would be less precise, and the entry avoids any additional attributes."
275939003,Family history: Triglyceride high (situation),FHx: elevated triglycerides,"This shorthand entry documents family history (FHx) of elevated triglycerides, clearly indicating the family context and the specific lipid component (triglycerides). SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 275939003 is the most precise match because it covers a family history of high triglyceride levels. A parent like family history of dyslipidemia would be overly broad, and a sibling such as family history of high LDL would be inapplicable. 'Elevated' is a standard synonym for 'high' and does not alter the meaning or add attributes."
710236006,Does not perform personal grooming activity (finding),Caregiver report: omits personal grooming,"This reflects a caregiver's observation that personal grooming is omitted, i.e., not performed. The central concept is the absence of grooming activity. Category: Clinical finding. 'Omits' is semantically equivalent to 'does not perform.' It does not introduce causation or quality assessments, and does not shift to hygiene or general self-care. SCTID 710236006 is the most specific and appropriate code."
431481001,Chronic pain due to injury (finding),Chronic pain as a result of injury,"“As a result of injury” unambiguously denotes causation, and the entry includes “chronic pain,” making it a precise match to Chronic pain due to injury (SCTID 431481001) under Clinical findings. It is more specific than Chronic pain or Pain due to injury alone, and it refrains from adding body site, severity, or related conditions that could invoke a different, more specific code."
926001,Embolectomy with catheter of radial artery by incision of upper limb (procedure),Arm incision approach for catheter embolectomy of the radial artery,"The entry specifies the approach (incision in the arm/upper limb), method (catheter embolectomy), and site (radial artery). The main medical concept is a procedural embolectomy with these attributes. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 926001 is the most precise match, as it requires radial artery site plus catheter method and upper limb incision. Parent concepts that omit site or method are insufficiently detailed, and sibling concepts like brachial or ulnar artery embolectomy or percutaneous embolectomy are excluded. The term “arm” is synonymous with upper limb and does not alter coding."
204970007,Entire fetal chest contents (body structure),Entire intrathoracic contents of the fetus,"This wording indicates all structures located within the fetal thorax, using 'intrathoracic' to denote location and 'entire' for completeness. As a Body structure, it maps to SCTID 204970007. Concepts that represent the thoracic cavity, chest wall, or chest region alone do not capture 'contents,' and organ-specific children are too narrow. The synonym choice is clinically equivalent and does not alter the code selection."
282178001,Ability to walk up step (observable entity),Functional status entry: ability to walk up step,"This entry locates the observable in a functional status documentation framework while retaining the precise activity: walking up one step. It is an Observable entity best coded as Ability to walk up step (282178001). The entry does not add findings (e.g., impairment), number of steps, or assistance, so it does not drift to parent/sibling or to a clinical finding."
216458006,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, wood (environment)",Clinician documentation: accident/poisoning place of occurrence—wood environment,"This documentation explicitly records the place of occurrence in an external cause context as a wood environment. SNOMED CT 216458006 is purpose-built for that environmental specification. A parent concept would be insufficiently specific, and sibling environments would not match. The phrase confines itself to location context without implying any additional attributes."
225740007,Regional center (environment),Regional centre,"The concept expressed is the same place type—regional center—using UK spelling. The SNOMED CT category is Environment (environment). “Centre” is a clinically safe, semantically equivalent spelling variant and does not introduce new attributes or imply a specific function. This aligns exactly with SCTID 225740007 and avoids mapping to broader parents (generic centers) or siblings like “regional hospital” or “community centre,” which would change the meaning. Thus, it remains the most precise match to Regional center (environment)."
263727000,Convergence (qualifier value),Documentation tag: Convergence,"This labels a documentation tag as 'Convergence', serving as a qualifier rather than a clinical outcome or diagnosis. The concept is a qualifier value, and the correct SNOMED CT code is Convergence (qualifier value) [263727000]. Since no measurement, test, or abnormality is stated, mapping to observable entities, procedures, or disorders related to convergence would be less accurate."
91362006,Rhinencephalon structure (body structure),Gross anatomy specimen: rhinencephalon identified,"In gross anatomy context, the phrase identifies the rhinencephalon as the anatomical focus, not introducing condition or substructure details. This aligns with SNOMED CT 91362006 (Body structure). Referring to the whole rhinencephalon is more specific than brain parents and not as narrow as child elements like the olfactory bulb, maintaining an exact match."
708212001,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Candida glabrata (substance),Analyte: Candida glabrata DNA,"Despite the contextual label “Analyte,” the only medical concept specified is the substance Candida glabrata DNA, which is a Substance concept in SNOMED CT. SCTID 708212001 is the precise code. The entry does not assert presence/absence, quantity, or specimen source; it simply names the substance. Coding to a parent DNA concept would lose organism specificity, and siblings like Candida albicans DNA or Candida glabrata RNA would be incorrect. The analyte label does not change the substance identity."
1306634002,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with mandible postured forward (record artifact),"Photographic extraoral image, 45-degree right half facial view demonstrating record artifact of forward mandibular posture","This text states a photographic extraoral image of the right half of the face at a 45-degree view and identifies it as a record artifact characterized by forward mandibular posture. The primary concept is the specific imaging record artifact, not a clinical finding. Category: Record artifact. It is the most precise match because it includes the exact modality (photographic extraoral), orientation (45° right half of face), and artifact feature (mandible postured forward). A parent such as general facial photo artifact would be too nonspecific, and a sibling referring to left view or neutral mandible would be incorrect. Synonyms like “photographic image” vs “photo” and “forward” vs “anterior” are equivalent and do not introduce new attributes."
225739005,Client's room (environment),Client's room area,"Using 'area' here remains within the same environmental concept, focusing on the client's room without elaborating on type or condition. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It matches SCTID 225739005 since it is the client-specific room environment. Mapping to a broader 'Area (environment)' would lose specificity, and mapping to a sibling like 'Bedroom' would incorrectly imply a home setting."
406456001,Product containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist product receptor antagonist (product),N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist drug product,"This identifies a drug product categorized by its mechanism as an NMDA receptor antagonist and avoids specifying any molecule, formulation, or clinical use. It fits the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category, matching SCTID 406456001. A generic receptor antagonist product (parent) would be less precise, while naming a particular NMDA antagonist (child) would exceed the statement. Using “drug product” is a valid synonym for medicinal product and preserves the product-level coding."
601000220109,Newborn discharge summary (record artifact),Newborn discharge summary (document),"The entry explicitly labels this as a document, which aligns with the record artifact classification. The core concept is a discharge summary specific to a newborn. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This is best coded as Newborn discharge summary (record artifact) SCTID 601000220109 rather than the general discharge summary parent, because the newborn qualifier is essential to precision. No additional clinical attributes are introduced, and it does not imply a different artifact (e.g., a letter or note)."
470125003,Mammographic stereotactic biopsy system (physical object),QC completed on mammographic stereotactic biopsy system,"Quality control context still identifies the specific device: the mammographic stereotactic biopsy system. Category: Physical object/device. The entry does not alter modality or function and does not imply procedural coding. It is more specific than parent device categories, justifying SCTID 470125003."
328704008,Gluten-free pasta spirals (product),Counseling handout example—gluten-free pasta spirals,"The handout example lists gluten-free pasta spirals, matching SNOMED CT 328704008. Main concept: gluten-free spiral pasta product. Category: Product. The educational context does not change the product identity; broader gluten-free pasta or spiral pasta without gluten-free would be incomplete, and other shapes would be wrong. The entry avoids any added attributes beyond shape and gluten-free status."
185249001,Seen in prostate clinic (finding),She was seen in the prostate clinic.,"This sentence documents that the patient (female pronoun used for narrative) was seen in the prostate clinic; no extra attributes are added. The main concept is “seen in prostate clinic,” a Clinical finding. SCTID 185249001 is the correct, most specific code because it states the clinic type explicitly. Parent concepts lack specificity, and siblings naming different clinics would not fit. The pronoun choice does not alter the clinical meaning, which remains the fact of being seen in the prostate clinic."
257633002,Industrial yard (environment),Reported environment: industrial yard,"The entry indicates that the reported environment is an industrial yard, which matches SCTID 257633002. Main concept: environment/location. Category: Environment or geographical location. It does not introduce events, causes, or other clinical details. The phrase remains specific and avoids parents or siblings, making the industrial yard concept the exact fit."
1352813001,Union for International Cancer Control ypNX (qualifier value),Oncologist note: UICC ypNX recorded,"The oncologist note records UICC ypNX, the post-therapy pathologic nodal category indicating NX. This is a TNM 'Qualifier value' that aligns directly with SCTID 1352813001. The phrasing is a faithful synonymic documentation of the same concept. Parent or sibling concepts differing in timing (p, c) or nodal result (N0/N1) are not supported by this wording."
337951000112106,Unroofing of cyst of liver (procedure),Operative procedure: unroofing of cyst of liver,"Framed as an operative procedure line, this entry clearly identifies unroofing of a liver cyst as the performed surgical action, with no approach or timing qualifiers beyond the operative context. The main concept is unroofing/deroofing of a hepatic cyst, a SNOMED CT Procedure, precisely mapping to SCTID 337951000112106. Parent concepts omit the site and would be too general; children introduce approach details not present. Sibling procedures (e.g., excision or drainage) are different in technique and would not match the wording."
225014007,Feeling empty (finding),Notes feeling empty.,"This entry records the presence of the emotional state of emptiness, without qualifiers. It is a Clinical finding and should be coded to Feeling empty (finding) SCTID 225014007. Other emotional concepts (sadness, numbness, anhedonia) are not present, and no physical symptom location is given. The concise phrasing remains uniquely aligned to this concept."
389228009,Genus Homo (organism),Database taxon: Homo (genus),"The phrase records a database taxon entry as Homo, specified to the genus rank. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It avoids species and higher taxa, making the genus-level concept the most precise mapping. Sibling taxa are not alluded to. 'Database taxon' is context only and does not change the organism concept being Genus Homo."
260964002,Number of stones removed (qualifier value),Number of stones removed,"The entry explicitly denotes the count property for stones that have been removed, without specifying any numeric value or additional attributes. The main medical concept is the quantitative descriptor of removal activity for stones. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value, as it represents a data element used to qualify another record with a count. It is the most precise match for SCTID 260964002 because it directly names the property 'number of stones removed.' Broader parent qualifiers like generic 'number' or 'count' would be too vague, and sibling concepts such as 'number of stones present' or 'number of stones passed' describe different properties. No procedural or anatomical details are introduced, keeping it aligned with the qualifier value."
215955007,"Explosion on aircraft while landing, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)",Transport event: explosion on aircraft at landing phase injuring commercial aircrew member (surface-to-surface transport).,"This transport event description includes an explosion on the aircraft at the landing phase injuring a commercial aircrew member, with surface-to-surface transport specified. The main concept is an Event. It maps directly to SCTID 215955007 by including mechanism, location, phase, role, and transport context. “Commercial aircrew member” and “landing phase” are clinically equivalent synonyms of the preferred attributes. Parent concepts without phase/role details, and siblings for passengers or other phases, would be less precise."
243998002,Structure of surface region of upper arm (body structure),Observation area designated: upper arm surface region,"The designated observation area is the surface region of the upper arm, fitting the Body structure category. The phrasing maintains focus on the external surface topography without adding attributes like side, cause, or depth. It avoids mapping to the parent upper arm structure and to siblings such as the skin of upper arm. SCTID 243998002 is the most precise code."
58787004,Aspartate-transfer ribonucleic acid ligase (substance),Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS),"The entry gives the enzyme name and its common abbreviation, explicitly denoting the substance that charges tRNA with aspartate. No extra attributes (such as species origin or clinical interpretation) are added. This fits the SNOMED CT Substance category and corresponds to Aspartate-transfer ribonucleic acid ligase (SCTID 58787004). Broader parents (e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) are less precise, and sibling enzymes targeting other amino acids are incorrect. The inclusion of the abbreviation does not change the concept and is an accepted synonym."
39888004,Streptococcus salivarius (organism),Target species: Streptococcus salivarius,"The named concept is the organism Streptococcus salivarius, categorized under Organism. SCTID 39888004 matches precisely. The context of being a “target” does not imply detection, infection, or location, maintaining pure taxonomic identification. Parent genus concepts are too broad, and other species are incorrect, confirming the species-level organism code."
286811001,Pressure limited cycling method (qualifier value),Pressure-limited breath cycling,"The entry states that breath cycling is pressure-limited, which aligns directly with the qualifier value 286811001. Category: Qualifier value. It does not add attributes such as flow, time, or volume criteria, nor does it imply a particular mode or trigger, so sibling concepts remain inapplicable."
215582008,"Submersion or drowning due to fall from gangplank, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)","Patient states: ""I was an occupant of a small unpowered boat, fell off the gangplank and went underwater; I was injured.""","The patient-reported phrasing conveys submersion (“went underwater”), the mechanism (fell off the gangplank), and that the injured person is an occupant of a small unpowered boat. This is an external cause Event and corresponds to SCTID 215582008. Broader parent codes would not capture the gangplank or boat-occupant context. Sibling concepts with different platforms or powered vessels would not match. The synonym “went underwater” is a plain-language equivalent of submersion; no intent, severity, or timing is added."
127956006,Structure of non-autonomic peripheral nerve of the trunk (body structure),Somatic peripheral trunk nerve,"This concise entry denotes a somatic (non-autonomic) peripheral nerve of the trunk. Main concept: anatomical peripheral nerve in the trunk region, non-autonomic. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The term “somatic” is equivalent to “non-autonomic,” and “trunk” specifies the body region, making SCTID 127956006 appropriate. A broader parent like “peripheral nerve structure” would lack the location qualifier, while autonomic nerve structures are excluded by the wording. No specific trunk nerve is named, so child concepts are not implied."
21840007,Date of last menstrual period (observable entity),OB intake: date of last menstrual period,"Within an obstetric intake context, the observable being captured is the LMP date. This remains an Observable entity and maps directly to SCTID 21840007. Parent or sibling concepts like general obstetric history or gestational age would be inaccurate because this entry is narrowly about the date of the LMP. The context label ‘OB intake’ does not add clinical attributes; it frames where the observation is recorded."
443273008,Measurement of vincristine (procedure),Quantification of vincristine,"This wording denotes a quantitative measurement procedure of the drug vincristine. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 443273008 is appropriate because quantification directly aligns with measurement of vincristine. The entry does not introduce attributes such as specimen, timing, or monitoring purpose. Parent concepts like generic drug quantification are less precise, and child concepts specifying specimen type or therapeutic drug monitoring contexts are more specific than the entry. It does not reference any sibling analyte, keeping the match exact."
218051004,Accident caused by scissors (event),Accident involving a pair of scissors,"This states an accident and identifies the causal instrument as a pair of scissors, with no additional clinical or contextual details. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 218051004 is exact, as it captures accidents with scissors. A generic accident event would be too broad, and injury disorders (e.g., laceration) would add clinical content not present. “Involving a pair of scissors” is equivalent to specifying scissors as the cause."
264784000,Akiyami A (qualifier value),Akiyami category A,"“Category A” explicitly conveys the A-level designation within the Akiyami classification without introducing other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This is a direct match to SCTID 264784000. A parent concept would be too generic (the classification system as a whole), while siblings (Category B, Category C) would be inaccurate for the stated letter."
701640009,Deep brain stimulation therapy management application software (physical object),Installed deep brain stimulation therapy management application software,"The entry indicates the software is installed, but that does not change the object identity: DBS therapy management application software. The main concept is the application software dedicated to DBS therapy management. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It precisely maps to SCTID 701640009 and avoids hardware programmer or system-level concepts. Installation status is a context, not an attribute that would alter coding."
722446000,Allergy record (record artifact),Allergy record present,"The entry asserts that an allergy record is present, which unambiguously points to a documentation artifact and not the clinical presence of allergy. No additional attributes are included. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 722446000 is the most fitting code, aligning with the existence of an allergy record. Broader parents would be nonspecific, and narrower children (e.g., specific allergy-type records) are not implied. “Present” confirms the artifact without altering the concept."
1335896005,Detection of Lentivirus antibody (observable entity),Diagnostic report: lentivirus antibody detection,"Placed in a diagnostic report context, the entry still denotes the observable for detecting antibodies to lentivirus. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. No additional attributes (e.g., results, method, timing, or subtype) are introduced. Therefore, SCTID 1335896005 is the most accurate code, rather than a parent generic or child HIV-specific antibody detection concept."
284565008,Desert environment (environment),Desert environmental context,"“Environmental context” directly conveys the environment concept, and “desert” specifies its type without extra qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The correct code is SCTID 284565008 Desert environment, which represents the desert setting. Parent concepts are too general, while siblings like Desert climate or exposure situations would be mismatches, as neither climate nor exposure is mentioned."
1331991007,Tissue specimen from right breast (specimen),Right-sided breast tissue specimen,"The phrase specifies a tissue specimen and indicates the laterality as right-sided for the breast. Main concept: a specimen composed of tissue; attribute: source site is the right breast. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. “Right-sided” unambiguously conveys right laterality. This matches SCTID 1331991007 precisely. Parent concepts (breast tissue specimen without side) and siblings (left breast tissue specimen, or non-tissue right breast specimen) are excluded. No procedural or fixation details are provided, avoiding more specific child concepts."
432783000,Aspiration of foot using fluoroscopic guidance (procedure),Fluoro-guided aspiration of foot.,"This expresses an aspiration of the foot performed under fluoroscopic (fluoro) guidance. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The abbreviation 'fluoro-guided' is a common clinical synonym for 'fluoroscopy-guided' and does not change the meaning. It matches SCTID 432783000 by specifying foot as the site and fluoroscopy as the guidance technique. It avoids added attributes (laterality, joint details), so narrower child concepts are not indicated, and it is more precise than parent concepts that omit guidance."
216406000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, office (environment)",Site of accident/poisoning: office facility.,"This entry specifies the site of an accident or poisoning as an office facility, which fits Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, office (environment) (216406000). The main concept is the environmental location; the wording avoids mechanism, timing, or activity, focusing only on site. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (environment). A parent concept is too general, and sibling sites like home or school would not be accurate. “Office facility” is a synonym for an office environment and does not alter the code selection."
414483006,Indoor football arena (environment),Environmental context: indoor football arena,"The phrase focuses on the environmental context, explicitly an indoor football arena. The main concept is a physical setting with defined attributes (indoor enclosure, football use, arena type). This maps to the Environment category in SNOMED CT, with SCTID 414483006 as the exact match. Parent categories like 'sports environment' would be too broad, and siblings such as 'indoor multi-sport arena' or 'football field (outdoor)' would mismatch the specificity. No additional attributes are introduced, ensuring unambiguous coding to the specified environment."
414050008,Drug action observation (finding),Pharmacologic action observation,"This entry indicates a finding that a pharmacologic action was observed, using 'pharmacologic action' as a synonym for 'drug action.' The main concept is an observation, which is a Clinical finding. It maps specifically to 'Drug action observation (finding)' because it denotes that the drug's pharmacologic action has been observed, without adding attributes such as mechanism details, outcomes, or severity. A generic parent would be too broad, and related concepts like adverse reactions or therapeutic responses would introduce extra meaning not present. The synonym preserves equivalence and does not change the code."
385440003,Lowered (qualifier value),Chart annotation: lowered,"The chart annotation contains the term 'lowered', representing a Qualifier value only. This aligns with SNOMED CT Lowered (qualifier value) [385440003]. The surrounding context does not add attributes like severity or timing. Since the specific lexical form 'lowered' is used, other qualifier values (e.g., 'low', 'decreased') are less appropriate."
127482009,Tissue specimen from ovary (specimen),Tissue specimen from ovary,"This entry exactly restates the concept: a specimen consisting of tissue and sourced from the ovary. It is a Specimen class entity. The wording aligns directly with SNOMED CT 'Tissue specimen from ovary' (127482009). More general concepts like 'Specimen from ovary' lack the tissue qualifier, and more specific children such as biopsy or surgical excision specimens would add method or extent not present here."
16088291000119106,History of partial replacement of joint of bilateral shoulders with prosthesis (situation),PSH: bilateral partial shoulder arthroplasty with prosthesis.,"“PSH” places the statement within past surgical history, and the entry specifies bilateral shoulders, partial arthroplasty, and prosthesis, which exactly reflects the situation concept for history of partial shoulder joint replacement bilaterally with prosthesis (SCTID 16088291000119106). Category: Situation. This is more specific than a general history of shoulder arthroplasty (parent) and avoids misclassification as total shoulder arthroplasty (sibling). It does not introduce attributes such as indication, time, or device subtype, ensuring precise matching to the given concept."
24672009,"Galvanic skin response, function (observable entity)",Galvanic skin response — function observed,"The text centers on the galvanic skin response function and notes observation context without adding results or interpretations. This fits the Observable entity category for the function itself (SCTID 24672009). Parent or sibling concepts such as general skin function, GSR testing procedures, or abnormal GSR findings would introduce broader or different semantics not present in the entry. The phrasing is a safe paraphrase of the preferred concept, maintaining equivalence and avoiding new attributes."
223623008,Kiribati (geographic location),Place name recorded: Kiribati,"This records the place name Kiribati, referring to the country as a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). The entry does not imply residence, origin, or travel, so the precise match is Kiribati (geographic location) SCTID 223623008. Parent or sibling geographic concepts would be less accurate, and no child locations are specified."
288561005,Special hospital (environment),Facility type recorded as special hospital,"This indicates the recorded facility type is a special hospital, still centering on the environment rather than clinical events or conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. “Facility type” is a documentation descriptor that preserves the semantics; thus Special hospital (environment) SCTID 288561005 is appropriate, whereas parent or subtype concepts would be over- or under-specific."
266918002,Tobacco smoking consumption (observable entity),Tobacco smoking consumption for preventive care risk assessment,"The entry situates the observable consumption related to tobacco smoking within a risk assessment context, without providing quantities or timing. This is an Observable entity; SNOMED CT 266918002 is appropriate. Parent concepts involving overall tobacco use would introduce non-smoking forms and thus be broader than intended. Siblings like smoking status are behavioral findings rather than consumption metrics. Children specifying particular units or modalities (cigarettes/day, pack-years) are not implied by the text."
445917006,Laparoscopic excision of retroperitoneal lymph node (procedure),Laparoscopic removal of retroperitoneal lymph node,"This describes a surgical Procedure where a retroperitoneal lymph node is removed via laparoscopy. 'Removal' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'excision' in surgical context for lymph nodes. SCTID 445917006 is the most accurate code because it specifies both the site and the laparoscopic approach. Parent concepts lacking approach detail or siblings like open removal, biopsy, or broader lymphadenectomy would not match the exact phrasing, which denotes a single-node excision via laparoscopy."
770393000,Product containing nucleotide (product),Catalog entry: nucleotide-containing product,"Despite the catalog context, the coded concept is a product containing nucleotide, matching the SNOMED Product category and SCTID 770393000. No details about use, route, or specific nucleotide are given that would necessitate a child concept. A broader parent 'Product' would omit the defining nucleotide attribute. The phrasing is a safe synonym and keeps the semantic focus on nucleotide content in a product."
443571000124100,Modular formula component (product),Modular formula component (generic product),"This entry clarifies that the product is a modular component of a formula and is generic, without naming a specific nutrient or brand, keeping the concept general. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It maps directly to 443571000124100, Modular formula component (product). Using a parent like Nutritional product would not capture the modular-component specificity, and children like modular protein or carbohydrate components are not supported by the wording. Sibling concepts such as complete formulas are not referenced. The term 'generic' does not change the core concept, so the original code is appropriate."
29660000,Structure of inferior phrenic artery (body structure),Anatomy teaching reference: inferior phrenic artery,"In an educational context, the inferior phrenic artery is referenced as an anatomical entity without additional qualifiers. This is a Body structure concept. SCTID 29660000 is the correct code, specifying the exact artery. Using a parent like 'phrenic artery' risks including superior phrenic arteries, and child terms with laterality are not intended. The teaching context does not introduce attributes beyond the structure."
1365797001,Photographic extraoral image of face with close up smile and lips visible (record artifact),Extraoral face photograph with close-up smile and lips in view.,"This entry names a photograph of the face taken extraorally and adds the specific content: close-up smile with lips in view. The category is Record artifact. It precisely matches SCTID 1365797001 by including the modality and detailed content constraints. More general extraoral facial photo concepts would lack the smile/lips element, while siblings describing other regions or expressions do not fit. “Lips in view” is semantically equivalent to “lips visible,” preserving code selection."
763443002,Repair of right partial cleft lip (procedure),Operative procedure: right-sided partial cleft lip repair,"An operative description specifying a repair of a right-sided partial cleft lip. Category: Procedure. The exact match is SNOMED CT 763443002, tailored to right partial cleft lip repair. Parent concepts that omit laterality/extent and sibling concepts involving the left side or complete cleft are not appropriate. The phrasing maintains the same attributes as the preferred term."
299615006,No passive range of toe abduction (finding),Passive toe abduction: none,"This entry documents that passive toe abduction has no observable range. It conveys passive movement, the motion (toe abduction), and the magnitude (none). As a Clinical finding, it aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 299615006 for 'No passive range of toe abduction.' A parent concept covering general passive motion or a sibling indicating active motion would be less accurate. The phrasing 'none' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'no passive range' and does not change the intended code."
216411003,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, radio broadcasting station (environment)",Patient states the accident occurred at the radio broadcasting station,"This patient-reported statement provides the place of an accident as a radio broadcasting station. Category: Environment or geographical location. The explicit radio broadcasting station environment maps directly to SCTID 216411003 without adding other attributes. More general parent concepts would lose specificity, and sibling environments (e.g., television station) are not suggested. The focus remains solely on location."
430232008,Specimen from trunk (specimen),Sample from trunk,"The term 'sample' here denotes a laboratory/pathology specimen and the phrase specifies the trunk as the anatomical source. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to 430232008 because it defines the source region exactly. Parent concepts are less specific, and children like 'from chest' or 'from abdomen' are not explicitly referenced. No collection method or specimen type is introduced."
1471007,Elastin (substance),Elastin structural protein,"This entry labels elastin as a structural protein, which is a clinically accurate characterization of the same substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; the exact match is Elastin (SCTID 1471007). The phrase does not infer a different entity such as a tissue, fiber, or test, nor does it specify any variant like tropoelastin. A parent concept like Structural protein would be overly broad, and other ECM proteins are not referenced. It remains uniquely tied to the elastin substance."
258144009,Position change (qualifier value),Position change — clinician note,"The wording presents 'position change' as a value, with the context that it appears in a clinician note, which does not change the concept’s attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value coded as Position change (qualifier value) SCTID 258144009. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., specific postures or repositioning procedures) are not indicated and would add specificity not present. The entry is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
328685004,Gluten-free flour (product),Diet order: gluten-free flour,"The ordered item is specifically gluten-free flour, a Product in SNOMED CT. The appropriate code is 328685004 (Gluten-free flour). The diet order context does not alter the product identity or add attributes. A parent such as 'flour' lacks the gluten-free specification, and a more general sibling like 'gluten-free diet' or 'gluten-free food' does not target the flour product. No subtype or mixture is mentioned, avoiding child concepts, ensuring that 328685004 is exact."
418433008,Surgical intensive care unit (environment),Inpatient location: surgical intensive care unit,"The inpatient location is identified as the surgical ICU, which is an environmental setting. The category is Environment. The full designation supports mapping to 418433008. Using a parent ICU environment would lose the surgical specialty detail, and sibling ICU environments (e.g., medical ICU) do not match."
20247009,Balistes polylepis (organism),Balistes polylepis (finescale triggerfish),This entry presents both the scientific and common names. 'Finescale triggerfish' is a recognized synonym for Balistes polylepis and does not alter the coded concept. It remains an Organism concept; SCTID 20247009 is appropriate. Using a broader term like 'triggerfish' alone would risk mapping to higher-level taxa or to sibling species.
313369000,Had a chat to parent (situation),Parent discussion noted in chart,"The entry communicates that a discussion with the patient’s parent occurred and was recorded, aligning with the situation of having a chat. Category: Situation. SCTID 313369000 is most precise because the essential concept is the completed verbal interaction with a parent, without mode or topic details. Documentation context does not change the coded concept. More specific variants would add attributes not present here."
280751002,Entire pedicle of twelfth thoracic vertebra (body structure),Full pedicle of the T12 vertebra,"The entry indicates the anatomical pedicle of the T12 vertebra and signifies entirety via “full.” The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This precisely fits SCTID 280751002 because it is the whole pedicle at T12, with no mention of laterality or partial segments. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings refer to different anatomical parts of T12. “Full” is an acceptable synonym for “entire,” not changing the concept coding."
429009003,History of left mastectomy (situation),Previous left mastectomy,"“Previous” denotes a past event, and “left mastectomy” defines the intervention and laterality. The main concept is a historical left-sided mastectomy. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. This is best represented by History of left mastectomy (429009003). Unspecified laterality history concepts are less precise, and procedure codes would misclassify the temporal context. No additional attributes (e.g., reason or extent) are introduced."
270389004,Mobility allowance claim representative (record artifact),History section entry: mobility allowance claim representative,"The phrase identifies a history section record entry for the representative associated with a mobility allowance claim. As a Record artifact, it aligns with SCTID 270389004 and adds no extra properties like status or authorization. Generic representative records would be too broad, and claim-only records would lack the representative component. The wording remains equivalent to the preferred term."
449122003,Genus Philesturnus (organism),Reference taxon—Philesturnus genus,The phrase indicates Philesturnus used as a reference taxon at genus rank. The main concept is the genus Philesturnus within the Organism hierarchy. SCTID 449122003 is the correct match because the entry does not describe species or broader taxa. ‘Reference taxon’ is contextual language that does not alter taxonomy; specifying ‘genus’ ensures the rank remains at the genus level and not at a parent or sibling concept.
384747005,Specimen from lung obtained by needle biopsy using computed tomography guidance (specimen),Imaging-guided specimen: lung needle biopsy under computed tomography,"The entry states a specimen obtained via lung needle biopsy using computed tomography guidance, which matches the target concept. 'Imaging-guided' clarified as computed tomography ensures correct guidance modality. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It does not introduce laterality or needle subtype, so it fits SCTID 384747005 best. Parent concepts that do not specify CT or needle biopsy are too general, and siblings specifying core or FNA would be too narrow. The synonyms used are standard and do not impact code selection."
217404006,Burning caused by conflagration in factory (event),Manufacturing facility fire (burning),"A 'manufacturing facility' is a clinically equivalent synonym for factory, and 'fire (burning)' denotes conflagration with burning as the event being recorded. The main concept is the event of burning caused by conflagration in a factory; attributes include location (manufacturing facility) and the nature of the event (burning due to fire). The SNOMED CT category is Event. This is the most precise match for SCTID 217404006, avoiding parent concepts without factory specification and excluding sibling concepts focused on injuries, exposures, or other settings."
122578001,Female genital fluid specimen (specimen),Female genital fluid sample,"The entry describes a sample consisting of fluid taken from the female genital tract, without naming exact subsite or collection technique. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 122578001 is the correct match as it denotes a fluid specimen from female genital anatomy. More general parent terms include non-fluid specimens and are less precise, whereas child terms such as “vaginal fluid sample” or “cervical mucus sample” would add site specificity not present here. Sibling concepts like swab specimens are not suggested."
226675007,Individual cakes and pastries (substance),Individual cakes and pastries,"The main concept expressed is the substance class “individual cakes and pastries,” exactly matching the preferred term. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This wording aligns precisely with SCTID 226675007, which characterizes single-item cake or pastry foods without adding type, flavor, or other qualifiers. A broader parent like “cakes and pastries” would omit the individual-unit qualifier, and child or sibling concepts naming specific items (e.g., cupcake, croissant) would introduce specificity not present here. Because the entry mirrors the preferred term, it is the most precise match."
420110001,Do not take indigestion remedies at the same time of day as this medicine (qualifier value),Patient advised: do not take indigestion remedies at the same time as this medicine.,"This documents a counseling context but preserves the core instruction to avoid taking indigestion remedies at the same time as the medicine. It remains a Qualifier value, functioning as a medication advisory qualifier. The semantics are unchanged, thus SCTID 420110001 is the precise mapping. Parent or sibling concepts that remove the indigestion remedy focus or add other constraints (e.g., food interactions) would be less suitable, and introducing specific products or intervals would be overly narrow."
230994001,Evacuation of spinal intradural extramedullary abscess (procedure),Evacuation of intrathecal extramedullary spinal abscess,"Here, “intrathecal” is used as a clinically equivalent synonym to intradural (within the dural sac/subarachnoid space), paired with extramedullary and the spinal site, and the action is evacuation of an abscess. Category: Procedure. SCTID 230994001 remains the best match because the intended compartment is intradural extramedullary; intrathecal is a common clinical synonym without changing the site. Parents are too nonspecific, and siblings (epidural/intramedullary) misidentify the compartment. No extra attributes are added."
470110003,Magnetic dental precision attachment (physical object),Dental precision attachment — magnetic type,"By specifying “magnetic type,” the entry identifies the precise subtype of dental precision attachment. The concept is a Physical object. It does not include any additional attributes and excludes other retention mechanisms (e.g., ball, bar). Hence, parent concepts are too broad and siblings are different designs, making SCTID 470110003 the accurate selection."
168563001,Plain X-ray of nose abnormal (finding),Abnormal nasal roentgenogram,"“Roentgenogram” is a synonym for plain X-ray, and “nasal” indicates the nose. The entry states the imaging result is abnormal without further attributes, matching the intended concept. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 168563001 is appropriate as it encodes abnormal findings on a plain X-ray of the nose. Broader or sibling concepts (e.g., abnormal CT of nose) would not match the modality, and child concepts specifying substructures would be too specific. The synonym “roentgenogram” does not change the clinical meaning."
302608002,Alpha non-hemolytic streptococcus (organism),Alpha non–hemolytic streptococcus species,"The entry identifies the organism class by name and adds “species” in a non-specific sense, which remains within the Organism category and maps to SCTID 302608002. It does not introduce site, disease, or temporal attributes. More general parents (e.g., Streptococcus) are less precise, and concepts naming specific species or groups (e.g., viridans streptococci) would be incorrect given the wording. The inclusion of “species” does not alter the organism identity and is clinically equivalent."
52393002,Endometrial cavity structure (body structure),Label: endometrial cavity,"Using ‘Label’ provides documentation context, but the substantive concept is the endometrial cavity itself, an anatomical Body structure. It maps to SCTID 52393002 and does not introduce findings or procedural details. A more general ‘uterine cavity’ would be less specific, and ‘endometrium’ refers to the lining tissue rather than the cavity. Therefore, this entry remains uniquely codable to the endometrial cavity structure."
245825009,Structure of mucosa of vestibular surface of mandibular gingiva (body structure),Gingival mucosa on vestibular aspect of lower jaw,"This entry uses ‘lower jaw’ as a synonym for mandible and specifies the vestibular aspect of the gingiva, clearly indicating the target structure. The main concept is a Body structure describing mucosa of mandibular gingiva on the vestibular side. It maps to SCTID 245825009 because it includes gingival mucosa, mandibular location, and vestibular surface. A parent such as ‘gingival mucosa’ would be less specific, and a sibling like ‘gingival mucosa on lingual aspect of lower jaw’ would be incorrect. ‘Lower jaw’ and ‘vestibular aspect’ are clinically equivalent terms that maintain precision."
285155000,Railway embankment (environment),Patient states they were on a railway embankment,"This patient-reported context identifies the location as a railway embankment without implying any mechanism, severity, or condition. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The environment term remains unchanged, matching Railway embankment (environment) 285155000. The phrasing does not shift the concept toward a broader embankment or a different railway environment."
1156225006,Gleason score by largest nodule method (observable entity),Gleason score (LNM),LNM is a common abbreviation for largest nodule method; the entry defines the observable as the Gleason score by this method. Category is Observable entity. The abbreviation matches SCTID 1156225006’s concept because it refers specifically to the largest nodule method. A general Gleason score (parent) or other method variants (siblings) do not fit. The abbreviation does not add attributes; it is a clinically accepted shorthand.
703436002,Measurement technique with detection limit equal to or less than 0.005 mIU/L (qualifier value),Addendum: detection limit ≤ 0.005 mIU/L for the measurement technique,This entry provides an addendum noting the technique’s detection limit at or below 0.005 mIU/L. No extraneous attributes are added. Category: Qualifier value. It corresponds exactly to SCTID 703436002. Using a generic detection-limit qualifier or a different numeric limit would be less precise. The wording is a documentation-style restatement of the LoD concept with the specified threshold.
285128009,Personal environment (environment),Immediate personal environment,The phrase refers to the person's immediate surroundings but remains within the scope of 'personal environment' without specifying a location or characteristics. This fits the Environment category and maps best to Personal environment (285128009). The inclusion of 'immediate' does not introduce an attribute beyond proximity and does not alter the underlying entity; it remains the personal environment rather than a child like home or occupational environment. Parent or sibling concepts are less precise.
411725002,Merluccius merluccius diagnostic allergen extract (product),Challenge reagent: Merluccius merluccius diagnostic allergen extract,"“Challenge reagent” is a clinically acceptable synonym for a diagnostic allergen extract used in testing, and the species is specified as Merluccius merluccius. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This maps cleanly to SCTID 411725002, not to a parent generic allergen extract and not to therapeutic extract siblings. No procedural attributes (dose, route, result) are added that would change coding."
309169007,Tracheal biopsy specimen (specimen),Tissue specimen: tracheal biopsy,"The entry describes a tissue specimen obtained by biopsy from the trachea. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 309169007 is appropriate because it denotes a specimen created by biopsy of the trachea. Using a generic tissue specimen code or a procedure code would be less accurate. No mention is made of specific tracheal components (mucosa, cartilage), avoiding child concepts."
442122004,"Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar 3,15:-:1,6 (organism)","Organism: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 3,15:-:1,6","The entry lists an organism name and specifies Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar 3,15:-:1,6. No additional attributes (specimen source, positivity, clinical syndrome) are added; this is a label for the organism. It falls under the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy, and SCTID 442122004 is the precise match for this serovar. Higher-level parents omit the serovar, and sibling concepts would indicate different serovars. The 'Organism:' prefix is contextual but does not alter the taxonomic identification."
242404005,Fall due to impact against pedestrian conveyance (event),Assessment: fall consequent to collision with a pedestrian conveyance.,"This assessment describes a fall consequent to a collision with a pedestrian conveyance, which is equivalent to impact against such a conveyance. The main concept is a fall event due to impact against a pedestrian conveyance; additional attributes are not introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Event. 'Collision with' is interchangeable with 'impact against,' making SCTID 242404005 the most accurate code. Parent-level falls lack the cause, and sibling mechanisms involving other objects are not reflected."
160393005,Family history: Menstrual disorder (situation),Chart review: family history shows menstrual disorder,"The chart review confirms family history of menstrual disorder without adding details like subtype or relative. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 160393005 is most appropriate, denoting family history: menstrual disorder. Parent concepts are too general, and child or sibling concepts would require specificity not present. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
427208006,Product containing proteinase inhibitor (product),Hospital supply: protease inhibitor-containing medicinal product,"This describes a medicinal product within hospital supply that contains a protease inhibitor; no additional attributes such as formulation or intended use are provided. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The most precise match is 'Product containing proteinase inhibitor' because the defining feature is the ingredient role. Parent product groupers that include all enzyme inhibitors are too broad, while child concepts specifying particular subclasses or named ingredients would be too narrow. The phrasing preserves the correct product-level granularity."
217298003,Jump from burning apartment (event),ED note indicates jump from burning apartment.,"Emergency department documentation of 'jump from burning apartment' identifies the exact event without added qualifiers. It is an Event and the accurate code is SCTID 217298003. Using a parent such as 'Jump from burning building' would sacrifice apartment specificity, while siblings like 'Fall from burning apartment' or 'Apartment fire exposure' would change the mechanism. The phrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and remains uniquely codable."
224660001,Mews bungalow (environment),Care setting: mews bungalow residence,"This entry denotes the care setting as the patient’s “mews bungalow residence,” which still identifies the environment type Mews bungalow (SCTID 224660001). The care setting context does not change the coded entity; it remains a dwelling subtype. Choosing a parent like “Bungalow (environment)” would omit the mews qualifier, and siblings such as “Mews house” indicate different structures. Therefore, the Environment concept Mews bungalow is the correct, most specific code."
64922006,Cenchrus purpureus (organism),Organism identified: Cenchrus purpureus,"The entry communicates that the organism identified is Cenchrus purpureus, maintaining focus on the species in the Organism category. The phrase 'identified' is contextual and does not add attributes like cause or severity. SCTID 64922006 is appropriate because it names the exact species rather than a higher-level taxon or a sibling species. No specific cultivar or subspecies is indicated, avoiding child concepts. The text remains a pure species designation."
702832002,Child and adolescent neurology clinic (environment),Children's and adolescent neurology clinic,"This wording specifies a neurology clinic for children and adolescents, matching the environment concept of a clinic with a specialty and defined age groups. Category: Environment. SNOMED CT code 702832002 fits precisely as it encompasses both children and adolescents. A parent such as Neurology clinic lacks the age definition, while siblings limited to pediatric-only or adolescent-only do not reflect both populations. The phrase 'children's' is a standard synonym for 'child', keeping the intent unchanged."
705844005,Hernia surgical mesh (physical object),Intraoperative item: hernia surgical mesh,"The entry identifies a device used intraoperatively, specifically hernia surgical mesh, keeping the focus on the physical object. It maps to SNOMED CT 705844005 (Physical object) without adding implantation status, site, material, or brand. Procedural or finding concepts are not appropriate here, and more granular device subtypes are not implied."
223589002,Indonesia (geographic location),Confirmed country designation: Indonesia,"This confirms that the designated country is Indonesia. The concept type is a geographic location under the Location hierarchy. The phrasing avoids travel, citizenship, or sublocation details. Parent concepts would be too generic, and no child or sibling entities are mentioned. Indonesia (geographic location) is the precise code."
1352941001,Union for International Cancer Control stage IV:25 (qualifier value),UICC stage IV noted,"The concept captured is UICC stage IV, articulated as a noted stage group. It belongs to the Qualifier value category. The text avoids specifying site, edition, clinical vs pathological staging, or substage detail, so it should be coded to the general UICC Stage IV qualifier. A broader parent (UICC stage grouping) would lack specificity, and siblings like AJCC Stage IV or UICC stage II/III are incorrect. No IVA/IVB details are present, ruling out child concepts. Therefore, SCTID 1352941001 is the appropriate match."
328667006,Gluten-free brown unsliced bread (product),Diet order: gluten-free brown unsliced bread,"This is a nutrition order specifying a product: gluten-free brown unsliced bread. The SNOMED CT category remains Product because the ordered item is the product itself. SCTID 328667006 is the precise code since the order explicitly requires gluten-free, brown, and unsliced attributes. Coding to a parent like 'gluten-free bread' or a sibling like 'gluten-free brown sliced bread' would not reflect the exact order. The 'Diet order' context does not add clinical attributes; it indicates usage."
223377003,Gran Canaria (geographic location),Place name: Gran Canaria,"‘Place name’ indicates a toponym, and Gran Canaria is the island’s name. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The code 223377003 exactly fits the island Gran Canaria without implying a larger region or a smaller subdivision. Using a parent like Canary Islands would be too general, and child entities such as Las Palmas de Gran Canaria would be too specific. The label does not introduce attributes, only clarifies the type of term."
424203006,"Physical therapy education, guidance and counseling (procedure)",Physical therapy-related patient education and guidance,"This phrase emphasizes patient education and guidance in the context of physical therapy, squarely within the PT education/guidance/counseling domain. It is a Procedure. SCTID 424203006 is the most accurate match due to explicit PT focus. A broad patient education code would be insufficiently specific, and child concepts for particular PT techniques or topics would be too narrow. No additional attributes are introduced."
308619006,War pensions report (record artifact),War pensions report available for review,"Availability is contextual, yet the artifact referenced is a war pensions report. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. War pensions report (record artifact) [308619006] is the most accurate code due to the explicit scheme-specific report. Generic parent report codes are too broad, and siblings (e.g., benefit claims or insurance reports) are inappropriate. The availability note does not alter the document type or introduce clinical attributes."
346632009,Phenylketonuria bread and bread rolls (product),Nutrition supply: phenylketonuria bread and bread rolls,"This supply listing names the PKU-targeted bread and bread rolls, corresponding to the product concept. Category: Product. The supply context does not alter the product coding. It is more specific than a general PKU dietary supply and does not suggest other PKU items or only one type of bakery product."
698276005,First stream urine specimen (specimen),Initial stream urine specimen,"Main concept: urine specimen collected from the initial stream. Attributes: specimen = urine; portion = initial stream. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The precise mapping is 698276005 First stream urine specimen, as “initial stream” is clinically equivalent to first stream. Mapping to a parent like Urine specimen is less precise, while siblings such as Midstream urine specimen or First morning urine specimen would incorrectly imply a different portion or a time-of-day attribute. No extraneous details are introduced."
441531000124102,Standard enteral formula (product),On standard enteral formula,"This statement conveys that the patient is receiving the standard enteral formula, but the focus remains on the product identity rather than a procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The ‘standard’ descriptor ensures mapping to SCTID 441531000124102, as it excludes specialized formulations. Although it reflects clinical use, it does not imply additional attributes beyond being the standard product. Generic parents lack the specificity, and modified child/sibling concepts are not suggested."
789132002,Mirrored visible image uncorrected flipped horizontally and vertically (record artifact),Uncorrected mirror reversal across horizontal and vertical in the image.,"“Mirror reversal across horizontal and vertical” conveys both axes are mirrored, and “uncorrected” confirms the artifact persists in the image. The main concept is a visible image artifact; the SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 789132002 fits best because it encodes an uncorrected mirrored visible image flipped horizontally and vertically. Parent codes lack the specific transformation, and sibling artifacts like rotations or inversions without mirroring do not apply. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym."
705687005,Oral wound dressing (physical object),Supply item: oral wound dressing,"This represents a supply item and identifies it explicitly as an oral wound dressing, fitting the Physical object category. The precise code is Oral wound dressing (physical object) [705687005]. The supply context does not introduce clinical attributes (e.g., cause, timing, composition), so it remains distinct from broader wound dressing concepts and from narrower siblings (periodontal, medicated)."
362005005,Entire cardiopulmonary circulatory system (body structure),Whole cardiopulmonary circulation (anatomic),"The entry frames the cardiopulmonary circulation as an anatomical entity and states it is “whole,” a synonym of “entire.” This maps to a Body structure and is precisely SNOMED CT 362005005. More general parents like “entire cardiovascular system” include systemic circulation; narrower siblings like “pulmonary circulation” or “cardiac structure” omit necessary components. The synonymic phrasing does not change the intended scope."
736185009,Donor-organ preservation/transport system gas cylinder regulator (physical object),Donor organ preservation transport system gas cylinder control regulator,"The entry describes a control regulator for a gas cylinder in the donor organ preservation transport system. Attributes include device type (control/pressure regulator), medium (gas cylinder), and system context (donor organ preservation/transport). Category: Physical object (device). SCTID 736185009 is the correct code because the device is a regulator associated with the donor-organ preservation/transport system. A parent that omits system context would be too broad, and sibling devices like flow control valves or monitors are distinct. “Control regulator” is a synonym indicating regulation function without expanding scope."
364612004,Presenting part palpable vaginally (observable entity),"On vaginal examination, the presenting part can be palpated.","The phrase indicates palpation of the presenting part via a vaginal examination, which is the defining feature of 'Presenting part palpable vaginally' (SCTID 364612004). The main concept is palpability of the fetal presenting part with the attribute of the route (vaginal); category is Observable entity. More general parent concepts do not capture both palpability and vaginal route, and sibling concepts that negate palpability or specify the type of presenting part would be inaccurate. 'Can be palpated' is a clinically equivalent expression of 'palpable' without introducing additional attributes, maintaining the correct code."
462280009,Line-powered electromechanical operating table system (physical object),"Operating room table system, electromechanical, AC line","The device is an operating room table system that is electromechanical and powered by the AC line. Category: Physical object. ‘AC line’ equates to mains/line power, maintaining equivalence with the preferred term. This excludes battery-powered or manual/hydraulic tables, making 462280009 precise. Parent concepts without the power/mechanism specificity and sibling concepts with alternative configurations are less suitable."
244973006,Structure of bulbospongiosus of male (body structure),Gross anatomy term: male bulbospongiosus muscle,"The entry is an anatomical naming of the male bulbospongiosus muscle, which corresponds directly to SNOMED CT 244973006 (Body structure). It contains no added features like pathology, laterality, or timing. The explicit male sex sets it apart from the sex-unspecified parent and from the female counterpart. “Muscle” here is a clinically equivalent synonym for the body structure."
242014006,Dry drowning (event),Discharge summary: dry drowning,"This entry specifies “dry drowning” in a discharge summary setting, without adding attributes like fatality, severity, or intent. The clinical concept is the Event ‘dry drowning,’ best coded as Dry drowning (event), SCTID 242014006. Choosing the parent Drowning (event) would be less precise, and siblings like Near drowning (event) would represent different circumstances. The discharge context merely frames documentation and does not modify the coded event."
444351000124104,Non-essential amino acid free formula (product),Switched to non-essential amino acid free formula,"A change in product selection to a formula without non-essential amino acids. Main concept: product; switch context is incidental. SNOMED CT category: Product. The wording directly conveys the NEAA-free property and thus maps to SCTID 444351000124104. Parent categories like generic formula products do not capture the specific composition, and siblings with different amino acid profiles would miscode the statement. No added attributes such as route or patient age are included."
48708001,Angiostrongylus cantonensis (organism),Angiostrongylus cantonensis (organism),"The entry explicitly states the organism Angiostrongylus cantonensis, reinforcing the taxonomic nature of the concept without adding clinical attributes. It belongs to the Organism hierarchy, and SCTID 48708001 is the exact species code. More general or specific variants (genus, larva, egg) are not indicated, and no disorder/causation wording is present, so this code is the precise match."
258426009,Placental membrane tissue specimen (specimen),Specimen: placental membrane tissue,"This phrasing identifies a specimen and specifies its source as placental membrane tissue. The main concept is the specimen type, not a procedure or diagnosis, and it belongs to the Specimen hierarchy. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term, thus mapping directly to “Placental membrane tissue specimen” (SCTID 258426009). It does not broaden to general placenta specimens nor narrow to a particular sub-membrane (e.g., amnion/chorion), keeping it aligned with the exact concept rather than parent or child codes."
227209000,Clams canned in brine (substance),Canned seafood: clams in brine,"While prefixed by a category label, the substance specified is clams in brine in a canned form, which exactly corresponds to clams canned in brine. Main concept: substance; attributes: clams, brine, canned. SNOMED CT category: Substance. SCTID 227209000 is the most precise code. Coding to a generic “canned seafood” parent would be inaccurate, as the text specifies clams and brine. No additional attributes beyond the concept are introduced."
96246003,Product containing benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (product),Emergency cart medication product: benzodiazepine receptor antagonist,"This entry situates the product in an emergency cart context but the coded concept remains a medicinal product classified as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, mapping to SCTID 96246003. No additional attributes such as dose, route, or specific active ingredient are introduced. Selecting a general product parent would ignore the class specificity, while choosing a child (specific named ingredient product) would be too narrow given the wording. The term “medication product” is a clinically equivalent synonym for a medicinal product."
1269128004,Irinotecan hydrochloride anhydrous (substance),Ingredient: irinotecan hydrochloride anhydrous,"The term 'Ingredient' identifies the substance present, explicitly irinotecan hydrochloride in an anhydrous state. This fits the Substance hierarchy and maps to SCTID 1269128004. Parent or sibling concepts differing by salt or hydration would not match the exact wording, and medicinal products would inject formulation attributes. The phrasing maintains equivalence to the preferred term without adding new clinical details."
264017007,Entire hilum of lung (body structure),Target anatomy: lung hilum,"This entry identifies 'lung hilum' as the anatomy of focus, employing a context label without altering the anatomical concept. 'Lung hilum' is synonymous with 'hilum of lung' and refers to the entire structure, aligning with Entire hilum of lung (SCTID 264017007) in the Body structure hierarchy. No laterality or component-level details are added, so children like left/right hilum or siblings like root of lung are excluded. The phrase remains strictly anatomical and codable to the intended concept."
770366003,Product containing thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (product),Medication: thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor,"This entry conveys a medication classified by its active pharmacologic role as a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, matching the product-level concept 770366003. The SNOMED category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It does not specify a particular agent, formulation, dose, or route, so it avoids mapping to child concepts. It exceeds parent-level generality by naming the specific enzyme inhibition class. The term 'medication' here is a clinically equivalent synonym for product and does not alter code selection."
213998008,Train hit by falling object - pedal cyclist injured (event),"Patient reported: ""I was injured as a bicyclist when a train got hit by a falling object.""","A patient-reported phrasing indicating injury to a bicyclist during an event where a train was hit by a falling object still represents the same external cause event. ‘Bicyclist’ is equivalent to ‘pedal cyclist,’ and ‘got hit by a falling object’ matches the mechanism. This maps to SNOMED CT Event 213998008. It does not add specifics beyond the scope of the concept. Parent categories or siblings lacking either the train mechanism or the cyclist role would be less precise."
1156575007,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of ampulla of Vater at proximal surgical margin in pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen (observable entity),Primary ampullary malignancy present at proximal surgical margin of PD specimen.,"The statement confirms presence of a primary ampullary malignancy at the proximal surgical margin of a PD (pancreaticoduodenectomy) specimen, which is an Observable entity. SCTID 1156575007 is the precise match because it represents presence of primary malignant neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater at the proximal margin in a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen. Parent concepts lacking the margin or specimen details are too broad, and child/sibling concepts describing other margins or histologic subtypes would be incorrect. ‘PD specimen’ is acceptable shorthand for pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen; ‘ampullary malignancy’ equals malignant neoplasm of ampulla of Vater."
184823006,Special activities med report (record artifact),Special activities medical report (record artifact),"The parenthetical clarifies the artifact class without altering the underlying concept. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This maps to SCTID 184823006 because it is exactly a medical report for special activities. A generic medical report parent concept would under-specify the purpose, and sibling concepts such as medical certificates or special duty letters are different document types. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent and adds no status or contextual attributes."
721981007,Diagnostic studies report (record artifact),Diagnostic tests report,"The wording conveys a report generated from diagnostic tests, functionally equivalent to a report of diagnostic studies. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and Diagnostic studies report (record artifact) [721981007] fits best. Because the entry avoids specifying test type or context like preliminary/final, child concepts with modality specificity are not justified. Parent-level report concepts are too broad, so this mid-level concept is the precise match without introduced attributes."
1381523008,Entire blood vessel within urinary bladder (body structure),Urinary bladder blood vessel,"The phrase refers to a blood vessel that is located in the urinary bladder. The only explicit attribute is the anatomical location (urinary bladder), with no specification of type (artery, vein, capillary), number, or pathology. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This exactly matches the concept Entire blood vessel within urinary bladder (SCTID 1381523008) because it denotes a blood vessel situated within the bladder. A parent concept like Blood vessel would be too general (missing the bladder location), and child concepts such as Vesical artery or Bladder vein are overly specific and not stated. Using the term 'urinary bladder blood vessel' is a clinically standard synonym that preserves the semantics without introducing new attributes."
288572000,Toilet on general practice premises (environment),Toilet located in the general practitioner’s office building,"This longer description specifies a toilet and locates it within the GP’s office building, matching general practice premises. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. No new attributes such as accessibility, usage, or temporal details are introduced. It excludes other settings and is more specific than the parent concepts of toilet or general practice premises alone, pointing to SCTID 288572000."
371901002,Medication administered less than 72 hours before percutaneous coronary intervention (situation),Medication taken within the prior 72 hours before percutaneous coronary intervention,"The phrase indicates a medication was taken within the prior 72 hours before PCI, which corresponds to the Situation concept SNOMED CT 371901002. The elements are medication administration and a <=72-hour timeframe linked to PCI. Parent concepts lacking PCI linkage or sibling concepts with alternate time windows or drug specificity would not capture this exact scenario. 'Taken' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'administered' in this context and does not change the coding intent."
261068009,Dorsovolar approach (qualifier value),Approach: dorsovolar,"This documentation line specifies the procedure approach as dorsovolar, without referencing anatomy, laterality, or other modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the exact code is Dorsovolar approach (qualifier value) SCTID 261068009. A parent like Approach - access would not capture the specific dorsovolar nature, and siblings that only specify dorsal or volar would be less accurate. The term 'Approach' directly maps to the attribute, and 'dorsovolar' is the clinically standard descriptor, making the qualifier value the correct selection."
371534008,Summary report (record artifact),Concise summary report document,"The phrase denotes a document that is a concise summary report, which is a direct representation of the summary report artifact. Category: Record artifact. The chosen code is Summary report (record artifact), SCTID 371534008. Descriptors like “concise” do not introduce a different type of document; they simply describe the summary characteristic. No discharge, visit, imaging, or operative context is implied, making parent or sibling concepts less fitting."
2331000205106,Non-contact infrared patient thermometer (physical object),Medical noncontact infrared patient thermometer,"The device is a medical thermometer for patients using infrared and designed for noncontact measurement. Main concept: thermometer device; attributes: infrared and noncontact; context: medical/patient. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). This exactly matches SCTID 2331000205106 because it includes the essential qualifiers. A parent concept would omit either non-contact or patient specificity, and child concepts that specify measurement site or contact would be inaccurate. 'Noncontact' is a synonym for non-contact and does not alter code selection."
411908009,Castanea sativa pollen specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Castanea sativa pollen specific diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry explicitly identifies a diagnostic allergen extract prepared from Castanea sativa pollen. The attributes stated are the source (Castanea sativa pollen) and intended use (diagnostic), which together define a product rather than a substance or a clinical finding. In SNOMED CT this belongs to the Product category. This matches SCTID 411908009 precisely, as it denotes the specific diagnostic allergen extract for sweet chestnut pollen. A generic parent like “diagnostic allergen extract” would omit the species-specific source, and a sibling or child such as an immunotherapy extract or a skin prick-specific reagent would introduce therapeutic intent or modality details not present here. The wording is a direct synonym of the fully specified name and does not alter code selection."
223959004,Scottish island (geographic location),Referral destination: clinic on a Scottish island,"The location concept that needs coding is “Scottish island.” It belongs to the Geographic location category in SNOMED CT. SCTID 223959004 conveys the correct scope—an island in Scotland without specifying which one. The clinical referral context does not add attributes about the island such as region or size. Parent concepts would be too broad, and named island children would be too narrow; hence 223959004 is appropriate."
708073008,Minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility test technique (qualifier value),MIC susceptibility test technique,"This phrasing uses the standard clinical abbreviation MIC to denote the minimum inhibitory concentration method as the susceptibility testing technique. It describes a technique (Qualifier value) rather than performing the test or reporting a result. SNOMED CT 708073008 is the exact match. Parent categories of susceptibility techniques are too broad, while children such as specific MIC submethods are not mentioned. Sibling techniques like disk diffusion are excluded by the explicit 'MIC' terminology."
223597009,Afghanistan (geographic location),Afghanistan [location],"The bracketed descriptor clarifies that Afghanistan is being referenced as a location, keeping the concept within SNOMED CT’s geographic location hierarchy. The main concept is Afghanistan, with no added properties like residency or events. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). Parent or sibling concepts are less precise; child concepts (e.g., specific Afghan provinces) are not introduced. The bracket does not alter the intended code."
285047009,Able to use contact lenses (finding),Can use contact lenses,"The main concept is capability to use contact lenses, which aligns with the Clinical finding 'Able to use contact lenses' (SCTID 285047009). There are no added qualifiers such as type of lens, duration, comfort, or laterality, so the concept is precise. Broader parent concepts related to general ability are less specific, and siblings indicating actual wear behavior or inability would be inaccurate. 'Can use' is a direct synonym of 'able to use' and does not alter code selection."
26400009,Labyrinthotomy via transtympanic route (procedure),Operative note: transtympanic labyrinthotomy,"Within an operative note context, the phrase 'transtympanic labyrinthotomy' states a labyrinth incision performed via the tympanic membrane route. This is a Procedure and corresponds to 'Labyrinthotomy via transtympanic route'. The context tag does not introduce timing or outcome; it just situates the concept. Parent concepts without the specified route or siblings with different approaches (e.g., transmastoid) would be less accurate given the explicit transtympanic wording."
421673004,Ophthalmic contact lens radius measuring device (physical object),Ophthalmic device – contact lens radius measurer,"The entry names an ophthalmic device that functions to measure the radius of contact lenses, exactly matching SNOMED CT 421673004. The primary concept is a Physical object (device) for contact lens radius measurement. Parent categories such as ophthalmic device are too broad; siblings like lensometers or keratometers measure different targets. It avoids specifying a subtype (e.g., radiuscope), keeping to the general concept required by 421673004 without added attributes."
430228002,Specimen from tunica of testis (specimen),Specimen source: testicular tunica,"Stating the source as the testicular tunica is a clear specification that aligns with SNOMED CT 430228002 (Specimen from tunica of testis) in the Specimen category. There are no added attributes like technique or tunica layer subtype. Therefore, child concepts are not implicated, and broader or different anatomical source concepts would not capture the tunica specificity present in the wording."
306263000,Referral to pediatric neurologist (procedure),Referral to pediatric neurology specialist,"This phrasing specifies the referral destination as a pediatric neurology specialist, which is clinically equivalent to a pediatric neurologist, and documents a procedural action. The main concept is referral; the destination is a pediatric neurologist in role terms, with no additional attributes included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the most precise code is “Referral to pediatric neurologist (procedure)” (306263000). Alternatives like “Referral to specialist” are overly broad, and “Referral to neurologist” lacks the pediatric qualifier. It is not a consultation event, so encounter codes would be incorrect."
1335722006,History of amputation of index finger (situation),Documented history of index finger amputation.,"The entry unmistakably conveys that there is a recorded past event of amputation affecting the index finger, representing a Situation with explicit context. It should be coded as 1335722006 History of amputation of index finger (situation), not as a procedure or anatomical absence, because the context is historical documentation. The statement does not add attributes like laterality or timing, so child codes requiring those are not applicable, and the index finger specification rules out parent concepts for general finger amputation history."
223751009,Regions of Japan (geographic location),Service location: regions of Japan,"The main concept is the location “regions of Japan,” designated as a service location. Category: Geographic location. This should be coded to SCTID 223751009, which captures Japan’s regional subdivisions collectively. The parent concept “Japan” is too broad, and any specific region child is too narrow and not mentioned. The service context does not change the semantic scope of the location."
611241000124101,Functioning carbon monoxide detector in residence (finding),Carbon monoxide alarm functioning in residence,"The entry states that a carbon monoxide alarm is functioning and specifies the setting as residence, directly matching Clinical finding 611241000124101. Using 'alarm' as a synonym for detector is clinically equivalent. Parent concepts that omit functional status are too general, and siblings covering absent or nonfunctional detectors would not fit the documented functional state."
242897002,Blow with knee (event),Knee used as striking surface,"This entry specifies that the knee served as the striking surface in a blow, with no mention of target or other qualifiers. It belongs to the Event category and matches SCTID 242897002. Parent concepts like Strike (event) fail to capture the instrument specificity, and siblings such as Blow with fist or Kick with foot are mismatched. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term and justifies the same code."
416489008,Structure of articular pillar of cervical vertebra (body structure),Structural description: articular pillar of cervical vertebra,"Main concept: a description of the structure known as the articular pillar in a cervical vertebra without additional qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The best match is 416489008, which denotes the structure of the articular pillar of cervical vertebra. Parent concepts would be too general, and children specifying vertebral level or side are not suggested. Sibling concepts like facet joint or articular process would be inaccurate for this wording. The phrasing preserves the same anatomical concept without changing semantics."
223516004,Djibouti (geographic location),Facility country field: Djibouti,"The entry indicates a facility’s country field value as Djibouti, which remains a straightforward location designation and maps to SNOMED CT “Djibouti (geographic location)” SCTID 223516004 in the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. It does not assert residence, travel, or other statuses—only the country name. Using a parent like “Country” is less specific, and city-level siblings would be incorrect. Thus, 223516004 is the precise match."
80516009,Blood group antigen Davis J (substance),Erythrocyte antigen Davis J,"Using 'erythrocyte antigen' with Davis J refers to the same RBC blood group antigen substance. The category is Substance and SCTID 80516009 is the precise match. The entry does not introduce presence, result, or condition attributes, so it does not shift to a Clinical finding. The parent blood group antigen is less specific, and other named erythrocyte antigens are siblings and incorrect. The synonym is clinically equivalent to Davis J blood group antigen."
703069008,Nurse practitioner clinic (environment),Nurse practitioner–run clinic,"Describing the clinic as 'run' by nurse practitioners maintains the same environmental meaning as the preferred term, focusing on the setting defined by NP operation. The main concept is the environment, with no added attributes such as service type, urgency, or purpose. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This is more specific than generic clinic environments and does not drift into sibling concepts like walk-in clinic or primary care clinic. It is not an encounter or organizational role concept; it strictly denotes the care environment."
262103002,Structure of right atrial accessory pathway (body structure),Right atrial accessory conduction pathway (anatomic structure),"This entry names the anatomical structure: a right atrial accessory conduction pathway. It is a Body structure. SCTID 262103002 is the correct, most specific code for the structure as stated. More general parents lack laterality/atrial specification; sibling terms (left atrial or AV accessory pathway) add attributes not included; and child concepts with sublocations are overspecified. The synonym ‘conduction pathway’ is equivalent to ‘accessory pathway’ in anatomical usage."
328303004,Homocystinuria food (product),HCU medical formula (food),"The phrase identifies a medical formula food for homocystinuria (HCU), which remains within the medical food product category. Category: Product. It aligns with SCTID 328303004 because it indicates homocystinuria-targeted food without specifying infant use, flavor, or other formulation details that could suggest a narrower child concept. Parent ""medical formula"" or generic medical food would be too broad, and sibling concepts for other metabolic conditions are not applicable. The term ""medical formula"" here is a clinically safe synonym for medical food."
467537005,Chamber-decompression cardiac catheter (physical object),Heart chamber decompression catheter,"Using 'heart' in place of 'cardiac' is a clinically equivalent synonym. The device is explicitly a catheter intended for decompression of heart chambers, fitting the Physical object category. SNOMED CT 467537005 is the most precise code because it captures the decompression function for cardiac chambers; parent concepts lack that specificity, and chamber-specific or feature-specific sibling concepts are not indicated."
468277001,Dental impression tray material (physical object),Impression tray-making material used in dentistry,"The wording specifies the material used to make impression trays in dental practice, i.e., a Physical object. The term ""tray-making material"" is a clinically equivalent synonym that still focuses on material for trays, not the device or the impression agent. There are no subtype attributes, so it does not map to a child. General parents like dental materials are less specific; therefore 468277001 is preferred."
609099007,Microscopic cytologic examination of smear of specimen from surgical wound prepared using Papanicolaou technique (procedure),Laboratory test: surgical wound smear cytology via Papanicolaou technique,"This lab-test phrasing denotes cytology on a smear taken from a surgical wound using the Papanicolaou technique, which corresponds to SCTID 609099007. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It specifies the smear cytology, the specimen source (surgical wound), and the Pap technique. Parent concepts that generalize smear cytology or omit the Pap method are less precise, and sibling concepts for non-surgical wounds or gynecologic Pap tests would be mismatched given the explicit surgical wound source."
425081007,Subfamily Chordeilinae (organism),Catalog entry: Chordeilinae (subfamily),"This denotes Chordeilinae at the subfamily rank for cataloging, which aligns with the SNOMED organism concept Subfamily Chordeilinae (SCTID 425081007). Main concept: organism taxon (subfamily). SNOMED CT category: Organism. A parent family would be too broad, and a child genus/species would be too specific. The cataloging context does not alter the taxonomy level or introduce extraneous attributes."
297595005,Melanesian language (qualifier value),Melanesian language group,"This wording conveys the language grouping/value as Melanesian language, consistent with the qualifier concept. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It does not name a particular language or a broader parent, so siblings/parents/children would be less appropriate. SCTID 297595005 is the correct selection."
42882002,"Hypodermic spray, device (physical object)",Needle-free injector device (hypodermic spray),"This statement refers to a needle-free injector, further specified as hypodermic spray, which is synonymous with a jet injector device. Category: Device (physical object). The focus is solely the physical object; there is no mention of a procedure, medication, or indication. Parent device categories are too broad, while sibling devices like needles or syringes are inconsistent with “needle-free.” The parenthetical ensures alignment with hypodermic spray, keeping the code selection precise for SNOMED CT 42882002."
223830000,Lemnos (geographic location),Lemnos,"The entry names the specific geographic place 'Lemnos', which is a unique, named island. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This maps precisely to Lemnos (geographic location) SCTID 223830000 because it refers to the exact place by its canonical name without adding scope, qualifiers, or broader regional terms. Parent concepts like 'Island (geographic location)' are too general, and sibling locations (e.g., other islands) are different places. No clinical attributes are introduced; it remains a pure location reference."
445950006,Cystoscopy and removal of calculus of urinary bladder (procedure),Cystoscopy with removal of intravesical calculus,"Intravesical means within the bladder; the entry states cystoscopy with removal of a stone inside the bladder. This is a Procedure. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 445950006 since it includes cystoscopy and bladder calculus removal. Parent concepts covering only one part or siblings specifying method/approach (like open removal or lithotripsy) are not indicated, and 'intravesical calculus' is a clinically equivalent descriptor."
225695008,Applying cartella shield (procedure),Cartella shield application carried out,"‘Carried out’ indicates the procedure was completed and ‘cartella shield application’ identifies the exact action, with no additional attributes introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Code 225695008 is the most precise match as it specifies applying the cartella shield. Parent categories of general device application are insufficiently detailed, and sibling procedures for alternate shields are inaccurate. The phrasing is an accepted narrative synonym and retains code equivalence."
411798008,House dust (Hollister-Stier Labs) diagnostic allergen extract (product),House dust allergen diagnostic extract — Hollister-Stier,"This concise entry names a diagnostic extract for the house dust allergen with the Hollister-Stier manufacturer, matching the branded diagnostic product. The main concept is the product; attributes present are allergen (house dust), diagnostic purpose, and manufacturer. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It is more specific than generic house dust diagnostic extracts and not aligned with siblings such as immunotherapy extracts or other brands. The phrasing is a safe synonym that preserves code selection."
764800009,Structure of nail bed of left thumb (body structure),Left first digit nail bed,"‘First digit’ of the hand is the thumb, so 'Left first digit nail bed' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of 'nail bed of left thumb.' The main concept is a specific anatomical structure and laterality. SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This selection is more precise than parent structures and avoids mismatch with siblings like 'right first digit nail bed.' No procedure or condition is introduced, keeping it purely anatomical."
714010003,Product containing ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitor (product),Current medication category: glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor,"The entry classifies a current medication under the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor category, equivalent to ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitor products. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. SCTID 714010003 is precisely matched by this mechanism-based classification; no ingredient, dose, route, or indication is specified. Parent categories would be too general, and child concepts naming specific drugs are not triggered. The synonym used is clinically safe and equivalent."
442522008,Montenegro (geographic location),Country name: Montenegro,"This records the country name Montenegro, aligning with the country-level geographic location. Main concept: Montenegro as a geographic entity. Category: Location. The code Montenegro (geographic location), SCTID 442522008, fits precisely. Parent concepts are broader; children (localities within Montenegro) are not indicated. The label “Country name” is a contextual header and does not change the coding intent."
715036001,Does not take medication (finding),States they do not take medication.,"This is a patient-stated finding that they do not take medication. It falls under Clinical finding and matches 'Does not take medication (finding)' SCTID 715036001. There are no added attributes such as refusal, nonadherence, therapy status, or reasons for not taking medication. It therefore should not be coded to concepts like 'No current drug therapy' or 'Noncompliance.' The phrasing is a straightforward synonym of the preferred term, retaining the same semantic meaning."
90311000119107,Vaccination declined by caregiver (situation),Caregiver refusal of immunization,"The entry uses 'immunization' synonymously with 'vaccination' and 'refusal' synonymously with 'declined,' retaining identical clinical meaning. It is a Situation with explicit context, specifically 'Vaccination declined by caregiver.' Because the actor is the caregiver, it is more precise than the parent concept and distinct from patient-declined siblings. No extraneous details are included."
20587003,Paternal age (observable entity),Age of the father (observable),"Explicitly framed as an observable, this phrase refers to the measurable demographic attribute of the father's age, which is 'Paternal age' (SCTID: 20587003). No values or qualifiers are introduced. Parent concepts like 'Age' are too broad, and sibling concepts (maternal age) or qualifiers (advanced) would misrepresent the entry, confirming 20587003 as the precise mapping."
223572005,North and central Asian country (geographic location),Geographic location: North and Central Asian country,"The entry explicitly states the location type and the subregional classification, mapping to SCTID 223572005 in the Geographic location (Location) hierarchy. It is more specific than generic country or Asian country parents and not as narrow as specific named country children. It avoids sibling classifications restricted to a single subregion. The prefix “Geographic location:” is contextual but does not add attributes to the concept; the codable entity remains the country in North and Central Asia."
391181005,Early neonatal death (event),Early neonatal death of the newborn,"This entry explicitly ties the early neonatal timing to the death of a newborn, mapping to SNOMED CT 391181005 Early neonatal death (event). The category is Event. No cause or other attributes are present. The parent concept of neonatal death is less specific without ‘early,’ and sibling/related concepts like late neonatal death, infant death, or perinatal death do not match the specified timing and scope. Thus, the precise event code 391181005 is appropriate."
411134002,Fragrance mix (product),Registered item — Fragrance mix (product),"A registered item labeled “Fragrance mix (product)” denotes the product identity as defined by SNOMED Fragrance mix (product). It does not add attributes like concentration, brand, or application. SNOMED CT category: Product. Parent-level entries are too general, and sibling concepts (e.g., fragrance single-ingredient products or patch-test-specific variants) are not suggested. The wording is fully consistent with the target concept."
701211010000109,Immunoglobulin G4 antibody to Blattella germanica (substance),Specific immunoglobulin G4 to Blattella germanica,"This denotes an IgG4 antibody with specificity to Blattella germanica, clearly functioning as a substance/analytical target name. SNOMED CT category: Substance. 'Specific' indicates antigen specificity and does not introduce result or severity information. Parents without target or subclass are too general, and siblings (e.g., IgE or IgG non-G4 to Blattella germanica) would not match the subclass explicitly stated."
32157002,Cathepsin B (substance),Cathepsin B protein,"This identifies Cathepsin B as a protein, which is accurate because it is an enzymatic protein. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The term does not imply genetic (gene-level) concepts or measurements; therefore SCTID 32157002 is the exact match. Parent concepts like 'protein' are nonspecific, and sibling enzymes under the cathepsin family are distinct substances."
117191001,Ribosomal ribonucleic acid of Mycobacterium intracellulare (substance),Mycobacterium intracellulare ribosomal ribonucleic acid substance,"This explicitly states the substance nature of ribosomal RNA from Mycobacterium intracellulare, aligning with the SNOMED Substance category. It does not add subunit, detection, or gene attributes. SCTID 117191001 is the precise code. Parent concepts like generic rRNA are too broad, while child concepts with 16S/23S specification are too narrow. The addition of the word 'substance' reinforces category without changing semantics."
258992005,Millimeter/hour (qualifier value),Speed unit for this measure: mm/h,"This specifies the speed (rate) unit as mm/h, equivalent to millimeter per hour. Category: Qualifier value. While it references speed conceptually, the entry still only expresses the unit of measure, fitting SCTID 258992005. Broader speed-unit parents or siblings like mm/s or m/h would be inaccurate because the wording clearly sets millimeters per hour."
87283008,Clidinium bromide (substance),Analyte designation: clidinium bromide,"The term frames clidinium bromide as an analyte target, which still denotes the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; SCTID 87283008 accurately identifies clidinium bromide. No diagnostic finding, administration, or product detail is asserted, so mapping to a finding or product concept would be inappropriate. The analyte role does not change the underlying substance identity."
736784004,Distance between molar teeth (observable entity),Observable: intermolar distance,"The entry denotes the observable parameter under consideration—intermolar distance—without any additional qualifiers. It falls under the Observable entity category and aligns with SCTID 736784004. Parent concepts describing generic oral cavity observables would be too broad, while child/sibling concepts narrowing to maxillary or mandibular intermolar distance would introduce unmentioned attributes. “Intermolar distance” is a direct synonym and does not change the coding intent."
20889005,"Genetic marker, function (observable entity)",Genetic marker function variable,"The word 'variable' denotes the data element/observable under consideration, namely the function of a genetic marker. This corresponds precisely to 'Genetic marker, function (observable entity)' SCTID 20889005. No additional attributes such as presence, abnormality, or timing are introduced. It is not better mapped to a procedure or to 'Gene function,' since the subject remains the genetic marker."
464710000,Thoracic suction system (physical object),Supplies include: chest suction system,"This entry lists the chest (thoracic) suction system as a supply item, which still identifies the physical object. Category: Physical object. The contextual phrase 'Supplies include:' does not add clinical attributes or transform the concept into a procedure or finding. The anatomical focus prevents mapping to parent general suction systems or sibling devices intended for other regions."
1365805009,Photographic intraoral direct image of frontal view with tongue thrust by patient (record artifact),Photographic intraoral direct straight-on view image; artifact caused by patient tongue thrust,"“Straight-on view” is a clinically acceptable synonym for frontal view, and the entry explicitly states a direct intraoral photographic image and the artifact cause (patient tongue thrust). This is a Record artifact concept. SCTID 1365805009 is the best match because it combines the imaging specifics with the identified artifact. Parent concepts missing view/technique specificity or sibling artifacts of different causes or mirror images would not align. The synonyms used do not introduce new attributes."
734124007,Knee joint synovial fluid (substance),Knee synovia (joint fluid),"‘Synovia’ equals synovial fluid, and the parenthetical 'joint fluid' clarifies the synonym without changing meaning. The knee site is specified, which aligns with SNOMED CT Substance 734124007. A parent concept omits the knee location, and other joint-specific siblings do not apply. No procedural, specimen, or finding attributes are present, keeping this entry uniquely codable to the knee joint synovial fluid substance."
216343002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, factory building (environment)",HPI notes the event occurred in a factory building (accident).,"The history documents that an accident occurred in a factory building, which corresponds precisely to SCTID 216343002. The main concept is place-of-occurrence within the Environment hierarchy. It is more precise than a generic accident location and does not align with siblings such as 'farm building' or 'warehouse' since a factory building is specified. No additional attributes beyond location are included."
432864003,Specimen from large intestine obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Large bowel FNA biopsy specimen,"‘Large bowel’ is a standard synonym for ‘large intestine’, and ‘FNA biopsy specimen’ identifies the sample derived via fine-needle aspiration. This is a Specimen-category concept. SCTID 432864003 exactly matches this combination of site and method. Using a parent concept would omit the method, and using sub-site children (e.g., colon-specific) would not align with the broader ‘large bowel’ wording. Siblings that involve non-FNA techniques are inappropriate. The synonym does not add or alter attributes and remains semantically equivalent."
445233004,Percentage span of neoplasm consisting of stroma (observable entity),Observable: percentage stroma in neoplasm,"The entry explicitly signals an observable measuring the percentage of stroma within a neoplasm. The main concept is the percent composition of tumor stroma. Category: Observable entity. This aligns with SNOMED CT 445233004 by naming stroma percentage as the observable target without including site, tumor type, method, or a numeric result. Parent observables for general tumor composition are broader, and sibling observables measuring other components or ratios are different. The explicit mention of ‘observable’ underscores the data element type without changing the semantic content or code."
773444007,Pancreatic surgery care plan (record artifact),Pancreatic surgery care plan noted,"The phrase indicates the presence of a pancreatic surgery care plan, which is a documented Record artifact, mapping to Pancreatic surgery care plan (SCTID 773444007). The term 'noted' merely indicates that the artifact is recognized in documentation and does not add timing or other clinical attributes. Broader care plan artifacts are less specific, and procedure-related situations or consents are different artifact types, so the given concept is the most precise match."
102395001,Paragliding (qualifier value),Paragliding mentioned by patient,"This patient-reported mention identifies the activity 'paragliding' and introduces no attributes such as cause, severity, or timing. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is to the Qualifier value 'Paragliding' (102395001). Using broader parents would lose specificity, and selecting a sibling like 'Skydiving' would be incorrect. The reporting context is neutral and does not alter code selection."
721921005,Nurse discharge concise summary (record artifact),Nursing discharge synopsis (concise),"“Synopsis” is a synonym for summary, and the entry explicitly marks it as concise, with nursing indicating the authoring domain. This is a Record artifact and matches SCTID 721921005. A parent concept like discharge synopsis without the concise qualifier or nursing author would be less specific, and sibling physician-authored summaries are excluded. The synonym choice preserves equivalence and does not change the intended coding."
256369007,Leukocytes apheresis (product),"Record lists ""apheresis white blood cells""","The quoted term refers to a product of white blood cells (leukocytes) obtained through apheresis. The main concept is a blood product, and the phrase does not describe a procedure. This corresponds to SNOMED CT Product 'Leukocytes apheresis (product)' (256369007). Parents such as 'Blood product' lack specificity, and children or siblings for platelet or plasma components or leukocyte subsets are not indicated. The synonym 'white blood cells' is clinically equivalent to 'leukocytes' and does not change code selection."
81262005,Blood group antibody Gy^a^ (substance),Problem list: anti-Gy(a) blood group antibody,"The entry labels the specific antibody identity on a problem list as “anti-Gy(a) blood group antibody,” which is the Gy(a) antibody. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the exact match Blood group antibody Gy^a^ (substance), SCTID 81262005. A parent concept is too broad, and sibling concepts (other antigen antibodies) would be incorrect. The wording is a contextual annotation but preserves the precise antibody identity without adding extra attributes."
256859009,Fetal adrenal medulla (substance),Fetal adrenal medulla material,"This phrase conveys the material/substance representing the fetal adrenal medulla and should be coded under the Substance category as “Fetal adrenal medulla (substance)” SCTID 256859009. It avoids implying a body structure, specimen, or modified derivative like extract or antigen. Alternatives such as “Adrenal medulla (substance)” (missing fetal qualifier) or body structure concepts are less appropriate given the explicit material context and fetal attribute."
736285004,Hyperlipidemia clinical management plan (record artifact),Plan: hyperlipidemia clinical management,"This concise notation identifies a plan focused on clinical management of hyperlipidemia, clearly referencing the plan artifact. The SNOMED category is Record artifact. SCTID 736285004 is the correct mapping as it denotes a hyperlipidemia clinical management plan. Parent concepts are too general, while siblings concerning other conditions or plan types do not match. The synonymic phrasing does not introduce additional attributes such as interventions, severity, or timing."
218003007,Accident caused by road scraper (event),EMS handoff: road scraper accident,"The EMS handoff note names an accident and specifies the causative equipment as a road scraper. The main concept is an accident; the attribute is the identified cause. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This is specific to a road scraper and does not introduce other attributes like timing or severity, so SCTID 218003007 is the most appropriate code over related but more general machinery accident concepts."
110905003,Nasopharyngeal cytologic material (specimen),Nasopharynx cellular material specimen,"This entry states a cellular (cytologic) specimen from the nasopharynx, aligning with SNOMED CT 110905003. The main concept is a specimen; attributes identified are cytologic nature (cellular material) and nasopharyngeal source. Category is Specimen. It is not simply a nasopharyngeal specimen of any type, nor a tissue or swab; it specifically indicates cytologic material, making it the precise match. ‘Cellular material’ is a standard synonym for cytologic material and retains the same coding scope."
399693002,Total parotidectomy specimen (specimen),"Parotid gland, total resection specimen","This indicates a specimen composed of the parotid gland after total resection. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. “Total resection” is clinically equivalent to “total parotidectomy,” ensuring precise mapping to SCTID 399693002. It avoids partiality, laterality, or additional structures, thereby excluding siblings like partial or radical parotidectomy specimens and parents like generic parotid gland specimens."
1091881000119100,Objective tinnitus of right ear (finding),Objective R ear tinnitus,"Using 'R ear' is a common clinical abbreviation for the right ear, and 'objective tinnitus' denotes examiner-audible tinnitus. The main concept is objective tinnitus of the right ear. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This is an exact fit for SCTID 1091881000119100 because it captures both the objective nature and laterality. A parent concept lacking laterality would be less specific, while siblings such as left ear objective tinnitus or subjective right ear tinnitus would not match. The abbreviation does not introduce new attributes; it preserves the intended laterality."
286825000,Tends to humiliate others (finding),Patient states they tend to humiliate others.,"This is a patient-reported admission of a tendency to humiliate other people, preserving the exact behavioral finding. It introduces no additional attributes (e.g., frequency beyond tendency, severity, or target specifics). Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 286825000 remains the precise code, representing the humiliation tendency. Parent findings would be nonspecific, and siblings (ridicule, bullying) denote different behaviors. The reporting source (patient) does not alter the concept."
242357007,Accidental ingestion of panther mushroom (event),Mistakenly ingested Amanita pantherina,"The entry identifies an accidental ingestion event of a specific species, Amanita pantherina, which is the panther mushroom. This is in the Event category. The code 242357007 precisely fits because it is defined for accidental ingestion of panther mushroom. Using the scientific name is a clinically acceptable synonym that does not alter the concept. Sibling disorder codes for poisoning are excluded since no clinical outcome is stated; broader ingestion events lacking species specificity are less precise."
1260274001,Caregiver food and/or nutrition priority for subject (observable entity),Caregiver priority: food/nutrition for subject,"This phrasing labels the observable variable as a caregiver-determined priority concerning food/nutrition for the subject. The main concept remains the same: caregiver prioritization in the food/nutrition area. No assessment value is asserted. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, as this is a defined question/field. SCTID 1260274001 fits best because it is specific to caregiver food and/or nutrition priority. A parent concept lacking the food/nutrition domain would be too broad, and a sibling focusing on other domains would be inaccurate. 'Food/nutrition' is a clinically equivalent synonym to 'food and/or nutrition' without changing the meaning."
85417000,Product containing autonomic agent (product),Med list: autonomic agent product,"In a medication list, the phrase denotes a medicinal product of the autonomic agent class, fitting SNOMED CT 85417000. The category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. No route, strength, or specific drug is identified, so this is not a child concept. It is more precise than a parent concept because it specifies the autonomic agent class. The context (med list) does not alter the underlying product concept."
429277008,History of laryngectomy (situation),Has had laryngectomy,"This entry conveys that the patient has undergone laryngectomy at some prior time, with no additional qualifiers. The main concept is the past laryngectomy; the explicit attribute is historical context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. The correct code is History of laryngectomy (situation), SCTID 429277008. It is not the procedure occurring now and does not specify current anatomical absence or extent, so parent or child concepts are less appropriate. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to “history of laryngectomy.”"
1381462001,Radiotherapy prior to lymphadenectomy (situation),Radiotherapy administered prior to lymph node dissection,"Formal documentation language confirms radiotherapy was administered before lymphadenectomy (synonym: lymph node dissection). The primary concept is the sequence of procedures, which is a Situation. SNOMED CT 1381462001 fits best, whereas parent concepts like 'radiotherapy prior to surgical procedure' are less precise, and singular procedure codes do not capture the prior-to relationship. No additional attributes are introduced."
122611008,Specimen from lung obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopic biopsy (specimen),"Histology request: lung, fiberoptic bronchoscopy biopsy specimen","This histology request text clearly describes a lung specimen collected via fiberoptic bronchoscopy biopsy. Main concept: specimen; site: lung; method: fiberoptic bronchoscopic biopsy. Category: Specimen. It maps directly to SCTID 122611008. More general parent codes lack the specified method, and alternative sites (bronchus) or technical variants (transbronchial, cryobiopsy) are not stated."
773599001,Hemophilia care plan (record artifact),Hemophilia plan of care documented,"The entry indicates that a hemophilia-focused plan of care has been documented, which is the same artifact as a hemophilia care plan. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, reflecting a documentation element rather than a disease or procedure. SCTID 773599001 fits best because it encodes the hemophilia-specific care plan. A parent like generic Care plan (record artifact) would be too broad, and more specific children or siblings (e.g., subtype-specific care plans or treatment plans) are not supported by the wording. The addition of “documented” describes the record status but does not change the artifact type, keeping the mapping to the same concept."
288625009,Does not use automatic language (finding),Does not produce automatic speech,"This wording specifies that the individual does not produce automatic speech, clinically equivalent to not using automatic language. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 288625009 is most precise because it encodes the nonuse of automatic language. Broader or different communication findings (e.g., general lack of speech) are not implied, and sibling concepts indicating use of automatic language do not match. No new attributes are added."
284353008,Offshore installation (environment),Offshore marine installation,"This entry reiterates the environment as an offshore installation, with 'marine' reinforcing the sea context without adding specificity. It remains an environment concept in SNOMED CT. No attributes like industry, purpose, or event are introduced. More general parents (marine environment) would be overly broad, and children like oil-specific platforms would be narrower than the wording. The most accurate code is 284353008 Offshore installation (environment)."
421567009,Near point ruler (physical object),Near-point ruler,"This is a hyphenated orthographic variant of 'near point ruler' referring to the same instrument. The concept remains a Physical object and maps best to SCTID 421567009. The hyphen does not introduce any new attributes or specificity. Parent concepts such as 'ruler (physical object)' are under-specified, and sibling or branded subtypes are not indicated, making the exact near point ruler concept the most accurate selection."
122661004,Specimen from pancreas obtained by partial pancreatectomy (specimen),Resected pancreas specimen (partial pancreatectomy),"This denotes a resected pancreatic specimen and clarifies the resection was a partial pancreatectomy. The main concept is a specimen; attributes: pancreas and partial pancreatectomy. It aligns with SNOMED CT Specimen 122661004. A generic resection specimen without 'partial pancreatectomy' would be less specific, and more specific procedures like distal pancreatectomy or Whipple are not stated. 'Resected' is a clinically equivalent synonym indicating surgical removal consistent with partial pancreatectomy."
280473008,Structure of primary upper central incisor tooth socket (body structure),Anatomy: primary upper central incisor tooth socket,"The contextual lead-in 'Anatomy:' does not change the core identification of the anatomical Body structure: the tooth socket of the primary (deciduous) upper (maxillary) central incisor. This matches SCTID 280473008 by specifying dentition, arch, tooth type, and that the part is the socket. Broader parent concepts (e.g., tooth socket, upper incisor socket) lack the central incisor and primary detail, while siblings such as lateral incisor socket or permanent central incisor socket would contradict the wording. The entry avoids laterality and any pathologic or procedural attributes, maintaining a pure structural reference."
174250002,Open laser destruction of lesion of rectum (procedure),Open transabdominal laser destruction of lesion of rectum,"This specifies an open transabdominal approach with laser to destroy a rectal lesion. Attributes: approach (open, transabdominal), method (laser), action (destruction), site (rectum). Category: Procedure. SCTID 174250002 is the most precise match since it captures open laser destruction of a rectal lesion; the mention of transabdominal is consistent with open access but does not change the core concept. Parent codes lacking laser/open specificity or siblings like endoscopic/transanal laser destruction would be incorrect. Excision variants are not appropriate because the action is destruction, not cutting removal."
108150009,Anterior segment of eye endoscopy (procedure),Endoscopic visualization of anterior segment of eye,"The entry describes visualization by endoscope of the eye’s anterior segment, with no mention of treatment or substructure detail. It falls under the Procedure category and maps accurately to SCTID 108150009. It is more specific than general ocular endoscopy and avoids targeting narrower regions, thus parent or child/sibling codes are less accurate. “Visualization” is an acceptable synonym conveying the endoscopic examination without altering the intended concept."
6521000146101,Sphingopyxis witflariensis (organism),Sphingopyxis witflariensis species,"The entry identifies the species-level designation Sphingopyxis witflariensis, indicating a specific organism taxon without implying presence, source, or pathogenicity. This is an Organism concept in SNOMED CT. The explicit species name makes SCTID 6521000146101 the most precise code. Generic parents such as Sphingopyxis (organism) are too broad, and no strain-level details are present to move to a child concept. There are no sibling species references; the wording remains strictly the named species."
773685005,Hepatitis A virus genotype IIIA (organism),Hepatitis A virus genotype III-A,"A hyphenated form 'III-A' is a notation variant that still denotes genotype IIIA. Main concept: HAV organism at genotype IIIA. Category: Organism. This maps to SNOMED CT 773685005 without ambiguity. Parent HAV organism is too general, and sibling genotypes (IA, IB, II, IIIB) do not match. The punctuation does not change the clinical meaning or introduce additional attributes."
1204485003,"Island in region of Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands (geographic location)",Travel destination: island in the Pitcairn archipelago,"This notes a destination as an island in the Pitcairn archipelago, the group of Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno. The main concept is the geographic island within that specific archipelago. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. It maps to SCTID 1204485003 because it expresses the island-in-region class; coding to the archipelago itself or to any specific island would be less precise relative to this wording. 'Archipelago' is a synonymous descriptor for the same island group."
271514008,Sternal bone marrow specimen (specimen),Specimen label reads “sternal bone marrow”,"The entry indicates that the specimen label identifies the material as sternal bone marrow, confirming the specimen nature and sternal source. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This directly aligns with SCTID 271514008, avoiding collection method or other qualifiers. Parent concepts are less specific (no site), and children/siblings adding method (aspirate, biopsy) or different anatomy would be inappropriate. Labeling context does not introduce extra attributes affecting the code."
277203001,Suprasellar extension (qualifier value),Suprasellar extension acknowledged in chart,"The entry conveys that suprasellar extension is acknowledged, which is a documentation context around the same qualifier value. Category: Qualifier value. It maps to SNOMED CT 277203001. Broader extension qualifiers or different anatomical directions do not fit the wording. The phrase remains clinically equivalent to “suprasellar extension.”"
89484009,Structure of lumen of colon (body structure),Anatomy under review: colon lumen,"This statement designates the colon lumen as the anatomical entity under review, without introducing findings or segment information. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It maps to 89484009 Structure of lumen of colon. Broader parents or entire organ references are less specific, and children like lumen of ascending/sigmoid colon are not implied. Sibling structures such as colonic mucosa or wall are not referenced."
285093007,Underground railway line (environment),Environment: underground railway line,"This documentation-style phrase explicitly identifies the environment type as an underground railway line, matching the SNOMED CT concept Underground railway line (environment), SCTID 285093007. The SNOMED category is Environment or geographical location. It avoids adding attributes beyond environment identification. A broader parent like Railway line (environment) would omit the underground qualifier, and siblings like Underground railway station or Subway platform would incorrectly add location subtypes not stated. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
26878008,Death due to trampling (event),Demise due to trampling,"“Demise” is a synonym for death, and the phrase attributes this to trampling, clearly describing a death event caused by trampling. The SNOMED CT category is Event, with SCTID 26878008 providing the precise representation. Using a broader death concept would miss the causal detail, while focusing on trampling injuries would overlook the death outcome. The synonym use does not change intent or add qualifiers, keeping the mapping specific."
161551002,History of urethral stricture (situation),Medical history notable for urethral stricture,"The entry places urethral stricture specifically within medical history, indicating past occurrence and avoiding any additional qualifiers such as treatment or severity. It belongs to the Situation with explicit context category and maps to History of urethral stricture (161551002). Coding to the disorder would misstate the temporal context. Parent concepts for generic urinary history are overly broad, and family history is inapplicable because the statement refers to the patient’s own history. The phrase is a clinically standard way to denote the same situation."
384625004,pT category (observable entity),Review note: pT category referenced in TNM staging,"This follow-up documentation references the pathologic T category within TNM staging, which corresponds to the observable entity SNOMED 384625004. It does not introduce a specific pT value and excludes other components (N/M) and overall stage groups. The phrasing is more specific than a generic T or TNM category and does not fit any child value concept."
121499003,Chloroform measurement (procedure),Chloroform analysis—measurement performed,"This entry asserts that an analysis focused on measuring chloroform was performed, clearly denoting a procedure. It fits the SNOMED CT Procedure category and maps to Chloroform measurement (SCTID 121499003). The wording avoids specimen, method, timing, or result attributes, so it does not correspond to a more detailed child. It also does not present an observable entity; “measurement performed” indicates the action rather than the variable. A generic parent (chemical analysis) would be less specific since chloroform is identified. Therefore, this is a precise, clinically equivalent expression of the concept."
48967004,Plasma cell labeling index measurement (procedure),Plasma cell labeling index analysis,"This describes a procedural analysis to measure the labeling index in plasma cells. It is a Procedure, and SCTID 48967004 is the most precise code since the target cell type and measurement (labeling index) are clearly stated. More general labeling index analyses without cell type are less accurate, and options specifying a marker (e.g., Ki-67) or technique go beyond the entry. The term 'analysis' is equivalent to 'measurement' in this clinical context and introduces no additional attributes."
22029000,Aedes scutellaris (organism),Voucher specimen: Aedes scutellaris,"The voucher specimen is identified as the species Aedes scutellaris; 'voucher specimen' is contextual and does not change the organism concept. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism concept Aedes scutellaris (organism), SCTID 22029000. Parent concepts like Mosquito or Aedes spp. would fail to capture the species name, and siblings would reference different species. No attributes such as life stage or sex are present, maintaining the species-level specificity."
706523009,Vibrator/percussor (physical object),Percussive vibrator,"This concise synonym conveys a vibrator with percussive capability, which is equivalent to a vibrator/percussor as a physical object. The main concept is the device itself, corresponding to SNOMED CT 706523009 Vibrator/percussor (physical object). The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The phrasing does not imply a particular body site, clinical application, or power source, so it remains within the general device concept. Parent device categories are too nonspecific, and siblings like single-function vibrators or percussors are less precise than this dual-function device."
441903006,Specimen obtained by bronchial aspiration (specimen),Bronchial suction aspirate specimen,"This states a specimen obtained via suction (a form of aspiration) from the bronchus, i.e., a bronchial aspirate. It is in the Specimen category and aligns with SNOMED CT 441903006. The use of 'suction' is a common clinical synonym for aspiration and does not alter the method or site implied. It does not introduce extra attributes and remains distinct from siblings like 'bronchial lavage specimen' or 'tracheal aspirate'. Hence, the specific concept is accurately represented."
773443001,Ophthalmic surgery care plan (record artifact),Eye surgery care plan,"This entry denotes a care plan focused on surgery of the eye, aligning with the concept of an ophthalmic surgery care plan. The category is Record artifact, as it represents documentation of planned care rather than the surgery itself. The synonym 'eye' is clinically equivalent to 'ophthalmic', so SCTID 773443001 is the correct match. A generic care plan would be too broad, and procedure-specific or pre/postoperative variants would be too narrow; no additional attributes are introduced in this wording."
773435006,Surgical care plan (record artifact),Surgical plan of care,"‘Plan of care’ modified by ‘surgical’ clearly conveys a documented care plan specific to surgery, retaining the artifact nature. It fits the Record artifact category and is accurately coded as 773435006 | Surgical care plan (record artifact) |. Using Surgical procedure plan would be incorrect because that centers on procedural steps rather than the broader care plan. Parents like Plan of care are too general. The synonym remains semantically equivalent and introduces no additional attributes."
1003642006,Past medical history section (record artifact),EMR past medical history section,"This indicates the Past medical history section within an electronic medical record (EMR). The concept remains a Record artifact section, with the EMR context not changing the section identity. SNOMED CT 1003642006 is precise for Past medical history section. A generalized Record artifact or alternate sections (e.g., Problem list section) would be less appropriate. The EMR reference adds context but no clinical attributes, ensuring unambiguous mapping to the designated section."
223772007,Samar (geographic location),Geographical designation: Samar,"The phrase 'Geographical designation' indicates that 'Samar' is the named geographic location, which matches SNOMED CT 223772007. Category: Geographic location (Location). No roles, subregions, or administrative types are implied, preventing misclassification to child/sibling concepts such as Eastern/Northern Samar or island/province variants. The parent concept is less precise. The synonym does not introduce new attributes and keeps the code selection unchanged."
711234000,Antigen of Alternaria alternata protein (substance),Antigen derived from Alternaria alternata protein,"The wording describes an antigen that is derived specifically from an Alternaria alternata protein, exactly matching the Substance concept 711234000. No clinical finding, test result, or administration detail is implied. Less specific parent concepts (generic Alternaria antigen or fungal antigen) do not constrain to the protein form and specific species, while child/sibling concepts would name a single component or refer to extracts. Thus, this entry is a precise, clinically safe synonym for the concept."
415780000,Unit of viral analysis (qualifier value),Result units: viral analysis,"The entry presents a result metadata line indicating that the units pertain to viral analysis, i.e., the unit category used for virology results. It conveys a Qualifier value without adding a particular unit or numeric data. SCTID 415780000 is the correct match. A generic unit parent is too broad, and choosing a specific unit (e.g., IU/mL) or related observables (e.g., viral load) would be misaligned with the wording. The synonym is clinically equivalent."
271861000,Fluid in peritoneal cavity (finding),Radiology: intraperitoneal fluid identified,"This radiology context entry records that intraperitoneal fluid has been identified, which equates to fluid within the peritoneal cavity, a Clinical finding. No attributes regarding type, cause, or quantity are provided. Therefore, more specific concepts (e.g., 'Ascites', 'Hemoperitoneum') are not justified, and broader non-peritoneal-specific parents are too vague. The precise match is 'Fluid in peritoneal cavity (finding)' (271861000)."
736392006,Bronchoscopy care plan (record artifact),Bronchoscopy care plan confirmed,"This states confirmation of the bronchoscopy care plan, but the central concept remains the existence of the care plan artifact. No procedure performance or intent is described. Category: Record artifact. The exact code is 736392006 Bronchoscopy care plan (record artifact). Using the parent Care plan (record artifact) would lose bronchoscopy specificity, and siblings like Bronchoscopy (procedure) or Bronchoscopy planned (situation) do not fit because the statement pertains only to the documented care plan."
215800005,Crushed between ship and wharf (event),"Patient statement: ""crushed between ship and wharf""","The content captures a patient-reported description of the event, maintaining the exact mechanism (crushing) and the specific objects (ship and wharf) without adding timing, severity, or injury details. This is an Event and should be coded as Crushed between ship and wharf (event), SCTID 215800005. Statements implying different structures (e.g., pier, dock) or vehicles (boat) would map to sibling concepts. The quote and label do not change the core concept or code selection."
365794002,Finding of serum cholesterol level (finding),Chart contains a finding of serum cholesterol level,"The entry reflects the presence of a clinical finding for serum cholesterol level in the chart, avoiding abnormality or specific results. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, with 365794002 as the most precise match. Broader parents lack serum specificity, and more specific children/siblings (high/low levels, different analytes or specimens) are not indicated. Documentation context does not alter the underlying concept."
216438005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, dock (environment)",Environmental context of event: dock,"The entry frames the location as the environmental context, specifying 'dock' without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 216438005 is the exact match since it encodes a dock as the place-of-occurrence. Parent categories lack specificity, and siblings such as shipyard or loading dock denote different environments. This paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the target concept."
223375006,Georgia (geographic location),Prior residence: Georgia,"The entry encodes the place name “Georgia” in the context of prior residence, without clarifying whether it is a state or a country. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. Georgia (geographic location) [223375006] is the appropriate concept, as the statement lacks the jurisdictional cues needed for child concepts. The parent concept would be overly broad. The phrasing maintains the same location value without adding attributes that change code selection."
396443005,"Regression involving less than 75 percent of tumor, present (finding)",Regression present: <75% of tumor involved,"The statement conveys two attributes: regression is present and the involvement is less than 75% of the tumor, using the mathematical symbol “<” to mean less than. Category: Clinical finding. This exactly matches SNOMED CT 396443005 by specifying the presence and the threshold. It is more specific than parent concepts that do not state a percentage and excludes sibling concepts that would imply ≥75% involvement or no regression."
167671009,Measurement of feces pH (procedure),pH testing on stool sample,"This entry denotes testing pH on a stool sample, which is the measurement of fecal pH. The main concept is a procedure measuring stool pH. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The specific match is Measurement of feces pH (167671009). Parent concepts that do not specify stool are overly broad, while sibling concepts for urine or gastric pH do not fit. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not introduce additional attributes."
309825002,Spatial and relational concepts (qualifier value),"Spatial and relational concept, qualifier","This documentation-style line denotes a qualifier pertaining to spatial and relational concepts with no further specificity. It belongs to the Qualifier value hierarchy. SCTID 309825002 precisely represents that category. More specific children or lateral attributes are absent, and sibling categories (such as “qualifier value for laterality”) are not mentioned, so the general spatial/relational qualifier concept is the right selection."
700566007,Pressurized full-body orthosis (physical object),Order placed for a pressurized full-body orthosis,"The sentence denotes an order for the specific device: a pressurized orthosis encompassing the full body. As a Physical object, this maps to SNOMED CT 700566007. The ordering context doesn’t introduce purpose or mechanism beyond ‘pressurized,’ so parent and sibling concepts are excluded. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and maintains precise scope."
24178007,Raja rosispinis (organism),Raja rosispinis species designation,"This phrasing denotes the species designation as Raja rosispinis and does not add any clinical or environmental qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the code is Raja rosispinis (24178007). Parent taxa (genus or family) would be less exact than the explicit species designation, and siblings are not referenced. The alternate wording is clinically equivalent and preserves the species-level concept."
406550009,Summary of needs (record artifact),Summary of needs record,"This indicates a record in the chart that constitutes a summary of needs, fitting the record artifact model. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 406550009 is the correct code because the content is a summary of needs rather than a plan, discharge-related document, or assessment procedure. Parent Record artifact would be unnecessarily generic; siblings like Care plan or Patient summary represent different document purposes. 'Record' here simply denotes the artifact format and does not alter the concept."
311903001,Kitchen cleaning material (substance),Kitchen cleaning agent,"“Kitchen cleaning agent” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “kitchen cleaning material,” describing the same generic substance used for cleaning kitchens without specifying chemical type, brand, or incident. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Kitchen cleaning material (substance) [311903001] remains the most precise code. Parent concepts are overly broad, and child/sibling concepts like oven cleaner, degreaser, or dishwashing liquid would add specificity not stated."
309996006,Vascular surgery department (environment),Seen in the vascular surgery department,"The main concept is the vascular surgery department as the care location; the verb 'seen' adds context but does not change the coded concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, and the most precise code is Vascular surgery department (environment), SCTID 309996006. There is no indication of ward vs clinic or outpatient status, therefore child/sibling concepts such as vascular surgery ward or vascular surgery clinic would be less appropriate. It is not a service request or provider specialty code, confirming the environment concept fit."
272305001,Dentine pin (physical object),Tray setup: dentine pin,"A clinical setup context lists the object without implying placement or findings, keeping the reference to the physical item itself. The category is Physical object. The exact SNOMED concept is Dentine pin (272305001). Procedure codes or broader device classes are not indicated and would be less accurate."
16218211000119109,Anal Papanicolaou smear declined (situation),Patient opted out of anal Pap smear.,"The statement indicates the patient chose not to proceed with an anal Pap smear. This is a Situation concept of declining a proposed procedure. “Opted out” is clinically equivalent to “declined” in this context and does not add intent or timing attributes. It is specific to the anal Pap test, distinguishing it from generic Pap or cervical Pap contexts, so SCTID 16218211000119109 is the best fit over parent/sibling concepts."
257667007,Domestic garage (environment),Garage in the patient’s residence,"This phrasing locates the garage within the patient’s residence, which is a domestic setting and therefore aligns with Domestic garage (environment) SCTID 257667007. The concept category is Environment or geographical location. Mentioning the patient’s residence clarifies domestic versus commercial without adding event, timing, or structural attributes, making parent generic garage or sibling commercial garage less precise."
773978009,Endocrinology care plan (record artifact),Assessment/Plan: Endocrinology care plan,"This entry presents the endocrinology care plan within an assessment/plan section, but the artifact itself remains the specialty care plan without extra attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact. The best code match is Endocrinology care plan (record artifact) SCTID 773978009. A parent generic care plan is less precise, and a child tied to a specific endocrine condition is not indicated. The contextual header does not alter the concept's scope."
74105006,Murder by hired killer (event),Murder by hitman,"‘Hitman’ is a common term for a hired killer; coupling it with ‘murder’ clearly expresses murder-for-hire. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This maps exactly to SCTID 74105006 because it specifies murder and the hired nature of the perpetrator. Generic parent concepts lack the hired dimension, while assassination implies motive not present here. The synonym does not introduce new attributes like method or timing."
371542009,Admission history and physical report (record artifact),Admission history and physical note,"The use of 'note' is a common synonym in clinical documentation for a report or document, and the entry specifies it is the H&P created at admission. It belongs to the Record artifact category and corresponds to Admission history and physical report. 'Note' does not imply a different artifact than 'report' in this context; it remains the same document type. A generic H&P note would be less specific (parent), and different notes such as progress or consult notes (siblings) would not fit. The entry maps cleanly to SCTID 371542009."
111051009,"Secondary missile, device (physical object)",Secondary missile–type device,"The entry presents the device's type as a secondary missile, maintaining a focus on the object and avoiding additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). This is a direct match to SCTID 111051009. More general parents like 'missile device' lack the 'secondary' qualifier, and siblings such as 'primary missile device' would not fit. The 'type' phrasing is a synonym that does not alter the code selection."
430337004,Family history of sleep apnea (situation),FH: sleep apnea,"This uses the common clinical abbreviation FH to denote family history and names sleep apnea as the condition, expressing only that the patient’s family has the disorder. The main concept is family history of sleep apnea, with no additional attributes introduced. It belongs to the Situation with explicit context category. The exact match is SNOMED CT 430337004 Family history of sleep apnea (situation). Parent concepts would be overly general, and subtype-specific child/sibling concepts (e.g., obstructive or central) are not indicated by this wording."
787947000,Accidental ingestion of toxic substance (event),Occupational health record: accidental ingestion of toxic substance.,"Despite the occupational health context, the entry describes only the event of accidental ingestion of a toxic substance, without naming the agent or outcomes. The SNOMED CT category is Event, mapping precisely to Accidental ingestion of toxic substance (event). This is more specific than general exposure concepts and does not imply a poisoning disorder. Alternative routes or intentional ingestion are not suggested."
399732002,Specimen from central nervous system obtained by partial excision of tumor (specimen),Specimen from central nervous system obtained by partial excision of tumor,"The entry explicitly states a specimen, the central nervous system as the source site, and that the specimen was obtained via partial excision of a tumor. This aligns directly with SNOMED CT concept 399732002, which is a Specimen category concept describing tissue derived from a CNS tumor via partial excision. More general parent concepts such as “Specimen from central nervous system” lack the method attribute. Sibling or child concepts that specify biopsy or complete excision, or that limit the site to brain or spinal cord, would be less appropriate because the wording here matches partial excision at the broader CNS level. No additional attributes (severity, laterality, timing) are introduced."
790681000000104,Respite care available (finding),Documentation: respite care available,"The entry documents that respite care is available, with no additional qualifiers such as planned, scheduled, or delivered. Category: Clinical finding. The precise match is Respite care available (finding), SCTID 790681000000104, as the content reflects a simple availability finding. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings like ‘respite care not available’ or ‘needed’ are inconsistent with the stated availability."
223524009,Republic of the Congo (geographic location),Congo — Brazzaville,"This dash-separated form is an accepted variant of ‘Congo-Brazzaville’ signifying the Republic of the Congo as a country. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). It is not the sibling Democratic Republic of the Congo and does not represent the child city of Brazzaville itself. No additional attributes are conveyed; the concept remains the national geographic location, matching SCTID 223524009."
223879008,Gloucestershire (geographic location),Present address: Gloucestershire.,"The entry provides an address location and names Gloucestershire; the central concept is the geographic place. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The most appropriate code is Gloucestershire (geographic location), SCTID 223879008. Using parent codes like England would be less specific, and sibling codes for cities or districts would be incorrect unless explicitly stated. The contextual phrase 'present address' does not modify or add attributes to the place itself."
313116006,Advancement technique (qualifier value),Procedure technique field: advancement,"This is a form or EHR field indicating the procedure technique as advancement, with no site or subtype. The main concept is technique qualifier. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. 'Advancement technique' (313116006) is the most accurate code. Parent categories are too generic, and sibling/child techniques would misrepresent the information. The field context does not introduce new attributes."
269280007,Asphyxia by bedclothes or pillow (event),Asphyxiation by pillow or bedding,"The phrase identifies asphyxiation (clinically equivalent to asphyxia) with a mechanism: pillow or bedding (bedclothes). SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 269280007 is the best match because it covers asphyxia attributable to bedclothes or pillow. Using a broader parent like generic asphyxiation would omit the mechanism, and siblings involving other causes (e.g., plastic bag suffocation, strangulation) would be inappropriate. The wording adds no extraneous attributes, keeping the mapping specific and unambiguous."
223509000,North African country (geographic location),"North African country, unspecified","The entry indicates a country in North Africa without specifying which one, exactly matching the class-level concept 223509000. Category: Location (Geographic location). ‘Unspecified’ reflects the absence of a named child entity and does not introduce extra attributes; it confirms that the class concept, not a child, is intended. A broader parent like ‘country’ would omit the North Africa constraint, so this code is the most precise."
448399001,Dental hospital (environment),Care location: dental hospital,"This entry identifies the care location as a dental hospital, focusing strictly on the environment without adding any other attributes. It fits within the Environment or geographical location category. Dental hospital (environment) [448399001] is the correct selection because it denotes a hospital specialized in dentistry as the location. Parent concepts would be overly general, and sibling concepts (Dental clinic environment, dentist office) would not match the described setting. The wording is an equivalent label for the environment."
350075001,Product containing chelating agent (product),Chelating agent–containing medication product,"The entry denotes a medication product whose active ingredient category is a chelating agent, which corresponds to SNOMED CT 350075001. It expresses only the product grouping without introducing attributes like dose form, route, or indication. SNOMED CT category: Product. Using “medication product” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of medicinal product. More general parents would lose the chelating-agent constraint, and children specifying deferoxamine, dimercaprol, succimer, or penicillamine would add unexpressed ingredient detail, making them less appropriate."
739678005,Parents deceased (situation),Parents are deceased; documented,"The phrase confirms the documented status that both parents are deceased. The concept remains a Situation and maps to 739678005. The documentation context is not a clinical attribute that would change coding. Single-parent concepts are too narrow, and broader family death concepts are not specific enough. 'Deceased' is clinically synonymous with 'dead', ensuring equivalence."
409495001,Bioterrorist attack (event),Biological terrorism attack,"The phrase “biological terrorism attack” explicitly describes a terrorist attack using biological means, which is semantically equivalent to “bioterrorist attack.” No additional attributes are specified. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Parent concepts without the biological qualifier or siblings like chemical terrorism attacks do not match the wording. This aligns with Bioterrorist attack (event), SCTID 409495001."
1255328003,Entire primary lower lateral incisor tooth socket (body structure),Whole milk lower lateral incisor alveolar socket,"This entry specifies the whole alveolar socket of the milk (primary) lower lateral incisor, using “whole” to indicate ‘entire’ and “alveolar socket” to denote the tooth socket. Body structure category. SCTID 1255328003 is the precise code because it refers to the entire socket of the primary lower lateral incisor. Concepts for upper lateral incisors, permanent dentition, or partial socket regions are excluded by the wording. “Milk tooth” is a recognized synonym for primary tooth and maintains identical coding intent."
50629008,"Cervical dilatation, function (observable entity)",Observable: cervical dilatation function,"The entry explicitly marks the target as an observable parameter and identifies it as cervical dilatation function. No additional attributes are present. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 50629008 fits because it denotes the functional observable of cervical dilatation rather than a result or procedure. Parent categories (e.g., general observables) are too generic, and sibling/child concepts (findings or measurements) add specificity that is not stated. The wording confirms this is the concept name for an observation field."
186065003,Power of attorney medical report (record artifact),Power of attorney medical report documented,"The entry indicates the presence of documentation that is a medical report related to power of attorney, preserving the artifact identity. Category: Record artifact. SCTID 186065003 is the most precise match, as it combines ‘medical report’ with POA context. Parent medical report concepts lack the POA specificity, and siblings like legal POA forms are different documents altogether."
399499009,Specimen from uvea obtained by complete exenteration of eye (specimen),Specimen of uvea after complete exenteration of eye,"This entry indicates a specimen of the uvea and specifies that it was obtained after complete exenteration of the eye. The concept is a specimen, with attributes of anatomical source (uvea) and acquisition method (complete exenteration). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The concept for uvea specimen obtained by complete exenteration of eye is the correct and most precise selection, as it reflects both source and method. Parent concepts without the method or siblings like enucleation-derived specimens would not match the wording. The phrasing does not introduce additional qualifiers."
293008,Satellite (qualifier value),"Selected value ""satellite""","This indicates that the term chosen is the value ‘satellite’ without attaching it to a finding or disorder. The category is Qualifier value. SCTID 293008 Satellite (qualifier value) is appropriate because the entry reflects a value selection, not a clinical entity. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings like satellitosis or satellite lesion imply clinical morphology or findings, which are not stated."
788105001,Excessive dose of antiserum administered with undetermined intent (event),Antiserum overdosage event; intent not established,"This entry describes an overdosage (excessive dose) of antiserum as an event, with intent not established. The core elements are antiserum, administration at excessive dose, and undetermined intent, situating it in the Event category. SCTID 788105001 directly corresponds to this scenario. Parent concepts are less specific to the substance, and sibling concepts that specify intent categories do not match because intent is unknown. The phrasing does not add severity or outcomes."
1003606003,Medication history section (record artifact),Medication history section,"The phrase explicitly denotes a document section devoted to medication history within a clinical record. The main concept is a record artifact representing the organized section that captures historical medication use. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This is the most precise match for SCTID 1003606003 because it identifies a section focusing on medication history, not a list of current medications or a general record element. Parent concepts like generic record sections are too broad, and sibling concepts such as “Current medications section” or “Medication list section” differ in scope from historical use. No additional attributes are introduced, so it cleanly maps to the specified section concept."
285127004,Polluted environment (environment),Resides in a polluted environment,The entry indicates residency in a polluted environment without implying exposure coding or specifying the pollutant type. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 285127004 is the precise match because it captures the polluted environmental condition. Concepts about exposure events or specific pollution media are not supported by the wording. The residency context does not change the environmental semantic tag or introduce new attributes.
445668006,Telephoned report (record artifact),Report provided by phone,"The phrase indicates the report was provided through the telephone, semantically equivalent to Telephoned report (record artifact) SCTID 445668006. The core concept is a report, and the stated attribute is telephonic provision. This is a Record artifact, not a Procedure, because it represents the documented report rather than the act of calling. Parent concepts like Report (record artifact) would be under-specific, while siblings involving non-telephone modalities would be incorrect. There are no additional attributes such as urgency, content type, or recipient, preserving the precise mapping to the telephoned report artifact."
1003832007,Pasteurella multocida serogroup A (organism),Pasteurella multocida capsular serogroup A,"The phrase explicitly denotes the capsular serogroup A for the species Pasteurella multocida, which is the defining feature of this organism concept. It belongs to the Organism hierarchy, and SCTID 1003832007 exactly matches this description. More general parent concepts lack the capsular serogroup detail, and other capsular serogroups are not referenced here. The entry does not add clinical context such as disease, site, or test method, preserving a pure organism identification."
701777007,Ultrasonic cough stimulation system (physical object),"Cough stimulation system, ultrasonic","The reordered phrase identifies a cough stimulation system with the ultrasonic modality, expressing a physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Despite the inverted order, it remains semantically identical to Ultrasonic cough stimulation system (physical object), SCTID 701777007, because it specifies both function and modality in system form. A parent cough stimulation system without the ultrasonic attribute is less precise, and siblings like ultrasonic devices for unrelated purposes or mechanical cough assist devices are not appropriate. No additional attributes are introduced."
407920000,Gluten-free pasta radiatore (product),Foodservice requisition: gluten-free radiatore pasta,"This requisition specifies ordering gluten-free radiatore pasta. The main concepts are pasta product, radiatore shape, and gluten-free attribute. Category: Product. SCTID 407920000 exactly captures this item. Mapping to a parent would lose either the shape or gluten-free property, and mapping to children (brand or packaging-specific products) would add details not expressed here. The synonym is a simple word-order change and remains clinically equivalent."
445046002,Correspondence section (record artifact),EHR correspondence section,"This denotes the correspondence section within the electronic health record (EHR), which is a contextually equivalent way to refer to the medical record. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and 445046002 Correspondence section (record artifact) is the precise match. A parent like 'EHR section' would be too broad, and sibling sections such as 'Orders section' are not referenced. The EHR qualifier reflects medium but does not introduce attributes that change the concept."
441641000124108,Low carbohydrate enteral formula (product),Tube-feeding plan: Low carbohydrate formula for enteral feeding,"This phrase indicates a product: a low carbohydrate formula intended for enteral feeding. It is semantically equivalent to the preferred term, staying within the Product category and mapping to SCTID 441641000124108. The mention of “tube-feeding plan” is contextual and does not imply a procedure code. Parent concepts are too generic, and sibling/child concepts with additional features (e.g., caloric density or composition beyond carbohydrate) are not expressed."
465268009,Stretcher equipment mount (physical object),Stretcher equipment clamp,"The entry refers to a clamp-type mount for holding equipment on a stretcher. 'Clamp' functions as a synonym for a mounting mechanism and remains within the intended object scope without adding extra attributes. Category: Physical object. The stretcher specificity aligns with SCTID 465268009. A general clamp or equipment mount without stretcher context would be overly broad, and mounts for other patient supports are siblings and incorrect."
736288002,Transient ischemic attack clinical management plan (record artifact),Record shows a clinical management plan for transient ischemic attack,"This sentence points to the existence of a clinical management plan specifically for TIA in the record, which is a Record artifact. SCTID 736288002 precisely encodes a TIA clinical management plan. A generic management plan would lose the TIA specificity, and other artifacts (e.g., care pathways, treatment plans, or follow-up plans) are not stated. The wording maintains focus on the plan artifact, not on the disorder itself."
272222002,Metal hook (physical object),Metallic hook,"“Metallic hook” is a clinically safe synonym meaning a hook made of metal, which is equivalent to “Metal hook (physical object).” The SNOMED category is Physical object. It does not introduce functional use (e.g., surgical or fishing) or specify a metal subtype (which could map to a child material), hence SCTID 272222002 is the most precise. Parent “Hook” lacks the material attribute, and siblings that add use-context or composition beyond generic metal are not indicated."
420278009,New York (geographic location),Relocated to New York.,"The key concept is the destination place “New York.” SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). New York (geographic location) [420278009] best represents this wording, which lacks any city or state qualifier. Choosing a parent concept would be nonspecific, and selecting children/siblings (e.g., New York City) would add detail not present. The relocation context is an action but does not change the geographic location being named."
24231001,Genus Mitsuokella (organism),Mitsuokella,"The entry uses the standalone taxonomic name “Mitsuokella,” which denotes the genus and no particular species or clinical context. The main concept is the organism Genus Mitsuokella, with no added attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is an Organism concept, best matched by Genus Mitsuokella (organism) SCTID 24231001. Parent concepts like “Bacteria (organism)” or family-level taxa are too broad, and species-level children (e.g., specific Mitsuokella species) would be too specific. Using the bare genus name does not change code selection and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
1306631005,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with lips closed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Note: captured a 45-degree extraoral image of the right half of the face; lips closed; centric relation jaw position.,"The note records an extraoral photographic image at a 45-degree view of the right facial half, with lips closed and the jaws in centric relation. This is a SNOMED CT Record artifact, not a clinical finding or procedure. The exact attributes align with the concept, and synonyms like 'image' for 'photograph' and 'jaw position' for 'jaws in centric relation' maintain the same semantics, preventing misclassification to parent or sibling concepts."
276149009,Entire base of phalanx of hand (body structure),"Manual phalanx base, complete","“Manual” denotes the hand, and “phalanx base, complete” specifies the entire base region of a finger phalanx. No laterality, digit number, or other qualifiers are added. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This is a precise fit for SCTID 276149009 because it captures the whole base portion of a hand phalanx without introducing extraneous detail. Parent concepts lacking the “entire” qualifier are less exact, and child or sibling concepts focused on particular digits or specific phalanx levels would not be supported by the general wording used here. The synonym “manual” is standard anatomical terminology for the hand and does not alter the meaning."
242210008,Accident to glider in flight (event),Mechanism description: accident to glider while in the air,"The phrase 'while in the air' is equivalent to the in-flight phase, and it specifies the vehicle as a glider. The main concept is an accident to a glider during flight. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This maps precisely to SCTID 242210008. Broader aircraft accident concepts omit the glider specificity, and siblings for non-glider aircraft or ground-phase accidents are inconsistent with the entry. No causal details, injuries, or severity are added, ensuring accurate event coding."
32193000,Free-standing immunology clinic (environment),Care setting: free-standing immunology clinic,This administrative/documentation phrase identifies the care setting as a free-standing immunology clinic. Main concept: clinical environment. Category: Environment. It is a direct match to SCTID 32193000 due to the explicit specialty and free-standing qualifier. A parent concept would omit the independence attribute; siblings referring to hospital-based settings or different specialties would not be consistent. No additional clinical details are introduced.
413756001,Cardiac rehabilitation declined (situation),Decision recorded to forgo cardiac rehabilitation,"This entry reflects a documented decision to forgo cardiac rehabilitation, i.e., a decline. The attribute is explicit patient decision against the service. It is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 413756001 is the precise code because it represents cardiac rehab declined. Parent concepts for cardiac rehabilitation lack the refusal context, and siblings like “not indicated” or “unable” represent different rationales. “Forgo” is clinically synonymous with “decline” and does not affect code selection."
213774007,"Collision between railway vehicles, passenger injured (event)",Passenger sustained injury in train-to-train collision,"This conveys that a passenger sustained an injury in a collision between trains, which is a synonymous expression for the concept ""Collision between railway vehicles, passenger injured"" (SCTID 213774007; Event). The wording excludes other mechanisms such as derailment and other victim types like driver or pedestrian. No extra attributes are introduced, maintaining exact concept alignment."
1222829006,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III:18 (qualifier value),TNM stage group III (AJCC v8),"The entry specifies TNM stage group III as defined by AJCC version 8, without substage or site detail. The concept is a Qualifier value and corresponds to SNOMED “American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III:18.” Referencing TNM is consistent with AJCC staging, and it does not change the code because no T/N/M components are enumerated. Parent/sibling alternatives (generic Stage III, AJCC II:18, AJCC IV:18) or child options (IIIA/B/C:18) are less appropriate given the exact stage group III under AJCC v8."
275129008,Family history: Ulcerative colitis (situation),FHx: UC,"This entry uses common clinical abbreviations—FHx for family history and UC for ulcerative colitis—to convey the same concept succinctly. The concept is a positive family history of ulcerative colitis, without specifying degree of relation or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 275129008 is exact for family history of ulcerative colitis, whereas broader family history concepts or different diseases would be less appropriate. The abbreviations are standard clinical shorthand and do not change the intended meaning, so they remain codable to the same concept."
264351003,Concert hall (environment),Documentation of place: concert hall,"The entry documents the place as a concert hall, aligning with Concert hall (environment) SCTID: 264351003. Category: Environment or geographical location. The term focuses solely on the environmental location without introducing other attributes. It is more precise than a parent environment concept and not better matched to alternate venue siblings, supporting the exact concert hall environment code."
113730006,Eubacterium callanderi (organism),Eubacterium callanderi confirmed,"The word 'confirmed' indicates certainty of identification but the concept remains the species Eubacterium callanderi. This should be coded to the Organism category, SCTID 113730006. There is no mention of site, infection, or strain, making parent concepts overly broad and siblings incorrect. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent way to express the same organism."
264047009,Intrapulmonary (qualifier value),Intrapulmonary,"The entry explicitly states the location qualifier 'intrapulmonary', meaning within the lungs. The main concept is a location descriptor without any disorder, procedure, laterality, timing, or severity. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The most precise match is SCTID 264047009 Intrapulmonary (qualifier value). Broader parent or sibling concepts such as intrathoracic or pulmonary structure (body structure) are less specific or different categories, and narrower sites like endobronchial or intraalveolar are not indicated by this wording. No additional attributes are introduced."
27360004,Agama agama (organism),Species: Agama agama,"This entry presents the species name Agama agama explicitly. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It directly corresponds to SCTID 27360004, indicating the exact taxon without broader or narrower scope. The label ‘Species’ is contextual but does not add attributes such as causation or severity. Parent genus or other species would not fit because the species is clearly stated."
1141852001,Eosinophil infiltration of pulmonary structure (finding),Eosinophil infiltration of pulmonary structure,"The main concept is the presence of eosinophils infiltrating a pulmonary structure. No additional attributes such as cause, severity, timing, or specific substructures are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This exact phrasing corresponds directly to SCTID 1141852001 and is the most precise match. Parent concepts like generic inflammatory infiltration are too broad, and child/sibling concepts specifying particular pulmonary substructures (e.g., bronchus or alveoli) or disorders (e.g., eosinophilic pneumonia) would be too specific and not supported by the wording."
725637008,Vanilloylglycine (substance),Synonym used: 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoylglycine,"This indicates the use of a synonym that is a systematic chemical name for the same molecule commonly called vanilloylglycine. It conveys only the substance identity, with no added attributes like measurement, formulation, or clinical administration. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Vanilloylglycine (SCTID 725637008) is the precise code. Parent categories would be too broad, and siblings are chemically distinct. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not change the substance concept selection."
109053000,Octreotide (substance),Octreotide (pharmacologic substance),"This entry explicitly disambiguates octreotide as a pharmacologic substance, ensuring the Substance category mapping to Octreotide (substance). Product concepts (e.g., injection, depot, branded forms) would introduce formulation attributes that are not stated. Parent class concepts are broader and would lose specificity. The parenthetical qualifier is a neutral descriptor that preserves the exact substance identity without changing codes."
160352002,Family history: Ear disorder (situation),Family history includes ear disorder,"This documentation places an ear disorder within the family history, without specifying type, severity, or other qualifiers. As a Situation with explicit context, the appropriate SNOMED CT concept is Family history: Ear disorder (SCTID 160352002). It is more precise than a generic family history parent code due to the ear focus and does not drift to children because no specific ear disease is stated."
274349003,Surgical biopsy of esophagus (procedure),Esophageal surgical biopsy,"This phrasing conveys the same concept: a biopsy of the esophagus performed surgically. Key attributes are the site (esophagus) and the action (biopsy) with the surgical approach. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 274349003 is the precise code because it denotes a surgical biopsy of the esophagus. More general parents like “Biopsy of esophagus” omit the surgical aspect, while children specifying endoscopic, thoracoscopic, or needle approaches would be inaccurate here. “Esophageal surgical biopsy” is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not alter the intended procedure."
309976003,Pediatric dentistry department (environment),Pediatric dentistry department (care location),"The phrase identifies the pediatric dentistry department as a care location, aligning with SNOMED CT’s Environment hierarchy. The correct code is Pediatric dentistry department (environment), SCTID 309976003. It avoids extra attributes beyond setting and specialty. Parents like Dental department omit the pediatric dimension, and siblings such as Pediatric dental clinic imply a clinic rather than a department. The added parenthetical clarifies setting without changing the concept."
40767009,Cuclotogaster heterographa (organism),Cuclotogaster heterographa (species),"Including '(species)' clarifies the taxonomic rank without changing the core concept, which is the organism Cuclotogaster heterographa. This cleanly maps to the SNOMED CT Organism concept Cuclotogaster heterographa (organism), SCTID 40767009. Parent concepts at genus or higher taxa are less specific than the species-level designation provided. No host, clinical state, or site is implied, so disorder or finding concepts are not appropriate here."
79594007,Opsanus pardus (organism),"Opsanus pardus, species designation","The phrase indicates a species-level designation, keeping the content limited to the organism’s identity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the most precise match is the Opsanus pardus species concept. Parent taxa (genus/family) would be too general, and no sibling species are mentioned, so the species binomial remains exact."
215454004,"Submersion or drowning due to jumping from burning ship, swimmer injured (event)",Incident narrative: swimmer injured after jumping from burning ship resulting in submersion/drowning,"The narrative form still contains the critical elements: jumping from a burning ship leading to submersion/drowning, with a swimmer injured. This is an Event and corresponds exactly to SCTID 215454004. Broader or alternate external cause concepts (e.g., fall, near-drowning, passenger injured) would misrepresent the details. The phrasing does not add intent, timing, or severity."
396057002,Brilliant green (substance),Brilliant green lab stain,"This phrase refers to the same dye substance Brilliant green used as a laboratory stain, while not describing any specific staining procedure or product preparation. There are no attributes related to strength, route, or combination, so the mapping is to the pure substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, most precisely 396057002. Broader stain concepts or other particular stain substances are not suggested, and child product or medium forms are not indicated. The term 'lab stain' functions as a role synonym without changing the underlying concept."
771596001,Tezacaftor (substance),Drug substance recorded: tezacaftor,"This entry documents tezacaftor as a drug substance, which refers to the chemical entity itself, not a formulated product. The main concept is the single substance tezacaftor. The best SNOMED CT fit is Tezacaftor (substance) SCTID 771596001 in the Substance category. Product-level or combination concepts are excluded by the absence of dosage form, brand, or co-ingredients. 'Drug substance' is a clinically equivalent synonym describing the same entity."
470408007,"High-efficiency filter air cleaner, stationary (physical object)",Wall-fixed HEPA air cleaning unit,"This describes a HEPA-based air cleaning unit that is 'wall-fixed,' i.e., stationary, which is clinically equivalent to a stationary high-efficiency filter air cleaner. The SNOMED category is Physical object (device). It is the most precise code because it combines high-efficiency filtration with non-portability, avoiding mapping to generic air cleaners, portable high-efficiency units, or separate filter components."
242412002,Fall from mountain (event),Witness statement: fall from mountain,"This entry presents a witness-documented event: fall from mountain, which corresponds to SNOMED CT 242412002 (Event). The word ‘witness’ is a documentation context and does not add medical attributes such as timing, injury description, or activity. A parent concept like “Fall (event)” is too general without the mountain specification. Siblings or child concepts for other locations would be misaligned. The core event remains a fall from a mountain, so the code is precise."
216022008,"Collision of aircraft with bird, while in transit, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)",Crew of commercial aircraft injured after aircraft collided with bird while en route,"This text notes a collision between an aircraft and a bird during en route travel (in transit), and the injured individual is a crew member of a commercial aircraft. It matches SCTID 216022008, which is an Event. “En route” is a safe synonym for “while in transit,” and “commercial aircraft” is directly stated. It avoids imprecision of parent concepts like generic bird strikes or unspecified injury parties, and excludes sibling concepts focused on passengers or non-commercial aircraft. No extra details like severity or body part were added."
768590001,Finding of presence of dermatophyte hyphae and spores inside of hair shaft (finding),Report notes dermatophyte hyphae and spores present in the interior of the hair shaft.,"This report narrative explicitly notes dermatophyte hyphae and spores present within the hair shaft interior, making it a positive presence finding with specified organism and site. The SNOMED category is Clinical finding. The wording corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 768590001, which encodes the presence of dermatophyte hyphae and spores inside the hair shaft. Alternative codes for generalized fungal presence or external hair involvement would be less appropriate, and disorder codes would add diagnostic status not conveyed. The narrative remains equivalent to the concept without extra attributes."
1256035007,Surgical margin closest to primary malignant neoplasm in excised specimen of appendix (observable entity),"Tumor-nearest surgical margin, primary malignancy, appendix specimen","This entry conveys the observable: the surgical margin that is nearest to the primary malignancy within an appendix specimen from surgical excision. Attributes expressed are proximity (nearest), primary malignant neoplasm, and appendiceal excised specimen context. It is an Observable entity and maps to SCTID 1256035007. General margin observables or those lacking the ‘primary’ tumor qualifier are less specific, and siblings for other organs or for non-primary malignant neoplasms would be inappropriate. Observables that include margin status or quantitative distances are child concepts not reflected here. The phrasing is a valid paraphrase that maintains exact semantic scope."
1306655000,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with mandible postured forward (record artifact),Documentation artifact—extraoral 45° left facial half photo; mandible anteriorly postured.,"This entry documents an artifact on an extraoral 45-degree left facial half photograph where the mandible is anteriorly postured. The focus is the artifact status in the record, not a diagnostic finding or imaging procedure. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It matches SCTID 1306655000 by specifying the photographic modality, 45° view, left half of face, and the forward (anterior) mandibular posture in artifact context. Parent or broader artifact concepts lacking these details would be less specific, and sibling concepts changing laterality or view would be incorrect. “Anteriorly postured” is synonymous with “postured forward,” preserving exact code applicability."
411935000,Apis mellifera venom specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),In vitro IgE test reagent: Apis mellifera venom allergen extract,"The phrase describes an in vitro diagnostic reagent for IgE testing made from Apis mellifera venom, identifying a diagnostic allergen extract product. The concept is in the Product category. SCTID 411935000 is the most precise code as it captures Apis mellifera venom diagnostic allergen extract. A broader parent would not specify the species, and therapeutic allergen extracts are not applicable because this is explicitly diagnostic. 'In vitro IgE test reagent' is a clinically equivalent synonym for diagnostic allergen extract."
40584000,Uranium (substance),Uranium [chemical],"This entry identifies uranium and clarifies it as a chemical, without implying any particular role, exposure, isotope, or compound. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Uranium (substance) within the Substance category. The bracketed descriptor is a synonymous classification that does not alter the concept selection. Broader or narrower concepts (e.g., Actinide, depleted uranium, uranium oxide) are not warranted by the wording."
399421003,Distance of neoplasm from surgical margin of endocervix in hysterectomy specimen (observable entity),Observable: endocervical surgical margin distance from neoplasm (hysterectomy),"This entry labels the observable measuring the distance from a neoplasm to the endocervical surgical margin in a hysterectomy specimen. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 399421003 precisely represents this measurement. Parent observables that generalize margin site or specimen context are less specific, and sibling concepts that assess margin involvement or other margin locations are inappropriate. The phrasing maintains exact attributes (neoplasm, endocervical margin, hysterectomy) without adding status or values."
11007571000119108,History of amputation of right foot (situation),Prior amputation of the right foot documented,"This line documents that the patient previously underwent amputation of the right foot, clearly a historical event. Attributes are body site (foot), laterality (right), and explicit past context ('prior' and 'documented'). The SNOMED CT category is Situation (history of procedure). It aligns with 'History of amputation of right foot' as it records a past surgical intervention. Mapping to the procedure itself would be incorrect because it is not being performed currently. 'Acquired absence of right foot' focuses on anatomical loss and would not capture the documentation of the prior operation. The use of 'prior' is a common synonym for historical context and does not introduce causation, severity, or extent, keeping coding confined to the situation concept."
304784009,Administrative form (record artifact),Practice administrative form,"This denotes an administrative form used within a practice, maintaining a general administrative purpose without subtype. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps to Administrative form (record artifact) SCTID 304784009. No additional attributes or subtype indicators (e.g., referral, billing) are present, so sibling or child concepts are not a better fit."
41844007,Free-standing geriatric clinic (environment),Delivery site: free-standing geriatric clinic,"This entry specifies the delivery site for care as a free-standing geriatric clinic, which is an environment concept. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The phrase conveys the same meaning as the preferred term without added attributes. SCTID 41844007 is the correct mapping; parent or hospital-based clinic concepts are less specific or incompatible."
726736004,Interpretation of laboratory result (record artifact),Lab result interpretation note,"The term “interpretation note” describes the documentation element that conveys the interpretation of a laboratory result, i.e., a record artifact. The entry avoids introducing attributes such as severity or causation. Therefore, SNOMED CT concept 726736004 (Record artifact) is the precise fit. A generic interpretation artifact without reference to laboratory would be less specific, and concepts representing the actual test result or review procedures are inappropriate because the focus here is the interpretive note."
362068005,Entire venous system of lower limb (body structure),Entire venous tree of the lower extremity,"The phrase describes the full venous branching system within the lower extremity; “entire” ensures comprehensive scope. It is strictly anatomical. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 362068005 is the correct match, aligning with the whole venous system in that region. Parent concepts (general venous system) miss the anatomical site, and siblings (arterial systems) are different in vessel type. Child concepts such as deep or superficial venous trees or regional subsets are too narrow compared to the entire-system statement."
257621007,Harbor (environment),EMS documented scene as harbor,"The documentation indicates the scene is a harbor, clearly pointing to the harbor environment. It is an Environment or geographical location (environment) concept. SCTID 257621007 is exact, as the entry does not reference port operations, marina facilities, or docks. Parent concepts are more general; siblings like port or dock are different settings. The EMS context does not alter the environmental meaning, so Harbor (environment) is the correct code."
83887000,"Rescue vehicle, device (physical object)","Rescue vehicle, device","This entry uses the preferred term structure, naming the physical object as a rescue vehicle and explicitly indicating device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and SCTID 83887000 is the precise match. It does not specify a subtype (e.g., ambulance, fire engine, rescue boat), so child concepts are inappropriate. Sibling concepts like “Emergency vehicle, device” are broader and include non-rescue roles; the inclusion of “rescue” makes this distinct. No extraneous attributes are added."
215974004,Forced landing while landing (event),EMS report: forced landing while landing,"In EMS documentation, the event is a forced landing, and the timing is during the landing phase. Documentation context does not change the underlying Event concept. The explicit phase detail makes this more specific than a generic forced landing and distinguishes it from siblings associated with takeoff or en route operations. Therefore, the correct code is SCTID 215974004."
110808002,Liver and diaphragm (combined site) (body structure),Service request site: liver and diaphragm combined,"The entry identifies the requested site as the combined anatomy of liver and diaphragm. The core concepts are liver and diaphragm; the attribute is their combination as the site. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It correctly maps to the combined site concept since it denotes both organs together without introducing surface, interface, or recess details. Single-organ parents fail to capture the combination, and child/sibling concepts would be overly specific. The contextual phrase 'service request site' does not alter the anatomical meaning or code selection."
1332209006,Dental care plan (record artifact),Dental plan of care,"The wording denotes a plan of care in the domain of dentistry and clearly points to a documented plan artifact. In SNOMED CT, this maps to Dental care plan (record artifact) within the Record artifact hierarchy. It does not introduce timing, severity, or specific dental subspecialties; therefore, neither parent generic care plan nor child or sibling concepts are a better fit. The synonymous structure maintains equivalence to the preferred term, supporting SCTID 1332209006."
397133009,Specimen from vulva obtained by total vulvectomy (specimen),"Tumor board: discussion of the specimen—vulva, total vulvectomy","Multidisciplinary context noting a specimen of the vulva acquired by total vulvectomy. Category: Specimen. The wording maintains exact alignment with 397133009 by including both site and total method. More general parent concepts would be under-specified, and variants like partial or radical vulvectomy specimens would be incorrect based on the phrasing."
110899003,Breast nipple cytologic material (specimen),Nipple cytology specimen of the breast,"The phrase identifies a cytology specimen from the breast nipple, with no extra attributes regarding technique, laterality, or diagnosis. The main concept is a specimen consisting of nipple-derived cytologic material. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Code 110899003 is the most accurate because it encodes breast nipple cytologic material specifically. Parents like Cytology specimen (specimen) are insufficiently specific, and siblings such as Breast tissue specimen or Areolar cytology specimen point to different materials or sites. The synonym structure is clinically equivalent and maintains the intended code."
1285484006,Touch imprint cytology technique (qualifier value),Report states: touch imprint cytology technique,"This indicates a report text capturing the technique as touch imprint cytology, which is inherently a technique qualifier. The most precise mapping is Touch imprint cytology technique (1285484006) under Qualifier value. A parent like Cytology technique is less specific, and sibling techniques are ruled out by the term “touch imprint.” The reporting context does not introduce additional clinical attributes; it simply records the method."
224904005,First floor (environment),Located on the first floor,"This phrase indicates presence at the first floor and does not add any attributes beyond the environmental location. The main concept is the first floor of a building. It fits the Environment or geographical location category and corresponds to First floor (environment), SCTID 224904005. More general location statements would be too broad, and other floors would miscode the concept. The wording is a standard locational expression and is synonymous with 'first floor' for coding purposes."
102584008,Unequal blood pressure in arms (finding),Intake vitals: BP unequal between arms,"The entry reports unequal arm BP during intake vitals, expressing the inter-arm difference without added attributes like direction, severity, or cause. It fits the Clinical finding category and matches 'Unequal blood pressure in arms' (102584008). Parent concepts are too general, and siblings like focused hypertension/hypotension or leg BP differences are not indicated."
216444009,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, mountain (environment)",HPI: place-of-occurrence for accident/poisoning is mountain,"The entry in the history of present illness specifies mountain as the place-of-occurrence for an accident or poisoning, directly matching SCTID 216444009. Main concept: place-of-occurrence; attribute: mountain. Category: Environment or geographical location. The clinical section reference (HPI) does not change coding. Parent concepts lack the specificity, and generic mountain without accident/poisoning context would be incorrect. No sibling location type is mentioned, and there is no indication of a more granular mountain sublocation."
261226001,Blood component (substance),Blood component (unspecified),"This explicitly states the presence of a blood component and clarifies that no particular type is specified. The main concept is a generic blood-derived substance. SNOMED CT category: Substance. Blood component (substance) [261226001] is the exact fit. A parent term would be overly broad, and any child term (e.g., Plasma) would be too specific. Product or procedure concepts are not triggered by this wording; it denotes only the substance concept in an unspecified form."
161659007,History of kidney donation (situation),History of kidney donation,"The entry explicitly denotes a past event where the patient donated a kidney, which is a historical situation rather than an active condition. The main concept is a prior kidney donation; the only attribute conveyed is that it is part of the patient's history. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 161659007 ‘History of kidney donation (situation)’ precisely matches this phrasing because it captures the historical context and the specific organ donated. Broader parents like ‘History of organ donation’ would be less specific, and siblings such as ‘History of liver donation’ or role concepts like ‘Kidney donor’ would not align with the historical focus. This is not a procedure code (e.g., nephrectomy) and introduces no attributes beyond the history of donation."
1365808006,Photographic intraoral direct image of right buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Photographic intraoral direct image of right buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion,"The entry explicitly states a photographic image captured intraorally and directly (not via mirror), localized to the right buccal segment, with the teeth positioned in centric occlusion. The main concept is a documentation artifact, not a clinical finding or procedure. In SNOMED CT this is a Record artifact, precisely matching SCTID 1365808006. More general parent artifacts (e.g., intraoral photograph without laterality or occlusal state) are less specific, and siblings such as left buccal segment or non-direct images would be incorrect. The wording uses the same terminology as the concept and does not introduce new attributes."
277165004,Fresh blood in external ear canal (finding),Otology consult: fresh blood present in the external auditory canal,"During an otology consult, the Clinical finding of fresh blood present in the external auditory canal is documented. The consult context is incidental; the essential content is presence of fresh blood at the external canal site. It avoids attributes beyond the concept and does not imply active hemorrhage or other ear structures. This wording precisely matches the SNOMED concept in question."
787772009,Ingestion of foreign body suspected (situation),Indication: suspected foreign body ingestion,"As an imaging or test indication, this communicates suspected ingestion of a foreign body and maintains uncertainty without adding attributes like anatomical site, severity, or specific object. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The best match is Ingestion of foreign body suspected (situation). Parent concepts such as generic 'suspected problem' are less specific, and confirmed ingestion or site-specific findings would be different codes. 'Indication' simply frames the reason for evaluation and does not change the concept."
69659006,Structure of apex of urinary bladder (body structure),Apex of the urinary bladder,"Adding 'the' does not change the semantics; the phrase clearly identifies the apex portion of the urinary bladder. It cleanly maps to a Body structure and avoids introducing pathology or other attributes. Choosing the entire bladder or different regions (e.g., trigone, fundus) would be inaccurate. This entry is a direct equivalent of the preferred term and maps to SCTID 69659006."
61781009,Argas miniatus (organism),Argas miniatus noted in record,"This documentation statement cites the species Argas miniatus, best coded as the SNOMED CT Organism concept Argas miniatus (SCTID: 61781009). It does not assert any clinical condition, site, or time element, so disorder/finding concepts are not indicated. Parent taxa or sibling species would be less appropriate because the record explicitly names this particular species."
282322005,Ability to stand on one leg (observable entity),Exam item: single-leg stance ability,"As an exam item, it denotes the observable capability to stand on one leg without stating performance or measurements, matching SNOMED CT 282322005. It does not imply a procedure is being performed or a result is being reported. Parent concepts (general standing ability) and sibling procedures (stance tests) are less precise for this wording."
312282000,Leucine crystal (substance),Leucine crystal solid,"This wording denotes leucine as a solid in crystal state, which matches the substance concept. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 312282000 is exact due to the explicit crystalline attribute. No hint of clinical finding, site, or product formulation is present, excluding parent leucine or sibling forms as better matches."
223893001,Northamptonshire (geographic location),"Northamptonshire, England","This expresses the county 'Northamptonshire' with a contextual clarifier 'England'. The main concept remains the county, which is a Geographic location within the Location hierarchy. The correct code is Northamptonshire (geographic location) SCTID 223893001. Mentioning 'England' does not change the entity to a parent concept; it only situates the county geographically. Child concepts like specific districts or sibling counties are not implied, so the county-level concept is the most precise."
287909000,Thumb reconstructed (situation),Follow-up note: thumb reconstructed,"This follow-up documentation states the thumb is reconstructed, capturing the patient’s status. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It does not introduce attributes such as laterality, method, or cause, and it does not imply a planned or current procedure. As such, it most precisely maps to 'Thumb reconstructed (situation)' and not to procedure or sibling concepts. The context 'follow-up note' frames the entry but does not change the semantic content."
703944006,Referral for decongestive lymphatic therapy (procedure),Documentation: decongestive lymphatic therapy referral,"This entry documents a referral specifically for decongestive lymphatic therapy. The main concept is a referral Procedure, with no added details such as timing or reason. The exact SNOMED CT match is 'Referral for decongestive lymphatic therapy' (703944006). Coding the therapy itself would be incorrect, and using generic referral codes would lose the therapy specificity. Sibling concepts for other lymphatic modalities are not appropriate because the target—DLT—is clearly identified."
728987000,Entire lumen of membranous urethra (body structure),Whole internal bore of the membranous urethra,"“Internal bore” functions as a synonym for lumen, and “whole” indicates the entire lumen within the membranous segment. Category: Body structure. This excludes parent structures encompassing walls and surrounding tissues and avoids sibling lumens of other segments. No added attributes (e.g., pathology, laterality) are present, keeping it strictly anatomical."
729784009,Entire ulnar collateral ligament of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger (body structure),Exam focus: whole ulnar collateral ligament at finger PIP,"The entry indicates the examination focus is the whole UCL at the finger PIP joint, describing an anatomical structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. “Whole” conveys the ‘entire’ qualifier, directing selection to SCTID 729784009 rather than a non-entire ligament concept. Other collateral ligaments or different finger joints would be incorrect. No condition, side, or digit-specific details are introduced, keeping the mapping precise."
421148003,Substance with acetylcholine receptor agonist mechanism of action (substance),ACh receptor agonist,"This text uses the common abbreviation 'ACh' for acetylcholine and clearly specifies an agonist at the acetylcholine receptor. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The term aligns exactly with 421148003 by mechanism-of-action without adding receptor subtype or other attributes. Parent classes like 'receptor agonist' are overly broad, while children like 'muscarinic receptor agonist' or 'nicotinic receptor agonist' would narrow the meaning beyond what is stated. The abbreviation does not change the code selection."
736390003,Gynecology major surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient PoC — major gynecology surgery,"This entry uses “PoC” (plan of care) as a synonym for care plan and specifies an inpatient plan for major gynecology surgery. Attributes include artifact type (care plan/PoC), specialty (gynecology), magnitude (major surgery), and setting (inpatient). The category is Record artifact. The abbreviation PoC is a clinically accepted synonym and does not change the concept. Parents are too broad, and siblings such as outpatient or minor surgery care plans, or different artifact types like clinical pathways or order sets, would not be correct. SCTID 736390003 is the proper match."
247691006,Delusion of replacement of will by external force (finding),Experiences will being overridden and replaced by an external force,"This entry emphasizes that the will is overridden and replaced by an external force, which fits SNOMED CT 247691006 (Clinical finding). ‘Overridden’ here does not add a separate attribute; it reinforces the replacement of volition. The focus on will ensures this does not map to thought control or made actions, maintaining precise alignment with the concept."
735216000,Chronic total occlusion catheter (physical object),Disposed of one chronic total occlusion catheter after use,"This post-use documentation still refers to the Physical object, the chronic total occlusion catheter, aligning with SNOMED CT 735216000. Disposal context does not add attributes or imply a different device subtype (e.g., balloon or microcatheter), keeping it precise. A parent catheter concept would be too general. The wording is a direct synonym and correctly maps to the CTO catheter."
414040007,Divided highway (environment),Road type recorded: divided highway,"This entry records the road type as a divided highway, identifying the environmental context by its defining separation feature. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 414040007 is the precise code, as it targets the divided highway environment. Parents (e.g., generic road) are insufficiently specific, and siblings (e.g., undivided highway) would misrepresent the setting. No extra attributes are present."
69297003,Pool (environment),Patient statement: at the pool,"This is a patient-reported phrasing placing the person at a 'pool,' conveying only the environmental context. It best fits the Environment or geographical location hierarchy, specifically Pool (environment) SCTID 69297003. Broader water-related environments are less precise, and more specific variants (swimming pool, hot tub) are not stated. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to specifying the pool environment and does not alter attributes or code selection."
216964005,Inappropriate temperature of locally applied material (event),Local cryotherapy material applied at unsuitable temperature,"This describes a cryotherapy material used locally being applied at an unsuitable temperature, aligning with inappropriate temperature without adding effects or sites. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 216964005 is the best fit because it covers temperature issues with locally applied materials. Using a parent Event would be too general, and children implying injury are not relevant. 'Unsuitable temperature' is clinically equivalent and does not alter the concept."
1290688002,Genus Anaerobutyricum (organism),Catalog entry: Anaerobutyricum (genus),"This catalog-style notation lists Anaerobutyricum with the genus rank, making the taxon unambiguous. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism category and corresponds precisely to Genus Anaerobutyricum (1290688002). The wording does not introduce species, strain, or clinical context, so child or finding concepts are not appropriate. Parent categories would be less specific, and the bracketed ‘genus’ clarifies the taxonomic level without changing the intended concept."
304173007,Thoracic spinal approach (qualifier value),Access route: thoracic spinal,"This formulation uses 'access route' as a synonym for approach and specifies 'thoracic spinal', mapping to Thoracic spinal approach (304173007) as a Qualifier value. No extra qualifiers (e.g., percutaneous vs open, orientation, level) are included. Generic or non-spinal thoracic routes would be less accurate, and orientation-specific thoracic spinal approaches would be more detailed than stated. The synonym maintains equivalence and precision."
713042000,Ecomap (record artifact),Eco-map,"This entry uses a hyphenated spelling variant of the same artifact, 'Eco-map', which is a recognized synonym for ecomap in clinical and social work documentation. The main concept is the artifact itself, fitting the Record artifact category. Ecomap (record artifact) [713042000] is the exact code since it denotes this specific diagram type. Parent concepts like 'Record artifact' are insufficiently specific, and sibling artifacts such as 'Genogram' would misrepresent the type of diagram. The hyphenation does not add any attributes or change the meaning, so the code selection remains unchanged."
119385003,Specimen from left fallopian tube (specimen),Collected specimen—left fallopian tube,"This concise entry indicates a collected specimen originating from the left fallopian tube, without mentioning type, method, or related conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It precisely corresponds to “Specimen from left fallopian tube.” Using a parent concept would omit laterality, while children requiring explicit material (tissue, fluid) or method would not fit the wording. The dash is stylistic and does not add attributes."
736248007,Pain control care plan (record artifact),Pain control care plan referenced in clinic note,"The entry notes a reference to a pain control care plan within a clinic note, emphasizing the existence of the plan artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This aligns with 'Pain control care plan (record artifact)'. A general care plan would be under-specified, and pain findings/procedures would be misclassified. The referencing context does not alter attributes."
399559008,Specimen from uvea obtained by enucleation of eye (specimen),Specimen from uvea following eye enucleation,"This entry states that the specimen is from the uvea and was obtained following enucleation of the eye, with no other attributes included. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Specimen from uvea obtained by enucleation of eye (399559008) is the exact match because it captures both the anatomical source and procurement method. Parent concepts omitting method and sibling concepts for entire eye specimens or specific uveal parts are less precise. The phrasing is a clear paraphrase retaining the same meaning."
1380076002,Union for International Cancer Control aT1b2 (qualifier value),aT1b2 per UICC TNM,"The phrase states the autopsy TNM T category aT1b2 under UICC. This maps to the Qualifier value UICC aT1b2 and is not a disorder or finding. The explicit 'a' prefix and the T1b2 subdivision ensure this is not a generic T1b2 or a different prefix like c/p/y/r. As a synonym, it is clinically equivalent and does not add any extra context beyond the exact qualifier value."
245999007,Entire thoracic rotator muscle (body structure),Spine anatomy focus: thoracic rotator muscle,"This entry sets the focus within spine anatomy and names the thoracic rotator muscle, i.e., rotatores thoracis. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to 'Entire thoracic rotator muscle (body structure)' [245999007], specifying the whole thoracic rotator muscle entity without subtype or pathology. Parent concepts like 'Spinal muscle' are too broad, and child/sibling concepts (cervical/lumbar rotatores or longus/brevis) would not match the thoracic scope. The contextual phrase 'anatomy focus' does not introduce new attributes."
703853000,Narrative comment section of pathology report (record artifact),Narrative comment section labeled ‘Comments’ in pathology report,"This entry points to the pathology report subsection labeled 'Comments', indicating the narrative comment section. Attributes are the document type (pathology report), the section label ('Comments'), and narrative nature. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 703853000 is exact because it codes the narrative comment section of a pathology report. Using a parent concept for comments in any report would be overly broad, and selecting sibling sections (e.g., diagnostic conclusion) would be incorrect. Referencing the typical label 'Comments' is a synonym for the narrative comments section and does not add attributes such as content, timing, or status, preserving precise mapping."
309937004,Neurology department (environment),Neurological department,"Using the adjective 'neurological' still identifies the same departmental environment where neurology services are provided. The main concept remains a department location. Category: Environment or geographical location. Neurology department (environment) [309937004] is the most specific fit. The wording does not imply a ward, unit, or clinic and avoids timing, laterality, or population qualifiers. Thus, broader parents are too vague, and siblings like Neurosurgery department or Neurophysiology lab are incorrect."
223543009,South west African country (geographic location),Geographic location: south west African country,"The entry uses a label plus value format, where the value is a country in southwestern Africa. The substantive concept remains the location value, which is a Geographic location (environment) and matches SCTID 223543009. Parent concepts are broader, and specific-country children are not supported. The contextual label 'Geographic location:' does not alter the coded concept, as it simply frames the value without adding attributes like time or causation."
9617008,"Hyperlipoproteinemia diet, type I (finding)",Diet tailored for type I hyperlipoproteinemia,"This wording signals a diet specifically tailored to Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, which matches the named diet finding SCTID 9617008. “Tailored” describes specificity without adding content attributes (e.g., macronutrient targets). It is more exact than a general hyperlipoproteinemia diet and not applicable to sibling diets for other types, nor to the disorder code."
103402003,Unsaturated (qualifier value),Unsaturated (value),"Adding '(value)' clarifies usage as a qualifier value, not a disorder or substance, while preserving the concept of 'Unsaturated.' The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and Unsaturated (qualifier value) [103402003] is the precise selection. Parent categories are too general, and siblings like 'Saturated' are inconsistent with the entry; no extra attributes are introduced."
42625000,Strongyloides stercoralis (organism),Strongyloides stercoralis species,"The wording indicates a species designation and provides the exact species name Strongyloides stercoralis, which belongs to the Organism hierarchy. This maps most precisely to SCTID 42625000. It does not imply a clinical finding, infection, or broader genus-level identification; thus parent or sibling organism concepts are less accurate than the specific species concept."
73917004,Hallucinosis (finding),Assessment: hallucinosis,"This entry states hallucinosis as the assessed finding, maintaining neutrality without adding modality, etiology, or temporal qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, and the best match is Hallucinosis (finding) 73917004. More general sibling concepts like Hallucination (finding) do not capture the syndrome-level nature of hallucinosis, and etiologic children are excluded due to absent cause information. The entry does not imply a disorder diagnosis or a different mental state."
258059001,Pharmacological stimulation (qualifier value),Drug-mediated stimulation,"The main concept is stimulation mediated by drugs, which is clinically equivalent to pharmacological stimulation. This fits the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category, serving as an attribute that specifies the method of stimulation. It is more precise than a generic parent like 'Stimulation' because it states the method (drug-mediated) and does not drift into sibling methods (e.g., electrical). It avoids agent naming, target organ, timing, or purpose (e.g., stress testing), so no child or procedure concept is better. 'Drug-mediated' is a standard paraphrase for pharmacologic and preserves the modality without adding attributes."
4351000179105,Radioisotope laboratory report (record artifact),Follow-up: radioisotope laboratory report,"This entry references the presence of a radioisotope laboratory report in a follow-up context, but it still denotes the report artifact and not any results or procedure details. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Record artifact category and maps to “Radioisotope laboratory report (record artifact)” SCTID 4351000179105. Parent concepts are overly broad, and imaging report siblings are unsuitable because this explicitly concerns lab reporting. The follow-up context does not add attributes that change the artifact’s identity; it remains the same codable concept."
122596005,"Specimen from breast obtained by complete excision of lesion, less than total mastectomy (specimen)",Received in pathology: breast specimen from complete excision of lesion; mastectomy not done,"The entry documents a pathology receipt of a breast specimen resulting from complete excision of a lesion, with explicit notation that mastectomy was not performed. The main concept is a breast specimen defined by complete lesion excision and breast-conserving approach. Category: Specimen. It matches SCTID 122596005, avoiding mapping to a generic parent specimen and excluding mastectomy or partial excision siblings. The language is a direct synonym and does not introduce any new attributes."
350072003,Product containing F series prostaglandin (product),Prostaglandin F series–containing product,"This entry states that the product contains a prostaglandin belonging to the F series, which conveys the same ingredient class as PGF. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It aligns precisely with the class-level concept “Product containing F series prostaglandin” and avoids any specification of PGF2α, analogs, dose form, or indication. A parent concept like “Product containing prostaglandin” is too general because it does not restrict to the F series. Child concepts for specific PGF agents or analogs would be too narrow and therefore less appropriate. The paraphrase is a clinically equivalent synonym that maintains the same meaning without introducing new attributes."
370537009,Yin excess (finding),Yin excess state,"“State” here denotes the condition of Yin being excessive without introducing severity or cause, aligning with the TCM finding. The category is Clinical finding. The precise match is SCTID 370537009. Parent categories are too general, while sibling concepts (Yin deficiency or Yang excess) contradict the specified excess of Yin."
242301003,Accidental ingestion of ergot (event),Accidental consumption of ergot,"The term 'consumption' is clinically equivalent to ingestion in this context and maintains the accidental nature and the specific substance ergot. As such, it maps directly to the Event concept 242301003. It avoids implications of poisoning or therapy and is more precise than generic accidental consumption of an unspecified substance, while not adding attributes that would necessitate a child or sibling concept."
16210691000119101,Breast cyst specimen (specimen),Accession includes a breast cyst specimen,"This entry indicates that among the submitted materials, there is a specimen sourced from a breast cyst. The primary concept is a specimen; no additional attributes are conveyed. Category: Specimen. It best fits Breast cyst specimen, avoiding both under-specification (parents) and over-specification (children specifying aspirate, fluid, or side)."
768607004,Product containing benzazepine (product),Catalog item: product containing benzazepine,"While referencing a catalog context, the semantic content is a product that contains benzazepine. This is within the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category. SCTID 768607004 fits because the ingredient containment is stated with no additional qualifiers. Parent concepts are too general, and child concepts requiring specified presentation or single-ingredient status are not supported. Substance-only concepts are inappropriate as the entry is about a product entity."
405776004,Planned admission (situation),Awaiting planned admission,"This indicates the patient is awaiting an admission that has been planned, emphasizing the plan status. The concept is a Situation. It maps to SNOMED CT 405776004 because it denotes a planned admission without specifying reason, location, or urgency. Procedural admission codes imply the event has occurred; more specific siblings (e.g., emergency admission) would add qualifiers not expressed in this entry."
445295009,Blood specimen with edetic acid (specimen),Specimen: Blood — EDTA,"This lab-style entry specifies the specimen type (blood) and the anticoagulant (EDTA), which maps directly to 'Blood specimen with edetic acid (specimen)' SCTID 445295009. The category is Specimen. It is more specific than the parent 'Blood specimen' by naming EDTA, and it avoids child concepts by not stating EDTA subtype or collection route. It does not imply a sibling like heparin or citrate. 'EDTA' is a clinically accepted synonym for edetic acid, so the code selection is appropriate."
183171004,Hip disarticulation prosthesis (physical object),Hip disarticulation level prosthesis,"This is a prosthesis at the hip disarticulation level, directly aligning with the intended device concept. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). The term is semantically equivalent to the preferred name and does not introduce attributes such as side or construction. It is more specific than generic limb prostheses and distinct from internal hip prostheses."
257983009,Lower case Roman letter b (qualifier value),"literal 'b', lower-case Roman","The entry uses “literal” to emphasize the character itself and explicitly states lower-case Roman, matching the qualifier value for lower case Roman letter b. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It excludes uppercase B and Greek beta, and is more specific than general letter categories. The synonym “literal” does not add new attributes; it maintains equivalence."
251267008,Atrio-ventricular sequential pacing pattern (finding),A–V sequential paced pattern,"Using 'A–V' as shorthand for atrial-to-ventricular and 'paced pattern' communicates the same clinical finding: sequential atrial pacing followed by ventricular pacing. This falls under the Clinical finding hierarchy. It is not better mapped to parent or sibling concepts because it distinctly denotes both chambers pacing sequentially rather than one chamber alone. No mode (e.g., DDD) or device details are introduced, ensuring a clean match to 'Atrio-ventricular sequential pacing pattern' (251267008)."
88514006,Rhizoprionodon longurio (organism),Pacific sharpnose shark,"The phrase is the accepted common name for the species Rhizoprionodon longurio. It denotes the organism without adding attributes like exposure, injury, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 88514006 precisely represents this species. A parent such as a generic shark or the Rhizoprionodon genus would be too broad, and sibling species (e.g., Atlantic sharpnose shark, R. terraenovae) would be incorrect. The common name is a clinically safe synonym that is equivalent to the scientific name."
346403001,Disaccharide and protein intolerance food (product),Prior authorization for disaccharide and protein intolerance food,This documents approval for a food product designed for concurrent disaccharide and protein intolerance. SNOMED CT category: Product—Food (product). Administrative phrasing does not change the product identity. Coding a general food product or a single-intolerance product would not match the explicit dual indication. SCTID 346403001 provides the precise representation required.
371905006,Medication administered during lab visit (situation),Medication given during lab appointment,"The text states medication was given, and the encounter context was a lab appointment, which is synonymous with lab visit. This belongs to the Situation with explicit context category and maps directly to SCTID 371905006. More general concepts without the lab context or siblings referencing different visit types would be less accurate. 'Given' and 'appointment' are standard synonyms that do not add attributes or change the intended code."
223389001,Lesser Antilles island (geographic location),Location specified as Lesser Antilles island,"This statement declares the location and uses the precise term 'Lesser Antilles island,' corresponding to SNOMED CT SCTID 223389001 (Geographic location). The phrase is contextual but does not add other semantic attributes. It is more specific than 'Island' and more general than naming a particular island, keeping it at the correct level of granularity. It excludes sibling regions such as the Greater Antilles by naming Lesser Antilles explicitly."
427651091000119106,Chikungunya virus vaccination given (situation),Chikungunya immunization given,"‘Immunization given’ is a clinically standard synonym for vaccine administration and clearly communicates that the chikungunya immunization event occurred. The concept category is Situation with explicit context, and the best-matched code is “Chikungunya virus vaccination given (situation)” SCTID 427651091000119106. No additional attributes (dose, time, route) are present, so child or sibling concepts are not a better fit. This phrasing does not imply planning or refusal."
43961000119109,Pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccination given (situation),Administered: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7-valent).,"Main concept: documentation that the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was administered. Attributes: vaccine type (pneumococcal conjugate) and valency (7-valent), with explicit context of administration completed. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 43961000119109 is the exact match because it captures vaccination given for PCV7. Parent concepts lack the valency specificity, and sibling concepts represent different formulations (e.g., PCV13). The term 'administered' is equivalent to 'given/received' and signifies a completed event, appropriately coded as a situation rather than a procedure record."
360028004,Surgical biopsy - action (qualifier value),Surgical biopsy (action qualifier),"By labeling “surgical biopsy” as an action qualifier, the entry directly references the SNOMED CT Qualifier value for actions. The concept is purely the action term, without introducing attributes such as location, approach subtype, or temporal status. The correct code is Surgical biopsy - action (360028004). More general parent actions like Biopsy - action fail to reflect the surgical nature, and specific siblings (incisional/excisional) are not implied. This phrasing avoids mapping to a procedure, preserving the qualifier value intent."
223974002,Powys (geographic location),"Powys, UK","The core concept is the geographic location Powys, with ""UK"" indicating national context. Category: Geographic location (Location). The appropriate code is Powys (geographic location) SCTID 223974002, because the entry identifies the specific county. Mentioning ""UK"" does not change the concept or introduce a separate attribute; it merely situates the county within the country. Parent concepts like United Kingdom or Wales would be broader, and other counties are siblings and therefore not as specific as Powys."
1306652002,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with full smile and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),"Dental record image—extraoral left half of face, full smile, centric relation","The phrase identifies a photographic record artifact: extraoral image, confined to the left half of the face, depicting a full smile with jaws in centric relation. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It matches the designated concept because it includes all specified attributes and does not introduce factors like occlusion type other than centric relation, timing, or additional views. Parent concepts lacking smile or laterality are too general, and child/sibling variations (e.g., different jaw positions or right-sided images) do not apply."
224692000,Sitting room (environment),Sitting room area,"This phrasing references the 'sitting room' as an area, but it still denotes the same environmental room and does not create a distinct sub-concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and 'Sitting room (environment)' SCTID 224692000 is the most accurate code. Parent concepts like general 'room' or 'indoor area' would be less exact, and sibling rooms are not implied. The term 'area' is a generic descriptor and does not change the coded concept."
1222823007,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III:12 (qualifier value),AJCC stage group: III,"By stating “stage group” and the value III under AJCC, this entry is an exact representation of the AJCC stage III value. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value; SCTID 1222823007 is the most precise mapping. It does not add attributes like clinical/pathologic designation, edition, or tumor site, thereby avoiding child or related concepts. Sibling stage groups (I, II, IV) are not implied. The term “stage group” is a clinically equivalent expression used in AJCC nomenclature."
404438004,"Salmonella IIIa 42:g,z51:- (organism)","Salmonella IIIa (42:g,z51:-) taxonomic designation","This specifies the taxonomic designation of the organism Salmonella IIIa with antigenic formula 42:g,z51:-. The main concept is Organism. It maps directly to SCTID 404438004. More general Salmonella groupings or different antigenic designations would not represent the same organism with the exact specificity captured here."
710549002,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Western equine encephalitis virus (substance),"Western equine encephalitis virus antibody, IgG class","This phrasing identifies the antibody to Western equine encephalitis virus and clarifies the class as IgG, defining the substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 710549002 captures this exact entity. Parent concepts that lack class specification or target are too general, and sibling concepts that change the class (e.g., IgM) or target would not match. The synonym is clinically equivalent and adds no attributes like result or timing."
48164007,Structure of mental nerve (body structure),Operative note mentions the mental nerve,"The operative note mention points to the mental nerve structure, with no additional attributes such as injury, repair, or side, keeping the focus on anatomy. It fits the Body structure category. SCTID 48164007 corresponds precisely to the mental nerve. Parent concepts and sibling nerves are not appropriate because the text names this specific nerve, and child laterality concepts are not implied."
130135000,Dimethylglycine oxidase (substance),Dimethylglycine-oxidase,"This is a hyphenated orthographic variant of the same enzyme name, expressing only the substance without additional properties or context. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It codes to SCTID 130135000, the specific enzyme dimethylglycine oxidase. Parent terms are too general (e.g., oxidase enzymes), and children or siblings would introduce different substrates or modifications, none of which are implied. The hyphen does not alter meaning or coding."
737014005,History of previous baby breast fed (situation),Patient has breastfed a previous infant,"The entry conveys that the patient performed breastfeeding in the past on a previous infant, clearly a historical situation. Category: Situation. This targets the precise concept of 'History of previous baby breast fed' rather than broader formulations like 'history of breastfeeding' or active states such as 'currently breastfeeding.' Using 'previous infant' instead of 'previous baby' is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not alter code selection."
217142006,Fall from chair or bed (event),Mechanism: fall from chair or bed,"This entry identifies the mechanism of the event as a fall from a chair or bed, which is exactly the scope of Fall from chair or bed (event), SCTID 217142006. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Stating it as a mechanism keeps the concept focused and does not introduce injury details or timing. It is more specific than the parent Fall (event) and appropriately includes both chair and bed, avoiding child concepts restricted to one source."
213990001,Injured by object set in motion by train - pedal cyclist (event),Bike rider injured when struck by object set in motion by train,"Main concepts: a bike rider (pedal cyclist) was injured when struck by an object set in motion by a train. SNOMED CT category: Event. “Bike rider” is a standard synonym for pedal cyclist, and the mechanism is captured accurately. This aligns exactly with SCTID 213990001. Parent concepts are broader without specifying the cyclist, and siblings involving direct train collision or non-train movers are not supported by the entry."
472920001,Umbilical catheter submitted as specimen (specimen),Umbilical catheter specimen received,"The text states that the specimen received is an umbilical catheter, matching the SNOMED CT Specimen concept (472920001). Category: Specimen. The entry does not add clinical attributes such as location, device type subdivision, or testing purpose. It is more precise than broader parents (e.g., 'Catheter specimen') and does not imply a child concept such as a venous or arterial subtype or a catheter tip, maintaining exact correspondence."
258030001,Gradient method (qualifier value),Technique: Gradient method,"The wording frames the concept as a technique and names it specifically as “Gradient method,” which is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the qualifier. The main concept is the methodological technique, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This aligns exactly with Gradient method (258030001) and does not suggest any more specific gradient subtype or alternative method (siblings like chromatographic or immunologic methods), making parent or child concepts less appropriate."
65227004,Blood group antigen Gilbraith (substance),Patient-facing term: Gilbraith blood group antigen,"Even in a patient-facing context, the term names the antigen entity Gilbraith, a blood group antigen. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance with SCTID 65227004. No attributes of clinical status, testing, or immune response are implied. Using a patient-facing label does not change the underlying concept. More general parent concepts lack the specific name, and sibling antigen names do not match."
367970005,Structure of costal groove of third rib (body structure),Third rib: costal groove,"This entry states the rib level followed by the specific structure, indicating the costal groove of the third rib without adding any attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and SCTID 367970005 exactly matches. Parent concepts that do not include the rib number or siblings that reference other ribs would be less accurate. The colon is a documentation style choice and does not affect the concept."
224905006,Second floor (environment),Level two of the building,"The entry describes the second floor by specifying level two in a building. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224905006 is the most precise selection; choosing a parent concept that covers any level would be overly generic, and a sibling level would not match the number two. The phrasing is a semantic equivalent without added qualifiers."
736357003,Minor gynecology surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient minor gynecology surgical care plan,"This phrase identifies a care plan document in the inpatient environment targeted at minor gynecology surgical care. The attributes are inpatient status and minor gynecology surgery, with the artifact being a care plan. The best SNOMED CT match is the Record artifact Minor gynecology surgery inpatient care plan (SCTID: 736357003). It excludes broader or different settings (e.g., outpatient) and different scopes (e.g., major surgery or non-gynecologic). The adjective 'surgical' is a clinically equivalent way to denote 'surgery' and does not change code selection."
697161010000103,Immunoglobulin E antibody to Aspergillus nidulans (substance),Aspergillus nidulans immunoglobulin E,"The phrase refers to an immunoglobulin E that is associated with Aspergillus nidulans specificity, implying an IgE antibody targeting that species. It does not add clinical result or procedural attributes, so it represents a Substance. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is Immunoglobulin E antibody to Aspergillus nidulans (substance). A parent like general IgE or IgE to Aspergillus genus lacks species precision, and siblings (e.g., IgE to A. fumigatus) misidentify the target. The wording is a shortened synonym that retains the same meaning."
59938004,Thallium-208 (substance),Prior notes reference Thallium-208,"Referencing Thallium-208 in prior notes keeps the focus on the named substance without adding role or context details that would change the code. The main concept is Thallium-208. SNOMED CT category is Substance; SCTID 59938004 is the exact match. The mention does not imply a finding or procedure. The parent thallium code is too broad, and sibling isotope codes would be incorrect, so this specific isotope substance code is appropriate."
1141702004,No aggressive behavior (situation),Negative for aggressive behavior.,"This phrasing indicates a negative finding regarding aggressive behavior, which represents absence. It is a Situation concept documenting contextual non-occurrence. It maps directly to “No aggressive behavior (situation)” by explicitly stating the negative status and avoiding additional attributes. A parent concept like general negative findings would be too broad, and siblings involving presence of aggression or other behaviors would not fit. The “negative for” construction is clinically equivalent to “no” in this context."
294847001,Allergy to gelatin (finding),Vaccination screening: gelatin allergy present.,"This screening note indicates the presence of a gelatin allergy in the immunization context but does not imply an allergy to vaccines themselves—only to the substance gelatin. Category: Clinical finding. The precise code is SNOMED CT Allergy to gelatin (SCTID 294847001). More generic allergy codes or vaccine-allergy concepts would be less appropriate, and no source subtype of gelatin is specified."
1187647002,Island in region of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (geographic location),Island of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands region,"The entry denotes an island belonging to or within the SGSSI region; no additional qualifiers are present. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). It correctly maps to SCTID 1187647002 since it identifies an island in that region, whereas parent concepts (generic islands or geographic locations) are too broad and child concepts (specific SGSSI islands) are narrower. The phrasing “of the … region” is a synonymous way to express containment."
39378008,Hydrastinine (substance),Hydrastinine—recorded as substance,"The phrase documents Hydrastinine as a substance, aligning with SNOMED CT’s Substance category. It does not add attributes related to clinical use, detection, dosage, or salt form, avoiding misclassification as a product or finding. Parent concepts are too broad, and children (specific formulations) are not indicated, making 'Hydrastinine (substance)' the most precise selection."
648131000005102,Presence of erythrocytes in urine (observable entity),Documented presence of RBCs in urine,"The entry records that the presence of RBCs in urine has been documented, a qualitative presence observation. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It includes no quantification or diagnostic interpretation, so SCTID 648131000005102 is the precise code. It is not better captured by hematuria (clinical finding) or by observables related to RBC count or morphology. 'RBCs' is a standard synonym for erythrocytes, keeping the concept intact."
311958003,Blacking (substance),Substance: blacking,"The entry frames Blacking as the named substance, with the colon serving only to indicate a label and not additional meaning. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Blacking (substance) SCTID: 311958003 is the exact match because the content identifies the material itself. Broader or sibling concepts are not warranted; the entry does not reference lamp black, carbon black, polish products, or any use/exposure scenario. No extraneous attributes are present."
66133008,Triatoma infestans (organism),T. infestans,"This entry uses the standard scientific abbreviation for Triatoma infestans, which remains a species-level Organism concept. Despite the abbreviated genus, it is clinically equivalent to the full binomial and uniquely identifies SCTID 66133008 without implying any broader taxonomic group or additional attributes. Mapping to the parent genus Triatoma would be less specific, and no child concepts (such as life stage variants) are indicated by this wording."
111942003,Legal execution by lethal injection (event),Legal capital execution by lethal injection,This phrase combines legal status (“legal capital execution”) with the precise method (“lethal injection”). It is an Event and aligns with SNOMED CT 111942003. Coding only to “Legal execution” would not include the method; using other method variants would miscode. The wording is a clear synonym set and does not add extraneous attributes.
702965006,Population of all monocytes in portion of fluid (body structure),Target structure: monocyte population in portion of fluid,"This documentation-style entry identifies the anatomical target as the monocyte population in a fluid portion, with no added attributes like site specificity or measurement. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 702965006 precisely represents the population of all monocytes in a fluid portion. Parent concepts are too general and siblings specify other leukocytes or fluid locations not stated. The term remains anatomical, not observable or specimen-related, ensuring accurate mapping to the body structure hierarchy."
244885004,Entire seventh external intercostal muscle (body structure),Specified structure: entire seventh external intercostal muscle,"The entry explicitly calls out the whole seventh external intercostal muscle, making it a precise anatomical Body structure reference. It matches SCTID 244885004 by combining the external intercostal type with the seventh designation and the qualifier ""entire"" indicating the full muscle. Parent concepts lack ordinal detail, and sibling concepts represent different numbered muscles. The contextual label does not introduce new attributes."
710942001,Insect protein (substance),Formulation component: insect protein,"This entry presents insect protein as a component of a formulation, maintaining focus on the substance rather than a finished product. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 710942001 is the most appropriate code. Parent concepts like Protein (substance) lack the specified origin, and allergen or exposure/event concepts are not indicated by the wording."
723839006,Structure of epiphysis of left femoral head (body structure),Surgical landmark: left femoral head epiphysis,"The phrase frames the left femoral head epiphysis as a surgical landmark, but the anatomical target remains the epiphysis of the left femoral head. The main concept is a Body structure with left laterality. Broader parents or siblings like right-sided epiphysis, femoral neck, or acetabular landmarks are not implied. The contextual label 'surgical landmark' does not add clinical attributes and is semantically equivalent in identifying the same structure."
57711000052109,Specimen obtained by puncture procedure (specimen),Collected specimen via puncture,"This entry denotes a specimen and states it was collected via puncture, with no mention of site, type, or timing. The category is Specimen. It is appropriately coded to SCTID 57711000052109, as the essence is a specimen obtained through puncture. Parent 'Specimen' is too generic, and child/sibling concepts specifying venous, arterial, or capillary puncture are not conveyed. The phrasing is an acceptable synonym that maintains code fidelity."
183211003,Ileostomy bag fitting (procedure),Nursing note: ileostomy bag fitting performed,"This entry records that the nursing staff performed the fitting of an ileostomy bag, emphasizing the procedure without adding extraneous attributes. The concept is procedural and maps to the SNOMED CT category Procedure. SCTID 183211003 is the most precise code because it covers ileostomy bag fitting. Alternatives like ostomy education, care, or appliance change would be different activities; generic stoma fitting would lack the ileostomy specificity stated here."
1187300001,Islands of Australia (geographic location),Island regions of Australia,"The wording refers to the regional grouping of islands that belong to Australia and remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term. No additional qualifiers are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The exact match is SCTID 1187300001; broader Australia-wide concepts include mainland and would be imprecise, and single-island children are too narrow. Sibling concepts for non-Australian island regions would not match."
728815004,Entire gonadal vein (body structure),CT venogram: gonadal vein,"This report-style entry cites the gonadal vein in the context of CT venography without adding attributes like laterality, sex, or abnormality. Main concept: gonadal vein anatomy. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. Entire gonadal vein (SCTID 728815004) is the most precise because the structure is referenced generically and completely. A parent like 'venous structure' is too vague, while children such as 'ovarian vein' or 'testicular vein' require sex specificity not present here. The imaging context does not change the anatomical code."
11018001,Structure of greater splanchnic nerve (body structure),Radiologic anatomy: greater splanchnic nerve,"The entry places the greater splanchnic nerve in a radiologic anatomy context but still denotes only the structure itself. It is a Body structure in SNOMED CT. SCTID 11018001 is the most specific match, naming the greater splanchnic nerve. More general parents or alternate splanchnic nerves would not be accurate. The radiologic context does not introduce new attributes or alter the concept."
396998007,Specimen from bone marrow obtained by aspiration and biopsy (specimen),Bone marrow aspirate & biopsy sample,"The term “sample” is a common clinical synonym for specimen; combined with “bone marrow aspirate & biopsy,” it denotes a specimen that includes both modalities. This aligns with the Specimen category in SNOMED CT. Code 396998007 is apt because it specifies aspiration and biopsy origin. Parent concepts like generic marrow specimens are too non-specific, while child/sibling concepts restricted to one method are insufficient. Using “sample” does not shift the meaning from specimen or introduce additional attributes."
36531000087106,Photorhabdus noenieputensis (organism),Isolate labeled as Photorhabdus noenieputensis,"The phrase denotes that an isolate has been labeled taxonomically as Photorhabdus noenieputensis, identifying only the organism without site or clinical context. The concept type is Organism. The exact SNOMED CT code is the species concept (36531000087106). Parent genus-level or sibling species concepts are inappropriate because the species is explicitly named, and no strain or pathologic attributes are provided to warrant a different concept."
371530004,Clinical consultation report (record artifact),Clinical consultation documentation,"This phrase denotes the documented artifact resulting from a clinical consultation. While phrased as “documentation,” it still refers specifically to the consultation report. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and Clinical consultation report (371530004) is the exact fit. It is not a generic clinical document (parent) because the consultation qualifier is explicit, and it avoids siblings such as Referral letter, Discharge summary, or Imaging report, which would imply different types of content."
1351894008,Mixed field RhD (finding),Mixed-field phenotype for RhD,"This entry indicates a phenotype displaying mixed-field characteristics for RhD, signifying mixed field RhD. It is a Clinical finding. The wording fits SCTID 1351894008 since it specifies RhD and mixed-field, distinguishing it from other RhD phenotypes such as weak or partial D. Parent-level blood group phenotype or RhD phenotype codes are less precise. Use of “phenotype” here is a common clinical shorthand for the serologic finding and does not add attributes."
405081003,Leisure behavior (observable entity),Leisure behavior reviewed during follow-up,"The entry focuses on leisure behavior, with follow-up being a documentation timing context rather than a property of the observable. It belongs to the Observable entity category, and SCTID 405081003 is the precise concept. No attributes such as qualitative descriptors or outcomes are added, preventing drift to more specific behavior-related observables. A generic behavior observable would omit leisure specificity. The phrase is consistent with the target concept and does not necessitate a different code."
214517781000087109,Myxotrichum deflexum (organism),Taxon recorded: Myxotrichum deflexum,"The phrase records the taxon Myxotrichum deflexum without assigning clinical attributes or test outcomes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It is purely taxonomic, so the species-level organism concept is most appropriate; parent genus or clinical finding codes would be less precise or add meaning not present."
373849002,Fixed field external beam radiation therapy parameters (observable entity),Non-rotational external beam radiation therapy parameters,"This entry describes the parameter set for external beam therapy delivered without rotational arcs, i.e., fixed fields, making the parameters the observable entity. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 373849002 is most accurate because ""non-rotational"" corresponds to fixed-field delivery; selecting a general EBRT parameter concept would be less precise, and arc-based parameter concepts would be inappropriate given the explicit non-rotational qualifier. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to fixed-field and maintains the same coding."
297927000,Enets language (qualifier value),Enets (language),"This entry names “Enets” and clarifies it as a language, which directly corresponds to Enets language (SCTID: 297927000) under Qualifier value. By specifying “(language),” it avoids ambiguity with any ethnic or non-language concepts and does not add attributes such as preference or fluency. Parent Language concepts are too general, and other specific language siblings would be incorrect. The synonymic phrasing is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
223936005,Grampian (geographic location),Reference place — Grampian,"“Reference place” identifies Grampian as a geographic place, which is directly codable to Grampian (geographic location), SCTID 223936005. Category: Location—Geographic location. The hyphenated label is contextual and does not introduce additional attributes. It clearly excludes organizations or physiographic features, and no broader or narrower places are mentioned, making this the precise concept match."
223807006,Mayo (geographic location),Visit took place in Mayo,"The entry uses 'in Mayo' to denote a place where the visit occurred, pointing to the geographic location. Category: Geographic location (Location). It matches SCTID 223807006 and avoids misinterpretation as an organization; no child specificity (county/town) is introduced, so the general 'Mayo' geographic concept is appropriate."
48901000119103,History of invasive malignant neoplasm of breast (situation),Medical record indicates history of invasive breast cancer,"The medical record statement denotes a past invasive breast cancer, equivalent to invasive malignant neoplasm of breast, placed in a Situation with explicit context. It is more precise than ‘history of breast cancer’ because invasiveness is specified. It avoids family history and in situ siblings and does not introduce child attributes such as laterality or stage, maintaining specificity to the target SCTID."
729763004,Entire radial collateral ligament of metacarpophalangeal joint of index finger (body structure),Imaging protocol includes the entire radial collateral ligament of the index MCP,This describes an imaging focus on the entire radial collateral ligament of the index MCP joint. The concept is strictly a Body structure. SCTID 729763004 is the precise code because it refers to the complete radial collateral ligament at the specified joint. A parent lacking the completeness qualifier or siblings at other joints/digits are less appropriate. The wording avoids adding normal/abnormal status and remains anatomically focused.
350769003,Semi-permeable film dressing (physical object),Semi-permeable film dressing in place,"This indicates the presence of the specific dressing, not a procedure, focusing on the physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object; SCTID 350769003 is the most precise match because the entry specifies a semi-permeable film type. Coding to a generic Film dressing would lose the permeability detail, and coding to procedures (e.g., maintenance) would be inappropriate since the entry names the object."
346468008,House dust allergy vaccine (product),Immunization record: house dust allergy vaccine,"This immunization registry context identifies the product administered, the house dust allergy vaccine. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product, and the specific concept is House dust allergy vaccine (346468008). Mapping to an administration procedure code would be incorrect because the entry names the product. No extra attributes (e.g., route, dose, brand, mite) are present, ensuring precision over parents or siblings."
242484007,Accident caused directly by portable sources of ignition (event),Clinician assessment: accident directly caused by a portable ignition source.,"The statement asserts an accident with a direct cause being a portable ignition source; no injury details, device types, or other attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps to SCTID 242484007 by capturing the specificity of direct causality and portability. Parent concepts that lack either attribute would be less specific. Sibling concepts involving fixed ignition sources or indirect causes are ruled out by ‘portable’ and ‘directly.’ The absence of device subtype prevents mapping to child concepts like matches or lighters, keeping the code selection focused on the general portable source of ignition."
309965002,Occupational health department (environment),Occupational health department noted as setting,"By noting the occupational health department as the setting, the phrase clearly indicates the environmental context of a department devoted to occupational health. This fits the SNOMED CT Environment category and maps to 309965002. No additional attributes are implied, and it does not suggest a different organizational unit like a clinic or a service. Parents like generic hospital department are less specific, and siblings pertaining to services would not match the environmental emphasis. Therefore, 309965002 is the most accurate code."
1290011002,Intravenous rehydration therapy (procedure),Observation: intravenous rehydration therapy administered,"This observation documents administration of rehydration via the intravenous route, aligning precisely with Intravenous rehydration therapy (SCTID 1290011002) in the Procedure hierarchy. It avoids specifying fluid type, volume, or rate, and does not reference planning or history. The IV route and rehydration intent make parent or sibling concepts less accurate."
16909841000119103,Paralytic lagophthalmos of left upper and lower eyelids (finding),Telemedicine observation: paralytic lagophthalmos of both left lids (upper and lower),"The observation describes paralytic lagophthalmos and clearly references both left lids. Category: Clinical finding. It maps to SCTID 16909841000119103. A generic lagophthalmos or unspecified laterality is too broad, and variants involving only one lid or nonparalytic causes are excluded by the wording."
37052001,Tellurium hexafluoride (substance),Hexafluoride of tellurium,"This phrasing describes the same chemical entity as tellurium hexafluoride, specifying the hexafluoride derivative of tellurium without introducing any additional properties. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise target concept is Tellurium hexafluoride (substance). Generic tellurium fluoride or tellurium compound parents are too broad and siblings with different stoichiometry are incorrect. The synonym is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
468161008,Catheter-tip occluder (physical object),Catheter tip closure device,"“Closure device” in this context denotes an object that closes/occludes the catheter’s tip, aligning with a catheter-tip occluder. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 468161008 is the correct match as it specifies occlusion at the catheter tip. A parent such as general closure device lacks the catheter tip focus, and siblings like caps or clamps would imply different components or mechanisms. No attributes beyond the intended tip closure are present."
258815009,Micromole/deciliter (qualifier value),Value unit = μmol/dL,"This entry uses an assignment format to indicate the unit μmol/dL, which is micromole per deciliter. No measurement value or analyte is specified. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It maps directly to SCTID 258815009 as the specific unit; choosing a parent or sibling would be inaccurate given the explicit denominator in deciliters. The symbol form is a standard equivalent."
467430005,Conductive shoe (physical object),Replace with a conductive shoe,"The entry indicates substitution with a conductive shoe, clearly identifying the object as a conductive shoe and matching Conductive shoe (SCTID: 467430005). The main concept is a shoe with conductive properties; replacement context does not modify the object’s attributes. The category is Physical object. Parent concepts like generic Shoe are less specific, and related siblings like Antistatic or Nonconductive shoes do not match the stated conductivity. Hence, Conductive shoe is the correct code."
278900006,Türkiye (geographic location),Geographic location: Türkiye,"This entry identifies Türkiye specifically as a geographic location, with the label simply providing context and not altering the concept. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (Entity). The correct code is Türkiye (geographic location), SCTID 278900006. A generic parent such as Geographic location lacks specificity to the country named, and children or siblings denote other places. The contextual lead-in 'Geographic location:' is a field label and does not introduce additional attributes."
428249009,History of total lobectomy of lung (situation),Anamnesis: prior total lobectomy of lung,"The term 'anamnesis' signals medical history, and 'prior total lobectomy of lung' clarifies that a complete lung lobe removal occurred previously. The main concept is a historical situation of total lobectomy. The SNOMED category is Situation with explicit context, and the precise code is 428249009 History of total lobectomy of lung (situation). It is more exact than a generic lobectomy history and excludes partial lobectomy or other lung resections and pneumonectomy, ensuring parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate."
103807004,Factor XI inhibitor assay (procedure),Factor XI inhibitor test,"The term 'test' in clinical documentation commonly denotes a laboratory assay; here it specifically targets inhibitors to factor XI. No extra attributes are present. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This best maps to Factor XI inhibitor assay (103807004), not to parent concepts like generic inhibitor testing, nor siblings such as FXI activity testing or inhibitor tests for other coagulation factors. Using 'test' versus 'assay' is an acceptable synonym and does not change the code choice."
170432003,Administration of pre-school booster dose of vaccine product containing only Measles morbillivirus and Mumps orthorubulavirus and Rubella virus antigens (procedure),Measles/mumps/rubella pre-school booster done,"This shorthand confirms that the pre-school booster dose of the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine was done, i.e., administered. It is a Procedure. SCTID 170432003 is the precise match because it encodes administration of the pre-school booster for the MMR-only vaccine. Parent concepts such as general immunization or non-booster MMR administration are less specific, and siblings that include varicella (MMRV) or different dosing stages are not appropriate. Using the explicit antigen names is an equivalent synonym of MMR and does not introduce additional attributes."
33345009,Parafilaria bovicola (organism),Parafilaria bovicola species,"The entry specifies the taxonomic rank as species and names Parafilaria bovicola, which matches the organism concept. The category is Organism, with code 33345009. Parent concepts at genus or higher ranks are less specific. No clinical finding or disorder is implied by the wording; it simply denotes the species-level taxon, making the organism concept the most precise selection."
217117002,Hit against bottom when jumping into shallow water (event),Collision with the bottom when jumping into shallow water,"The entry captures the mechanism precisely: a collision with the water bottom occurring due to jumping into shallow water. No extra attributes (e.g., injury, timing, body part, severity) are present. SNOMED CT category is Event. 'Collision' is synonymous with 'hit' in this context and does not alter coding. This is more specific than generic striking events and differs from diving-related siblings, making SCTID 217117002 the most precise match."
701513001,Knee tibia trial prosthesis (physical object),Knee tibial trial prosthesis,"The entry names the physical device that is a trial prosthetic component for the tibial side of a knee joint. The main concept is a physical object: a temporary, intraoperative tibial component used during knee arthroplasty to assess fit. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This exactly matches SCTID 701513001, which is specific to the knee tibia trial prosthesis. Broader parent concepts like generic trial prosthesis or knee prosthesis component lack the tibial and trial specificity, and sibling items such as femoral or patellar trial prostheses would be incorrect. The wording is a direct synonym and does not introduce attributes like laterality, size, or material, so it remains uniquely codable to this concept."
416663004,Perfusion record (record artifact),Perfusion record archived,"This states the perfusion documentation artifact has been archived, maintaining focus on the record itself. It falls under the Record artifact category and is appropriately coded as “Perfusion record (record artifact)” SCTID 416663004. A generic archived record concept would be too broad, and sibling artifacts from other domains would be incorrect. The archival status does not alter the type of artifact or introduce new attributes."
218082000,Accident caused by handgun (event),Cause of incident documented as a handgun accident,"The phrasing identifies the incident’s cause as a handgun accident, conveying an accidental event with a handgun as the causative factor. Attributes are unintentional event and handgun causation. Category: Event. This maps cleanly to SCTID 218082000. Choosing a parent firearm accident concept would be too general, and mechanism-specific children (accidental discharge) or injury-related disorders are not supported by the wording."
421331003,Twice a day after meals (qualifier value),Instruction: twice-daily after meals,"The entry gives a succinct instruction containing the frequency (twice-daily) and the post-meal timing (“after meals”). The main concept is a combined timing/frequency qualifier value. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 421331003 is the most accurate code, since it represents exactly twice daily after meals. A parent like “twice-daily” alone would not capture the timing constraint, and siblings with different timing (e.g., with meals) or frequency would be incorrect. The hyphenated form is stylistic and equivalent."
735324008,Treatment escalation plan (record artifact),Treatment escalation plan confirmed,"The main concept is the confirmation of the presence of a Treatment escalation plan. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is best coded as SCTID 735324008, as it clearly denotes the specific artifact without introducing content from other plan types. Confirmation is a status about the artifact's existence and does not add clinical attributes that would shift coding."
244752000,Entire radiating portion of cortical lobule of kidney (body structure),Full radiating portion of cortical lobule of kidney,"“Full” functions as a clinically equivalent synonym for “entire/complete,” and the entry centers on the radiating portion of a renal cortical lobule. This is a Body structure. SNOMED CT 244752000 fits best because it captures the whole radiating portion (medullary ray). Broader anatomical parents or more general sibling terms without the completeness qualifier do not match as precisely. The statement does not add extraneous attributes."
1163278003,Self reported perceived control over food and/or nutrition behavior score (observable entity),Perceived control over food/nutrition behaviors—self-report score,"This phrase explicitly describes a self-report score of perceived control within food/nutrition behaviors, aligning exactly with SNOMED CT 1163278003. The primary concept is a scored observable derived from self-report in the dietary behavior domain emphasizing perceived control. Category: Observable entity. The wording excludes other constructs like general diet behavior scores (parent) or self-efficacy/confidence (siblings), and retains the scoring nature, making this concept-code pair the most accurate match."
702863003,Hand clinic (environment),Hand clinic,"The sole concept expressed is the clinical environment known as a hand clinic. This aligns directly with SNOMED CT 702863003, which is an Environment or geographical location concept. It does not imply an encounter, procedure, service, department, or specialty beyond the clinic dedicated to hand care. More generic parents like “Clinic (environment)” would be under-specified, and children or siblings such as “Outpatient clinic” or “Hand surgery clinic” add attributes (care type or specialty) not stated here. The simple noun phrase “Hand clinic” is a clinically equivalent expression of the exact environment and preserves the intended code."
362676006,Entire coccygeal region (body structure),Patient-described: whole tailbone area,"This is a patient-centered phrasing using lay terminology; “tailbone area” denotes the coccygeal region, and “whole” asserts completeness. It maps to the Body structure SNOMED CT 362676006 (Entire coccygeal region). Coding to the coccyx bone would be inappropriate because “area/region” is specified. A generic coccygeal region without completeness is less precise. No symptom or condition is stated."
224659006,Terraced bungalow (environment),Social history—home: terraced bungalow.,"This social history note lists the home as a terraced bungalow, focusing on environmental context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It maps exactly to Terraced bungalow (environment), SCTID 224659006, since both the terrace nature and bungalow form are specified. Choosing a parent like Bungalow (environment) would omit key detail, and a sibling such as Terraced house (environment) misrepresents the storey. The social history framing does not alter the core environmental concept."
242370003,Accidental ingestion of camphor (event),Accidentally swallowed camphor,"This entry describes an accidental swallowing event involving camphor, which is synonymous with accidental ingestion. No symptoms, dose, or outcomes are mentioned. The correct SNOMED CT category is Event, with SCTID 242370003 as the exact match. Parent categories or sibling disorder concepts are less appropriate because they either generalize the agent or imply toxicity not present in the statement."
705633004,Bioabsorbable vascular stent (physical object),Tray label: bioresorbable vascular stent,"The tray label names the device type as a bioresorbable vascular stent. This is a Physical object and maps directly to Bioabsorbable vascular stent (SCTID: 705633004). No additional details like vascular bed or drug elution are present, so parent or more specific child concepts are less appropriate. 'Bioresorbable' is a clinically equivalent synonym to bioabsorbable, preserving code precision."
433506004,Family history of total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (situation),Family history (procedure): total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO.,"The entry clarifies a procedural item in family history: total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO (bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy). The main concept is a family-history situation related to the specific combined procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Situation, and the most accurate code is 433506004. Parent concepts that generalize to hysterectomy or salpingo‑oophorectomy alone are not sufficiently specific, and sibling concepts regarding the patient's own surgical history would be incorrect. The abbreviation 'BSO' and the contextual label '(procedure)' do not alter the underlying meaning or code selection."
1365790004,Photographic extraoral image of face indicating detail of forensic interest (record artifact),Photographic extraoral facial record indicating detail of forensic interest,"This entry describes a photographic record of the face taken extraorally and indicates forensic-interest detail. Main concept: extraoral facial photographic record artifact with forensic relevance. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It is the most precise match due to inclusion of modality, anatomical focus, extraoral context, and forensic-interest qualifier. More general record artifacts or facial images without forensic indication would be parent-level and less specific; siblings involving other image types or sites would not match. The term “record” highlights artifact status without adding new attributes."
1306663004,Photographic extraoral image of full face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),"Full-face extraoral portrait photo, lips relaxed, jaws in centric relation.","The entry is a portrait-style extraoral photo of the full face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation, making it the described record artifact. It matches SNOMED CT 1306663004 (Record artifact). Without lip and CR details it would reduce to a parent concept; specifying different facial expressions or jaw positions would be sibling artifacts. The word “portrait” does not add clinical attributes and remains semantically equivalent to the intended image type."
1285488009,Structure of right paraesophageal lymph node below carina (body structure),"Localization: right paraesophageal lymph node, below the tracheal bifurcation","The phrase indicates localization of a lymph node adjacent to the esophagus on the right and positioned below the tracheal bifurcation, which is synonymous with the carina. This is an anatomical Body structure description. SNOMED CT 1285488009 exactly matches because it encodes a right paraesophageal lymph node below the carina. Parent concepts without laterality or without the carina-based positional qualifier are too broad. Sibling concepts like left paraesophageal lymph node below tracheal bifurcation or subcarinal lymph node refer to different sides or compartments. Using “tracheal bifurcation” is a clinically accepted synonym for the carina and maintains equivalence without added attributes."
223720002,Paraguay (geographic location),Paraguay (ISO country name),"Referencing “ISO country name” indicates the standardized naming convention but preserves the unique identification of the country Paraguay. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The concept Paraguay (geographic location), SCTID 223720002, is the correct match. No additional attributes such as region, time, or patient context are introduced. Broader parents (Country) are less specific, and child/sibling entities are not implied, so the Paraguay country concept is appropriate."
1306643006,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Dental record photograph: extraoral, left half-face at 45°, full smile, teeth in centric occlusion.","The entry references an extraoral dental photograph of the left half of the face in a 45° view, with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion, which is a Record artifact. SCTID 1306643006 precisely matches the specified image type. Broader categories (generic extraoral facial photograph) lack the defined angle and occlusal status, and sibling concepts (e.g., right oblique or intraoral images) are not appropriate. 'Dental record photograph' is a synonym indicating the same artifact without altering attributes."
57006002,Spiculocaulus orloffi (organism),Species identifier: Spiculocaulus orloffi,"The phrase labels the species name as an identifier, keeping the focus on the organism taxon. It belongs to the Organism hierarchy and matches SCTID 57006002. The wording does not add attributes like detection or infection, so parent or child clinical concepts are not indicated."
242144006,Accident involving wind-powered land vehicle (event),Clinic note: accident involving wind-powered land vehicle,"This clinic documentation identifies an accident event involving a wind-powered land vehicle, without specifying injury, mechanism, or timing beyond the event itself. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the precise code is “Accident involving wind-powered land vehicle (event)” SCTID 242144006. Parent concepts like general accidents are overly broad, while sibling concepts such as accidents involving motor vehicles or wind-powered watercraft would misrepresent the vehicle. The wording is a straightforward restatement of the concept and does not introduce new attributes."
373499006,Idoxuridine (substance),Medication list entry: idoxuridine,"This is a documentation context indicating that idoxuridine appears on a medication list by name, pointing to the substance identity. Category: Substance. The entry avoids specifying form, strength, or route, so the substance concept SCTID 373499006 is precise. Child concepts for specific products (e.g., ophthalmic drops) are not implied, and parent classes would be too broad."
878859007,Self management of diabetes (procedure),Engages in self-management for diabetes,"This narrative indicates that the patient engages in the activity of managing their diabetes themselves, aligning with 'Self management of diabetes (procedure)' 878859007. Category: Procedure. No new attributes like disease type, timing, or intervention specifics are introduced. It is more precise than a broad self-management category and does not shift to related but distinct concepts like education or self-monitoring. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
161478002,History of meningitis (situation),Past hx of meningitis,"The abbreviation 'hx' denotes history, and 'past' confirms prior context, indicating meningitis occurred previously without current illness or etiologic detail. This maps to the SNOMED Situation hierarchy. The correct code is History of meningitis (situation), SCTID 161478002. Parents are nonspecific, and etiologic children are not supported by the wording. It is not the same as the present disorder."
302408005,Removal of skin flap (procedure),Resection of skin flap,"‘Resection’ is semantically equivalent to excision/removal in surgical documentation when applied to a skin flap. It represents a Procedure and corresponds to SCTID 302408005. The entry does not introduce subtype (free vs pedicled) or specify extent (partial vs complete), thus avoiding child concepts. It also clearly distinguishes from siblings like graft removal or flap division, which are different actions."
702891006,Neurosurgery clinic (environment),Facility: neurosurgery clinic,"The entry labels the facility as the neurosurgery clinic, making the environment the highlighted concept. This is within the SNOMED CT category Environment or geographical location. The optimal code is 702891006 (Neurosurgery clinic [environment]). A more general parent (Clinic [environment]) would omit the specialty focus, and siblings that denote departments or inpatient wards would be incorrect. The text is a documentation label and does not introduce other clinical attributes or events; it uniquely denotes the clinic environment."
302459006,Excision of ganglion cyst of hand (procedure),Hand ganglion cyst removal (excision),"The entry specifies removal and clarifies it as excision of a hand ganglion cyst. Category: Procedure. “Removal (excision)” is a clinically equivalent phrasing that maintains the exact semantics required for SNOMED CT 302459006. It does not introduce details that would push coding toward children (e.g., subsite) or siblings (e.g., aspiration). Parent concepts without the hand site are insufficiently specific."
1306632003,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Chart attachment—extraoral photo, right half of face at 45 degrees, full smile, CO.","The entry presents an attached extraoral photo of the right half of the face at a 45-degree view, depicting a full smile with teeth in centric occlusion (CO). Category: Record artifact. 'Chart attachment' frames it as a record artifact without altering content attributes. More general or different-view/laterality artifacts would not fit; this precisely matches the detailed SNOMED description. CO abbreviates centric occlusion and is clinically equivalent."
405325000,Avulsion of subfascial perforating veins (procedure),Subfascial perforator vein avulsion—procedure,"The entry clearly states avulsion of subfascial perforator veins, with 'procedure' as a contextual label, matching the Procedure SCTID 405325000. Parent categories are too general, and sibling procedures with different techniques or approaches (e.g., ligation, endoscopic) would not fit. It avoids adding attributes such as laterality, timing qualifiers, or indications, ensuring precise coding."
6498005,Armillifer armillatus (organism),Armillifer armillatus — taxonomy entry,"This wording presents Armillifer armillatus as a taxonomy entry, emphasizing its classification rather than any clinical state. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism category with SCTID 6498005 for this species. The phrase does not assert detection, infection, or any attributes beyond identification of the organism. Using a parent concept (genus or broader group) would reduce specificity, and sibling taxa are not implied. The species organism concept is therefore the most precise match."
1373381006,American Joint Committee on Cancer aTis (qualifier value),AJCC TNM Tis with autopsy prefix (aTis),"This entry explicitly states Tis under AJCC TNM with the autopsy prefix 'a', yielding aTis. As a Qualifier value, it encodes the T category designation. The wording avoids additional clinical attributes and distinguishes it from broader or sibling qualifiers (e.g., generic Tis or c/p/y/r-prefixed Tis). Therefore, American Joint Committee on Cancer aTis is the most precise match."
411628005,Artocarpus heterophyllus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract of Artocarpus heterophyllus,"This statement identifies a diagnostic allergen extract derived from Artocarpus heterophyllus, which is the jackfruit source, and refers to the testing product. SNOMED CT category: Product. It is the precise concept coded as 411628005, avoiding any implication of therapeutic use, dosing, or test results. A parent like generic diagnostic allergen extract is less precise, and siblings such as therapeutic variants or different species would be inaccurate. The phrasing is a direct synonym that maintains the same clinical meaning."
223823006,Euboea (geographic location),Exposure location: Euboea,"The label pertains to an exposure-location field, but the coded concept is the place Euboea. Category: Geographic location. The exact match is Euboea (SCTID 223823006). Parent (Greece) is too broad, and child/sibling locations are not indicated. The entry does not add any specific exposure details, timing, or cause; it solely identifies the geographic location."
91940001,Allergy to walnut (finding),Walnut hypersensitivity,"The term ""hypersensitivity"" in clinical usage is a synonym for allergy when referring to immune-mediated reactions to a specific allergen; here, walnut is the allergen. No additional attributes such as severity, mechanism subtype, or timing are included. The best SNOMED CT code is Allergy to walnut (finding), SCTID 91940001, classified as a Clinical finding. Parent concepts like Allergy to tree nut or Allergy to food would be too broad, and sibling concepts involving other nuts or contact hypersensitivity are not specified. The synonym ""hypersensitivity"" does not alter the concept and remains equivalent to ""allergy"" in this context."
328702007,Gluten-free tagliatelle (product),Gluten-free tagliatelle noodles,"This colloquial use of 'noodles' still specifies tagliatelle and the gluten-free property, aligning with Gluten-free tagliatelle (product) (SCTID: 328702007). Category: Product. The synonym 'noodles' does not introduce new attributes; it is used informally for pasta strands. Broader parents or different gluten-free pasta shapes would be less accurate, and this entry does not add brand or preparation details that would warrant a child concept."
135866007,Partially informed of test results (situation),Test results communicated in part to patient,"This entry states that communication of test results to the patient occurred only in part, capturing partial informing. It is a Situation concept and codes to SCTID 135866007. More general parent concepts omit the essential 'in part' qualifier, while siblings expressing full or absent communication are not appropriate. The phrasing uses 'communicated' as a synonym for 'informed' and explicitly indicates partiality without introducing other attributes."
62303009,"Conductivity of nerve cell and nerve fiber, function (observable entity)",Neural conduction function of nerve cells and fibers,"The entry expresses the functional property of conduction in neural elements, explicitly limiting the target to nerve cells and nerve fibers. This is an Observable entity and corresponds to SCTID 62303009. It avoids implying measurement outcomes or procedural actions and does not introduce subtype distinctions. A parent concept of generic conduction function or nervous tissue conductivity would be broader, and sibling concepts like nerve conduction velocity, axonal conduction only, or motor/sensory conduction would be more specific than the wording here. The term 'neural conduction function' is a clinically safe synonym that maintains the same scope and meaning."
773439000,Hepatobiliary surgical care plan (record artifact),Follow-up note: hepatobiliary surgical care plan reviewed,"The entry embeds the care plan in follow-up documentation; “reviewed” is contextual and does not alter the artifact’s identity. The main concept remains a hepatobiliary surgical care plan, a Record artifact, which aligns with Hepatobiliary surgical care plan (773439000). No additional attributes such as timing, specific operations, or conditions are introduced, preventing drift to planned procedure (situation) or to other record artifacts like operative plans. The care plan is the precise focal artifact."
722124004,Radiology studies report (record artifact),Report of radiology studies,"This phrase unambiguously describes a report that summarizes radiology studies. The primary concept is a report arising from radiologic imaging; no body site, modality, or interpretation details are given. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It fits 722124004 precisely, being narrower than generic report concepts and not specific enough to map to any child such as MRI or CT study reports. The paraphrase preserves equivalence to the preferred term without adding attributes."
364666007,Ability to transfer location (observable entity),Capacity to transfer location,"Using 'capacity' instead of 'ability' is a common clinical synonym that does not change the meaning. It refers to the observable entity of the person’s capability to perform location transfer, aligning with SNOMED CT 364666007. No evaluation result or contextual attributes (assistance, surfaces, devices) are included, so child or sibling concepts are not indicated. Parent concepts that cover broader mobility capacities would be less precise. Thus, 364666007 is the appropriate code."
737431007,Coronary heart disease risk clinical management plan (record artifact),CHD risk clinical management plan finalized,"Finalization status indicates completion of the clinical management plan for CHD risk but does not change the core concept. The main concept is a plan artifact targeting coronary heart disease risk management. Category: Record artifact. SNOMED CT 737431007 is the exact match for such a plan. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts like CHD care plans for established disease or risk assessment reports misrepresent the intent, as the wording is about a plan to manage risk rather than treating diagnosed CHD or documenting risk calculations."
264370008,Museum (environment),Museum building,"This identifies the building as a museum, pointing specifically to 'Museum (environment)' SCTID 264370008. Category: Environment or geographical location. It does not introduce sublocations (e.g., gallery rooms) or specialized museum types, so child/sibling concepts are not more accurate. Parent concepts like 'Building (environment)' would be overly general. 'Building' clarifies the physical structure but remains equivalent to the museum environment concept."
372838003,Phenoxybenzamine (substance),Medication ingredient listed: phenoxybenzamine,"This statement lists phenoxybenzamine as an ingredient within a medication context but does not introduce product form, dose, or salt, keeping the focus on the substance. Main concept: phenoxybenzamine ingredient. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The appropriate code is Phenoxybenzamine (substance) SCTID 372838003; medicinal product codes or salt-specific substances would be too narrow, and class-level parents too broad."
418649002,Cardiac stepdown unit (environment),Cardiac stepdown unit identified,"Main concept: identification of the environment as the cardiac stepdown unit. No additional clinical details are provided. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The entry maps cleanly to SCTID 418649002. It does not suggest alternative units like CCU/ICU or a generic stepdown ward, keeping it more precise than parent/sibling concepts. The phrase indicates recognition of the same environment without altering meaning."
78387000,Asphyxiation by sustained compression of chest (event),Long-lasting chest compression causing asphyxiation,"Here, asphyxiation is the outcome attributed to long-lasting (sustained) chest compression, aligning precisely with SCTID 78387000 (Event). The phrasing maintains the required mechanism and duration, avoiding broader or different causes and not shifting into a disorder classification. General asphyxiation events or compression injuries without asphyxiation are less precise, making this concept the correct selection."
217497005,Accident caused by clothes on fire from controlled fire in private dwelling from normal charcoal fire (event),Home setting accident: clothes on fire caused by a controlled normal charcoal fire in a private dwelling.,"The entry details an accident in a home setting where clothes were on fire due to a controlled normal charcoal fire, explicitly in a private dwelling. This fits SNOMED Event SCTID 217497005. Parent concepts without source or location detail and siblings involving uncontrolled fires or non-charcoal sources are less appropriate. The synonyms used do not add any new attributes, maintaining the exact code selection."
399211009,History of myocardial infarction (situation),Medical history significant for MI.,"The entry states that the patient’s medical history includes myocardial infarction, a prior event. This is a situation-focused statement and aligns with 399211009. It does not introduce attributes such as MI type, severity, or timing, nor does it claim current infarction or objective ‘old MI’ findings. Parent concepts are broader; sibling or child concepts like acute MI would be inaccurate, making this the precise mapping."
1258880004,Ecchymosis following surgical procedure (finding),Postoperative ecchymosis.,"The main concept expressed is ecchymosis in the postoperative context. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT and aligns directly with SCTID 1258880004 “Ecchymosis following surgical procedure (finding).” The term “postoperative” is a standard synonym for “following surgical procedure,” and no additional attributes such as location, severity, or cause are introduced. A parent concept like “Ecchymosis (finding)” would omit the surgical temporal relation, and siblings such as “Hematoma following surgical procedure” describe a different phenomenon (a localized blood collection rather than superficial bruising), making the given code the most precise match."
224018001,Northwest Territories (geographic location),Service region noted as Northwest Territories (Canada),"Service region provides operational context; the location named is 'Northwest Territories' in Canada. Main concept: geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 224018001 is the precise code. Broader parents such as 'Canada' are not specific enough, and narrower child concepts (cities) are not mentioned. Sibling regions (e.g., 'Nunavut') are distinct territories and not implied."
29841000087106,Chaetomium perlucidum (organism),Patient notes: “Chaetomium perlucidum” on lab paperwork,"This patient-reported phrasing still centers on the organism name Chaetomium perlucidum, suitable for coding to the species-level Organism concept. Although it references lab paperwork, it introduces no attributes like infection, site, or timing beyond naming the organism. Genus-level or sibling species concepts would be incorrect, and disorder concepts would not apply because no disease state is asserted."
466834001,Visitor hygiene coverall (physical object),Visitor hygiene coverall issued,"The entry describes issuing the specific object, a visitor hygiene coverall, without altering the object’s identity. The main concept is the visitor-designated hygiene coverall as a physical item. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 466834001 best fits, whereas parent concepts like general coveralls or different PPE items would be less precise. The action 'issued' is contextual and does not introduce additional attributes."
711455000,Exposure to drug or medicament (event),Exposure to drug or medicament,"The documentation explicitly states exposure to a drug or medicament, with no additional qualifiers. The main concept is an exposure event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 711455000 precisely covers exposure to drug or medicament as an event. More general parents like exposure to substance or chemical are less specific, and sibling/child concepts involving adverse effects, toxicity, poisoning, or occupational/accidental exposure would add attributes not present. The wording mirrors the preferred term and is exactly aligned with the target concept."
405218005,Parenting behavior: early/middle childhood safety (observable entity),"Follow-up: parenting behavior, early/middle childhood safety","This entry identifies the follow-up topic as the observable entity of parenting behavior regarding safety for early/middle childhood. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 405218005 remains the precise code, as the safety domain and age range are the key attributes of the variable. A broader follow-up concept or another parenting domain would not reflect the wording. The follow-up context is not an added clinical attribute of the behavior itself."
16215451000119103,Specimen from right middle lobe of lung obtained by bronchial washing procedure (specimen),Bronchial washing sample—right middle lobe (lung).,"The entry conveys a specimen/sample derived via bronchial washing from the right middle lobe of the lung, which corresponds precisely to SNOMED CT concept 16215451000119103 in the Specimen hierarchy. It avoids extra details like segments or diagnostic results. A generic lung bronchial washing specimen would be too broad, and alternative methods (BAL, biopsy) would be siblings/others. “Sample” is a synonym for “specimen,” maintaining the intended concept."
39152007,Erythromycin stearate (substance),"Erythromycin stearate, macrolide antibiotic compound","Describing the compound as a macrolide antibiotic is a general class description and does not change the substance identification of erythromycin stearate. It remains in the Substance category and matches SCTID 39152007. The wording does not introduce medicinal product attributes or clinical administration details. A class-level macrolide concept would be too broad, and other erythromycin salts are not suggested."
24553000,Bovine adenovirus 1 (organism),Adenovirus bovine type 1,"The phrase 'Adenovirus bovine type 1' is a paraphrase that still denotes the same organism taxon: bovine adenovirus serotype 1. It introduces no additional clinical attributes and thus remains an Organism concept. The most precise SNOMED CT match is SCTID 24553000. Broader parent terms like 'bovine adenovirus' lack the specified serotype, and any sibling type would not align with 'type 1'. This synonym is semantically equivalent and does not change the code."
223882003,Hampshire (geographic location),Travel destination: Hampshire,"The phrase indicates Hampshire as a destination, and the coded concept is the location name. The main concept is a geographic location, appropriately represented by Hampshire (geographic location), SCTID 223882003. The travel context does not imply another geographic entity or a broader area; it avoids sibling confusion with “New Hampshire” or sublocations within Hampshire. Thus, the exact SNOMED geographic location concept is the best fit."
282270001,International System of Units unit of pressure (qualifier value),Pressure unit per International System of Units,"Main concept: pressure unit specified according to the International System of Units. Category: Qualifier value. This wording matches 282270001 by clearly tying pressure units to SI. It does not mention pascal/kilopascal (children), and it is more specific than general unit-of-pressure parents or non-SI siblings. The phrasing is a safe paraphrase of the preferred term, with identical semantic constraints and no extra attributes."
89547009,"Mixed lymphocyte culture response, function (observable entity)",Mixed lymphocyte culture response function discussed with patient,"This entry frames the concept in a patient communication context, but the central entity is still the mixed lymphocyte culture response function, an observable entity. There is no mention of testing, values, or interpretation, so SCTID 89547009 remains the correct mapping. More general or procedural concepts are avoided by specifying the function parameter explicitly."
387838000,Grass pollen specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Specific IgE for grass pollen,"Main concept: allergen-specific IgE where the allergen is grass pollen; no additional attributes are included. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This maps precisely to 387838000 because it names the exact allergenic target and the antibody type. A generic sIgE would be a parent concept and less precise, and other allergen targets would be siblings. The entry does not introduce positivity, levels, or procedures, so substance is the correct semantic category."
261481006,Occult carcinoma (qualifier value),Classification term: occult carcinoma,"This wording indicates the term is used as a classification label, aligning with the Qualifier value category (SCTID 261481006). No disease site, timing, or associated findings are included. Parent/sibling disorder or morphologic concepts would add unintended meaning; here the precise concept is the qualifier describing carcinoma as occult."
441195008,History of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy (situation),History positive for ACE inhibitor therapy,"This phrasing states that the patient’s history is positive for therapy with ACE inhibitors, i.e., past therapy occurred. Attributes include the therapy class and the historical context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and 'History of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy' is the specific match. It does not introduce current status or reactions, making parent/sibling concepts inappropriate. The wording remains semantically equivalent to 'history of ACE inhibitor therapy'."
1335924000,Specimen from head (specimen),Origin of specimen: head,"This is a clear declaration of the specimen's origin being the head, which fits SNOMED CT concept 1335924000 (Specimen from head) and the Specimen category. There are no details about the technique or subsite, so it does not imply child concepts like “Specimen from face” or method-specific specimens. It is more precise than a parent concept that lacks an anatomical site. The wording is a straightforward synonymic expression for the source and does not change code selection."
302978003,Accidentally struck by or against projected object (event),Patient accidentally struck by a projected object,"This documentation line reports the patient experienced an accidental impact from a projected object, which corresponds directly to SCTID 302978003. Main concepts: accidental mechanism and projected object contact; no mention of injuries, body site, timing, or severity is made. SNOMED CT category: Event. The specification of a projected object ensures it is not the broader parent of any object impact. It avoids siblings like falling object or moving object. The paraphrase “struck by” is a clinically equivalent expression for “struck by or against,” not changing the code selection."
165479004,Poikilocytosis (finding),Assessment: poikilocytosis,"In an assessment context, this entry documents poikilocytosis, the finding of abnormal RBC shape variation. It is a Clinical finding and aligns with SCTID 165479004. No severity, etiology, or subtype is mentioned. Because it specifically identifies shape variation, parent concepts such as abnormal RBC morphology are less precise, and child concepts specifying particular abnormal shapes are not appropriate."
258498002,Conjunctival swab (specimen),Sample source: conjunctiva (swab),"This entry identifies the source of the swab sample as the conjunctiva, making it a conjunctival swab specimen. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The specificity to conjunctiva aligns with Conjunctival swab (specimen) SCTID 258498002 rather than a broader ocular swab specimen. The parentheses clarify the collection method without changing the concept to a procedure or adding extraneous attributes."
223968002,Welsh counties (geographic location),County in Wales,"This entry refers to the county-level geographic unit within the country of Wales. Category: Location — Geographic location. Though singular phrasing, it still refers to the class of Welsh counties as the target concept and fits SCTID 223968002 rather than any specific county child concept. It is not the broader country concept and introduces no supplementary attributes."
413092009,Patient receives copy of referral letter (finding),Documentation: patient received copy of referral letter.,"This documentation note records the finding that the patient received a copy of the referral letter. It is a Clinical finding and maps to SNOMED CT 413092009. The contextual prefix “Documentation:” does not alter the clinical meaning. The specificity to a referral letter ensures this is not a broader communication concept or a different letter type, making this code the most precise choice."
411891005,Staphylococcal enterotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),TSST allergen extract from Staphylococcus (diagnostic),"The entry refers to a diagnostic allergen extract derived from staphylococcal TSST. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The phrase “TSST allergen extract” is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and maintains precise specificity, mapping to SCTID 411891005. It avoids the broader parent category and distinguishes itself from sibling concepts for other staphylococcal antigens. No extraneous attributes are introduced."
719761003,Maternal history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (situation),Mother affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"The entry states that the mother is affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus, clearly a family history context and not the patient’s own condition. No additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. The appropriate concept is 719761003 (Maternal history of diabetes mellitus type 1). Broader family-history codes omit maternal specificity, while maternal history of diabetes unspecified type fails to capture the explicit type 1 designation."
45361000087104,Pulmonary valve ventriculoarterial mean gradient (observable entity),Measurement: mean gradient across the pulmonary valve,"This indicates a measurement of the mean transvalvular gradient for the pulmonary valve. Category: Observable entity. The specification of mean and valve location prevents mapping to generic or peak gradients and excludes other valves, keeping the selection precise for the SNOMED CT concept 'Pulmonary valve ventriculoarterial mean gradient.'"
466452007,"Vinyl examination/treatment glove, non-powdered (physical object)",Vinyl examination glove—no powder,"The entry states a vinyl examination glove and explicitly indicates no powder, which equates to non-powdered. The concept is a medical supply object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It matches 466452007 by specifying exam/treatment purpose, vinyl, and non-powdered status. Using broader parents would lose detail, while siblings for other materials or powdered gloves would contradict the text."
223693003,Guatemala (geographic location),Guatemala — sovereign nation,"“Sovereign nation” is a descriptive synonym for the country-level geographic entity; it still references Guatemala as a country. The main concept remains the national geographic location of Guatemala without added contextual detail. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). This is not about residency or origin; thus, situation findings are excluded. It neither broadens to regions nor narrows to localities, supporting precise coding to SCTID 223693003."
736383008,Major neurosurgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Neurosurgery major inpatient plan of care,"This entry expresses a plan-of-care record for an inpatient within the neurosurgery specialty designated as major, ensuring the core attributes of care plan, inpatient setting, neurosurgery, and major severity class. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and corresponds precisely to 736383008 Major neurosurgery inpatient care plan (record artifact). More general parents such as Inpatient plan of care or Major surgery plan of care fail to specify neurosurgery, and siblings like Minor neurosurgery inpatient plan of care would misstate the magnitude. The word order variation does not change the intended meaning."
122575003,Urine specimen (specimen),Test specimen (urine),"The phrase indicates that the specimen (for testing context) is urine, without specifying a particular test or collection protocol. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the most accurate code is Urine specimen (specimen) SCTID 122575003. It does not imply a diagnostic procedure code or a specialized child specimen (e.g., 24-hour urine), so those alternatives are less appropriate."
440140008,History of cerebrovascular accident with residual deficit (situation),History of brain attack with residual deficit,"The phrase uses 'brain attack' as a colloquial synonym for stroke and states residual deficit remains, clearly indicating a past event with sequelae. Category: Situation. This should be coded as 'History of cerebrovascular accident with residual deficit.' A disorder code for acute stroke or sequelae-only would not reflect the historical framing, and a history without residuals would omit the deficits. 'Brain attack' is an accepted lay synonym for cerebrovascular accident; 'residual deficit' maintains equivalence without new attributes."
280662007,Entire retinal pigment epithelium (body structure),History note: reviewed the entire retinal pigment epithelium anatomy,"Despite the history note context, the concept itself is the entire RPE anatomy. This is a Body structure. SCTID 280662007 matches because it captures the complete RPE. A generic RPE concept would be less specific, and any variant with laterality or partial anatomy would introduce attributes not present in the entry."
161453001,History of obesity (situation),History of obesity noted by clinician,"This entry documents a clinician’s note that the patient has a history of obesity, clearly indicating a historical context. The main concept is obesity in a history frame. The correct SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and the precise code is 161453001. It should not be coded as active Obesity (disorder), and there is no suggestion of family history or other attributes like severity or timing beyond the history context."
417382006,Petasites hybridus extract (substance),Butterbur botanical extract,"The wording employs the common name “butterbur” and clarifies it is a botanical extract, which is equivalent to Petasites hybridus extract without added qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches Petasites hybridus extract (substance) [417382006]. Parents that are generic botanical extracts are overly broad, and children/siblings focused on particular plant parts, extraction methods, or commercial products introduce specificity not present in this neutral substance designation."
276390003,Stool like rabbit's (finding),BM described as rabbit pellets,"The entry notes a bowel movement (BM) described specifically as rabbit pellets, focusing on stool appearance only. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. The phrase is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of 'stool like rabbit's', so SCTID 276390003 is the most accurate code. Parent concepts like 'abnormal bowel sounds' or 'abnormal feces' are broader, and siblings such as 'scybalous stool' or 'Bristol type 1' lack the explicit rabbit-dropping analogy, hence they are less suitable."
170997003,Counseled by counselor (situation),Patient reports having been counseled by a counselor.,"The patient’s statement indicates counseling occurred and identifies the provider as a counselor. The main concept is counseling by a counselor, which is a Situation with explicit context. It maps specifically to 'Counseled by counselor (situation)' SCTID 170997003. The information source (patient report) does not add prohibited attributes like cause or timing beyond the inherent occurrence. Parent and sibling concepts not specifying this provider type are less accurate."
127926002,Structure of highest mediastinal lymph node (body structure),Highest mediastinal lymph node—site documented,"The entry documents the anatomical site as the highest mediastinal lymph node, maintaining singular and specific reference. SNOMED CT category: Body structure (anatomical structure). This maps directly to SCTID 127926002 without adding laterality, size, or disease state. Broader mediastinal lymph node structures or alternative regional nodes would be less precise than the ‘highest’ designation."
422461009,Dissatisfied with sexual relationship (finding),Sexual relationship—patient dissatisfied.,"The concept is the patient’s dissatisfaction with their sexual relationship, a Clinical finding. SCTID 422461009 is the best match. Parent categories that broadly describe relationship issues, and sibling concepts such as sexual dysfunction or dissatisfaction with sex life, do not align with the explicit relationship-centered dissatisfaction. The dash-separated phrasing does not alter the concept or add attributes."
982282631000119107,History of serous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy of ovary (situation),"Prior diagnosis of ovarian serous cystadenoma, borderline malignancy","The entry specifies a prior diagnosis, establishing history-of context, and names the disorder precisely as ovarian serous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy. This is a SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context. The most precise concept is History of serous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy of ovary (982282631000119107). Coding instead to the disorder concept would fail to capture the past context, and more generic history concepts or those for different histologies (e.g., mucinous) or malignancy levels (benign or frankly malignant) would be less accurate than this specific borderline serous cystadenoma history."
228216002,Culottes (physical object),Culottes recorded on property check,"Here the object 'culottes' is documented during a property check, with the principal concept being the garment. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The administrative context does not add attributes to the item or change the nature of the coded concept. Mapping to generic 'clothing' would be less specific, and siblings like 'trousers' or 'skirt' are not equivalent. Culottes (physical object) is the most precise code for the named item."
700239008,History of malignant neoplasm of renal pelvis (situation),Patient reports prior cancer in the renal pelvis,"The patient’s self-report still documents a past occurrence of malignant neoplasm specifically in the renal pelvis. The concept is history-of renal pelvis cancer, with the context clearly past (“prior”). SNOMED CT categorizes history-of conditions as Situations with explicit context, and SCTID 700239008 matches the exact site and malignancy. This is not a current disorder, nor is it a family history entry. No histologic subtype or laterality is introduced, avoiding inappropriately specific child codes."
349893001,Product containing ergoline derivative (product),Dispensed medication: ergoline derivative product,"The phrase documents a dispensed medication and identifies it as an ergoline derivative product, which is a product-level classification. The SNOMED category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product; the precise code is Product containing ergoline derivative (product) 349893001. No specific active ingredient or formulation is named, avoiding child concepts such as specific ergoline derivative products. The dispensing context is not an attribute of the product that would change coding. Substance concepts are incorrect because the entry refers to a dispensed medication product."
716566005,Test of Word Finding Third Edition score (observable entity),Report lists the TWF-3 score,"The text indicates that the report contains the score from the Test of Word Finding, Third Edition. The concept represented is the score itself, an Observable entity. SCTID 716566005 is the correct code for the TWF-3 score. The documentation context does not introduce interpretation, values, or other attributes. A generic word finding test score or a different edition would be inaccurate, and a procedural or interpretive finding concept would not reflect the score as an observable."
301483000,Difficulty avoiding obstacles in path (finding),Difficulty going around objects that are in the way,"The entry conveys difficulty going around objects that obstruct the path, directly reflecting obstacle avoidance difficulty. Category: Clinical finding. The wording is a patient-friendly synonym and introduces no cause, severity, or timing. Using a parent like general mobility impairment or a sibling like stumbling would be less accurate. SCTID 301483000 best matches."
411508001,"Ethyleneurea,melamineformaldehyde (Fix.Ac) (product)","Stock check: Ethyleneurea, melamine formaldehyde (Fix.Ac) product","This stock check reference identifies the product without adding attributes like quantity or packaging. It refers specifically to the Ethyleneurea, melamine formaldehyde (Fix.Ac) product. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 411508001 is the correct code. Mapping to generic stock management or other product classes would be less precise, and sibling fixative concepts would not match the named composition. The context remains administrative and does not modify coding."
430581006,Mycobacterium doricum (organism),Organism name: Mycobacterium doricum,"The text presents the organism field value as “Mycobacterium doricum,” referring directly to the species. It does not assert infection, specimen, or site; it simply names the organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The most precise code is Mycobacterium doricum (430581006). Parent categories (genus-level or broader) lack the species specificity here, and siblings (other species) do not match. No child details (e.g., strain) are provided, so the species-level organism concept is correct."
53902004,Uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (substance),UDP N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase,"Removing the hyphen between UDP and N does not alter the identity of the enzyme; it still refers to the same specific substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The term pinpoints the particular 2-epimerase acting on UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, aligning with SCTID 53902004. Broader parent groupings (enzyme/epimerase) lack the substrate specificity in the name, and any sibling concepts (e.g., different UDP sugar epimerases) would be inaccurate. No extra attributes (e.g., recombinant, species, activity) are implied, keeping the mapping exact."
411737000,Origanum vulgare diagnostic allergen extract (product),Oregano allergen extract for diagnostic purposes,"This describes an allergen extract sourced from oregano, specifically for diagnostic use, indicating the product form and purpose. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It maps to SCTID 411737000 since “oregano” corresponds to Origanum vulgare, and the diagnostic qualifier excludes therapeutic preparations. A parent concept would be too general, and a substance concept lacks the product context. The wording is a safe paraphrase that does not introduce dose, route, or procedural detail."
727221009,Entire epidermal basement zone (body structure),Histologic location: epidermal basement zone,"This phrasing situates the anatomical structure within a histologic context but still names only the epidermal basement zone, aligning with SNOMED CT 727221009. Category: Body structure. No additional attributes such as findings or severity are present. More general histologic locations would be too broad, and membrane-only components would be too narrow. The wording remains an exact representation of the full zone."
37525001,Roatelo (organism),Taxonomic identification: Roatelo,"This statement indicates a taxonomic identification of Roatelo, precisely matching SNOMED CT Roatelo (SCTID 37525001) within the Organism category. No attributes such as presence, pathogenicity, or severity are introduced; it is purely a naming of the taxon. Parent-level Organism concepts are less specific, and child/sibling taxa would be different organisms. The wording is synonymous with naming the organism and preserves the exact code."
11003531000119101,History of acquired deformity of left hip following removal of prosthesis (situation),Orthopedic history documented: acquired left hip deformity after removal of prosthetic hip.,"This is clearly a documented past orthopedic history and specifies acquired deformity, left hip, and occurrence after removal of a prosthetic hip. “Prosthetic hip” is a clinically equivalent way to say hip prosthesis. The most specific fit is the Situation concept “History of acquired deformity of left hip following removal of prosthesis” (SCTID: 11003531000119101). Parent concepts are less specific; sibling or child concepts for other laterality or for current deformity would not match. No added attributes like severity or timing beyond the post-removal relation are present."
36431000087105,Genus Zasmidium (organism),Clinical record organism: Zasmidium genus,"This entry uses a clinical-record context while naming only the organism at genus level, Zasmidium. It belongs to the Organism category and corresponds to the Genus Zasmidium concept in SNOMED CT. The phrase does not introduce detection status, body site, or disease, so it is not a Finding or Disorder. Neither parent taxa nor child species are mentioned, and siblings are excluded. The wording is equivalent to the genus concept and supports the same code."
73717009,Muconate cycloisomerase (substance),Muconate cycloisomerase protein,"The phrase identifies the entity as a protein named muconate cycloisomerase, which is semantically the same biochemical substance. SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise match is Muconate cycloisomerase [73717009]. The term 'protein' here is a descriptor of its molecular nature and does not imply a different code. Parent concepts like Protein (substance) lack specificity, and child/sibling distinctions such as isoforms or variants are not implied."
429608005,Reshaping of cranium (procedure),Primary operation: cranium reshaping,"This denotes the primary operation as reshaping of the cranium with no added attributes such as indication or method. The main concept is a surgical reshaping of the cranium. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It fits Reshaping of cranium (429608005). Parent concepts would be nonspecific, and sibling/child concepts (e.g., cranioplasty, vault remodeling) introduce different scope or intent not contained in the wording."
223857003,Devil's island (geographic location),Chart notes reference: Devil's Island,"This indicates that chart notes reference the place ‘Devil’s Island,’ making the geographic location the single concept to code. The correct SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, with SCTID 223857003. The contextual wording does not introduce additional attributes. Parent concepts are too broad, and similarly named siblings are not suggested; the explicit name maps directly to Devil’s island (geographic location)."
223747007,Flores (geographic location),Encounter location: Flores,"Here, 'Flores' is the named geographic location relevant to an encounter; the codable concept is the toponym alone. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). The exact match is Flores (geographic location) SCTID 223747007. Parent concepts like 'Geographic location' are too broad, and child/sibling concepts that clarify type (e.g., island, city, department) would not be justified. Using 'Encounter location' provides context only and does not change code selection for the place name."
361014003,Structure of epiphysis of pubis (body structure),Exam reference: epiphysis of the pubis,"This documentation-style phrase points to the anatomical epiphysis of the pubis. It is clearly a Body structure and avoids added attributes such as laterality or disease. Parent terms (pubic bone) or sibling entities (ramus of pubis, symphysis) do not match the specificity. The synonym is directly equivalent to the preferred term, indicating SCTID 361014003."
705736004,Surgical anchor (physical object),Anchor used in surgery,"The phrase denotes an anchor whose domain is surgical use, which is fully consistent with the concept Surgical anchor (physical object). No additional attributes like location, mechanism, or subtype are introduced. Coding to broader device categories would lose specificity, and coding to child concepts would add assumptions not present in the text."
13352000,Bidirectional cardiovascular shunt (finding),Impression: bidirectional cardiovascular shunt,"This imaging or clinical impression documents a bidirectional cardiovascular shunt, a Clinical finding. The entry corresponds to SNOMED CT 13352000 by indicating flow in both directions within the cardiovascular system without specifying the anatomical site or etiology. Using the general cardiovascular context avoids narrowing to intracardiac or ductal subtypes, and the explicit bidirectionality makes it more specific than the parent shunt finding while ruling out sibling single-direction shunts."
466239004,Wheelchair overhead suspension sling (physical object),Wheelchair overhead suspension sling noted on assessment,"An assessment note identifies the device as a wheelchair overhead suspension sling, maintaining specificity. Main concept: device for overhead suspension used with wheelchairs. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). Context does not change the object; it remains equivalent to the FSN. Parent/sibling alternatives (generic overhead slings or non-overhead wheelchair items) are less accurate. SCTID 466239004 is the best match."
789387009,Estimated oral intake of caffeinated beverages in 24 hours (observable entity),Clinician-estimated 24-hour oral intake of caffeinated beverages,"This entry specifies that the estimate is by a clinician, but the observable remains the estimated oral intake of caffeinated beverages across 24 hours. The key attributes—oral route, caffeinated beverages, 24-hour duration, estimated—are intact. It qualifies as an Observable entity. SCTID 789387009 aligns exactly, while broader concepts without time or caffeine specificity, and siblings for measured intake or non-oral sources, would be less suitable. The addition of 'clinician-estimated' is consistent with estimation and does not change the concept."
107327005,Family Acipensiridae (organism),Sturgeon family (Acipenseridae),"The entry uses the common name 'sturgeon' paired with the scientific family name 'Acipenseridae,' explicitly specifying the taxonomic rank as family. In SNOMED CT, the Organism concept Family Acipensiridae (organism), SCTID 107327005, is the precise match. Parent concepts (e.g., the order Acipenseriformes) would be too general, and child concepts (e.g., genus Acipenser or Huso) would be too specific. The synonym 'sturgeon family' is a standard, rank-accurate paraphrase and does not introduce new attributes."
1229916009,American Joint Committee on Cancer pM1 (qualifier value),Pathology-based AJCC M1 (pM1),"This wording clarifies that the AJCC M1 status is based on pathology, i.e., pM1. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. 'Pathology-based' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the 'p' prefix and does not introduce any additional attributes such as site or subtype, ensuring an exact match to AJCC pM1 rather than cM1 or other M values."
216193006,"Hit by object falling from aircraft, without accident to aircraft, occupant of commercial aircraft in surface to air transport injured (event)",Case summary: struck by object falling from aircraft as an occupant of a commercial aircraft; no accident to the aircraft; injured.,"This case summary describes a commercial aircraft occupant struck by an object falling from the aircraft, with injury and no accident to the aircraft. It is an Event in SNOMED CT. SCTID 216193006 is the best match because it contains all specified attributes. Parent concepts lacking aircraft specificity or siblings related to aircraft accidents are less suitable given the explicit exclusion of an aircraft accident. The use of ‘struck’ versus ‘hit’ is clinically equivalent and does not change the selection."
214462002,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving injury by moving part of the vehicle while boarding or alighting, passenger on motor cycle injured (event)",Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident: motorcycle passenger injured by moving vehicle part while boarding.,"The entry explicitly describes a noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving a motorcycle, specifies the injured person is a passenger, and states the injury occurred due to a moving part of the vehicle during boarding. These attributes match the SNOMED CT event concept 214462002. The category is Event. Parent concepts such as generic noncollision motor vehicle traffic accidents are too broad because they omit the specific mechanism (moving part) and the phase (boarding/alighting) and passenger status. Sibling concepts like driver injured or collision events would be incorrect because this entry excludes collision and identifies a passenger. The wording uses standard synonyms (motorcycle for motor cycle, boarding for boarding) that are clinically equivalent and do not alter the code selection."
26043007,Jacquina macrocarpa (organism),Scientific name: Jacquina macrocarpa,"This entry presents the scientific binomial Jacquina macrocarpa as the named taxon, which directly corresponds to the organism concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It is the best fit for SCTID 26043007 and does not add attributes like specimen part, extract, or clinical events. A parent concept (e.g., Jacquina genus or general plant organism) would be less specific, and no child (subspecies) or sibling species is indicated."
390771008,Improvement of status (qualifier value),Improvement of status,"The entry directly names the qualifier value concept 'Improvement of status,' indicating that the current status has improved without introducing cause, severity, timing, or specific clinical details. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, which is appropriate for describing a status change. This is the most precise match because it conveys improvement as a status descriptor, not a clinical course or outcome. Parent or sibling qualifiers such as 'Worsening of status,' 'No change in status,' 'Stable,' or 'Resolved' are not indicated. It also avoids the sibling 'Improving' (clinical course) because it frames improvement as a status label rather than a trajectory."
223753007,Hokkaido (geographic location),Location: Hokkaido,"This documentation-style phrasing uses Hokkaido as a location value, which still denotes the geographic entity itself and aligns with SNOMED CT 223753007 Hokkaido (geographic location) within the Location hierarchy. The label 'Location' is contextual and does not introduce attributes about the place; it does not specify administrative status, country, or time. Parent concepts would be overly broad, and child/sibling concepts would represent other places, so the specific Hokkaido concept is the most accurate."
247580009,Intellectual faculties (observable entity),Mental status domain: intellectual faculties,"This heading identifies intellectual faculties as a domain within mental status examination, but it remains a neutral observable attribute. The concept belongs to the SNOMED CT category Observable entity. SCTID 247580009 matches the intended scope—general intellectual faculties—without suggesting specific subcomponents or outcomes. Broader parents like cognitive function would be less specific, while narrower siblings (memory, intelligence quotient) are not explicitly referenced. Contextual ‘mental status domain’ does not add attributes or results."
389014005,Genus Chrysospalax (organism),Chrysospalax taxonomic genus,"This phrase identifies “Chrysospalax” specifically as a taxonomic genus, without any species-level detail or clinical qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The precise match is Genus Chrysospalax (389014005). Parent concepts (higher taxa) and sibling genera would be less appropriate, and child concepts (species) are not indicated. The synonymic phrasing is consistent with genus-level identification and does not introduce new attributes."
309189008,Tongue biopsy specimen (specimen),Specimen: tongue biopsy,"This is a common laboratory/pathology label indicating the specimen nature (“Specimen”) and type (“tongue biopsy”). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It precisely corresponds to SCTID 309189008, as it denotes a specimen obtained by a biopsy of the tongue. Broader or different-site parent/sibling concepts would be less accurate, and the procedure concept would misrepresent the material vs. the act."
223639001,Liechtenstein (geographic location),Liechtenstein — documented location,"This conveys that the documented location value is Liechtenstein and introduces no residence or travel attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 223639001 precisely represents the country. Parent concepts are too broad, while sibling or child geographic entities (e.g., municipalities) are not indicated. The expression is a straightforward, semantically equivalent reference to the location."
700669005,Arthritis transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation system (physical object),Physical therapy equipment list: arthritis transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation system,"The listing identifies the arthritis-specific TENS system among physical therapy equipment, focusing on the device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The entry’s content matches the arthritis TENS system and does not add attributes beyond naming the item. A generic parent TENS system would be less precise, and there is no implication of electrodes or other parts, supporting SCTID 700669005."
161927003,Night cough present (situation),Patient confirms night cough present,"The patient confirmation denotes that night cough is present. This fits the Situation with explicit context category and maps to SNOMED CT 161927003 Night cough present (situation). Using nocturnal cough as a finding would omit the explicit confirmation of presence, while cough present without the night qualifier would be too broad. The phrasing maintains the same clinical meaning without added attributes."
42983006,Structure of Descemet's membrane (body structure),Descemet membrane (cornea),"This uses a common synonym “Descemet membrane” with the clarifying parenthetical “cornea,” both of which refer to the same anatomical layer. No laterality, condition, or state is implied. It is a Body structure concept and maps exactly to Structure of Descemet's membrane. Broader corneal structures or other corneal layers would be less appropriate. The synonym does not introduce any new attribute and thus maintains the same code selection."
96050003,Cefpodoxime proxetil (substance),"Cefpodoxime proxetil, proxetil form","The phrase clarifies that the form is the proxetil ester of cefpodoxime, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT Cefpodoxime proxetil (substance), SCTID 96050003. It avoids product, dosing, or route details. Parent cephalosporin classes are too general, and sibling “cefpodoxime (substance)” would miscode by omitting the ester specification. The synonymic wording remains clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
430745006,Carbamic acid (substance),Target compound—carbamic acid,"This entry designates carbamic acid as the compound of interest but does not report detection or measurement, thus remaining purely a substance reference. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, matching SCTID 430745006. Mapping to observables or findings would require presence or quantification, which is absent here. Parent or sibling chemical classes would be less precise than the exact carbamic acid substance."
701601004,Antimicrobial sock (physical object),Antimicrobial sock issued,"This line shows the item issued is an antimicrobial sock, making the physical object the focus. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 701601004 should be used because it identifies the antimicrobial sock explicitly. The issuance context does not add attributes altering the code. A generic sock parent is too broad without antimicrobial detail, and alternative product types (compression sock, stocking) are not indicated."
714335001,Lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy report (record artifact),Lower GI endoscopy report uploaded to EMR,"This documents that the lower GI endoscopy report has been uploaded to the electronic medical record. The concept is a record artifact tied to lower GI endoscopy, aligning with SCTID 714335001. The upload action is system context and does not alter the artifact type. It is not a generic GI report (parent) and does not specify a particular lower GI procedure (child), making the match precise."
770574001,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography report (record artifact),ERCP report documented,"The entry notes that an ERCP report has been documented, maintaining focus on the report artifact rather than clinical content. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 770574001 is the precise code for the ERCP report. Parent concepts like 'clinical documentation' are nonspecific, and 'ERCP procedure' is not a record artifact. 'Documented' is a workflow descriptor that does not modify the artifact type."
170786005,Thyroid symptom change (finding),Review: thyroid symptom change,"The entry indicates that on review, a change in thyroid symptoms is noted, without specifying improvement or worsening. The main concept is neutral change in thyroid symptom status; the 'review' context does not alter the clinical meaning. Category: Clinical finding. This maps to Thyroid symptom change (170786005) due to its thyroid specificity and neutral description. A generic parent like symptom change would be underspecified, and child or sibling concepts with directional qualifiers are not appropriate."
16215691000119106,Specimen from right upper lobe of lung obtained by bronchial aspiration procedure (specimen),Right upper lobe bronchial aspiration specimen,"Main concept: specimen identified as collected by bronchial aspiration from the right upper lobe. Attributes: method (bronchial aspiration) and site (RUL). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps directly to concept 16215691000119106, which encodes both the lobe and acquisition method. Parent concepts missing specificity and sibling methods like lavage do not match the phrasing, ensuring precise and unique coding to this specimen concept."
411688008,Fagopyrum esculentum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic use allergen extract—Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat),"This entry indicates an allergen extract for diagnostic use and specifies the source as Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat), identifying the product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It is best coded to 411688008. The common/scientific names are clinically equivalent synonyms. Parent generic diagnostic extract or sibling therapeutic extract concepts are less appropriate."
705009009,Posterior ST segment depression (finding),Inpatient ECG report notes posterior ST segment depression,"The report notes posterior ST segment depression, which is an ECG Clinical finding. The exact SNOMED CT concept is Posterior ST segment depression (finding), SCTID 705009009. The inpatient context and report format are incidental. Choosing a broader ST depression code would lose the posterior localization, and other regional ST depression concepts would not fit the statement."
240328004,Removal of pancreatic tissue from donor (procedure),Pancreas tissue removal from donor,This is a paraphrase indicating removal of tissue of the pancreas from a donor. Category: Procedure. 'Pancreas tissue' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'pancreatic tissue' and does not imply whole-organ removal. It is specific enough to avoid mapping to parent-level donor tissue removal and avoids child/sibling concepts tied to complete organ or subcomponent (islets) procedures. SCTID 240328004 is the correct selection.
709125009,3-hydroxyanthranilate (substance),3-hydroxyanthranilate compound name,"The entry indicates that the compound name in question is 3-hydroxyanthranilate, keeping the focus on the substance identity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 709125009 best represents this exact chemical entity. Parent terms lacking positional specificity or sibling acid forms do not match. The phrase 'compound name' is contextual and does not introduce attributes like status, quantity, or detection; it still codes to the same substance."
309999004,Warden controlled accommodation (environment),Warden-controlled residence,"This entry describes a residence that is under warden control, which is a synonymous expression of warden-controlled accommodation. SNOMED CT category: Environment. “Residence” is a safe synonym for accommodation and, coupled with “warden-controlled,” maps precisely to Warden controlled accommodation (environment). It avoids general accommodation (parent) and care-focused siblings like assisted living or nursing homes. No new attributes are introduced; thus the code selection remains unchanged."
258571003,Machine hemodialysate specimen (specimen),Machine hemodialysate specimen,"The entry explicitly denotes a specimen of hemodialysate obtained from a machine, identifying the substance (hemodialysate) and the source (machine). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This wording precisely matches SNOMED CT 258571003 Machine hemodialysate specimen and is more specific than parent concepts such as generic dialysate specimen. It does not suggest peritoneal dialysate, dialysis water, blood, or any other sibling specimen types. No added attributes (timing, condition, severity) are introduced."
223676003,Ireland (geographic location),Imaging site: Ireland,"Ireland is identified as the imaging site location. Category: Geographical location. The diagnostic context does not change the geographic entity; therefore SCTID 223676003 is the precise mapping. Parent categories (e.g., Country) are too general, and sibling/child concepts like specific cities or the island are not indicated; the country name is the only place referenced."
264379009,Sports stadium (environment),Sports stadium area,"‘Area’ here refers to the spatial environment of a sports stadium and does not add attributes such as the specific sport or event. In SNOMED CT, this is an Environment and should be coded as Sports stadium (environment) [264379009]. Broader or different venue types (stadium in general, sports facility, arena) would not match the explicit stadium-for-sports meaning captured here."
309171007,Lower respiratory fluid specimen (specimen),Lower respiratory fluid specimen,"The entry explicitly denotes a specimen consisting of fluid from the lower respiratory tract. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 309171007 (Lower respiratory fluid specimen) is the most precise match because it targets fluid derived from lower airways without specifying a particular collection method or subtype. Broader parent concepts such as Respiratory fluid specimen or Body fluid specimen would omit the lower tract specificity, and child/sibling concepts like sputum specimen, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen, or tracheal aspirate specimen add procedural or material specifics not stated here."
261882005,LM 294 (qualifier value),Set to LM 294,"The entry indicates a value setting to LM 294, fitting the idea of a qualifier value assigned in a record. Category: Qualifier value. It does not imply clinical conditions or test measurements. Parent 'Qualifier value' is too broad; other LM settings are siblings. LM 294 is the precise concept needed."
701353004,Positive-pressure needleless valve-connector (physical object),Positive-pressure needleless valve connector—on-hand equipment,"The entry names the device and indicates availability in inventory, but the coded concept is the object itself. SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It aligns precisely with SCTID 701353004 through inclusion of the positive-pressure and valve features, staying more specific than a generic needleless connector and not implying a different pressure type or mechanism."
411958002,Parietaria judaica specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Clinic stock: Parietaria judaica diagnostic allergen extract,"This stock note lists 'Parietaria judaica diagnostic allergen extract', clearly identifying the product with species specificity and diagnostic intent. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and the exact code is SCTID 411958002. The inventory context does not alter the concept and avoids procedural or dosing details. A parent concept omitting species would be less accurate, while siblings for other species or therapeutic extracts would be incorrect. The entry remains focused on the product identity."
217853002,Accidentally stepped on during rugby game (event),Accidental stepped-on at a rugby game,"This succinct entry expresses being accidentally stepped on at a rugby game, an Event that maps to SCTID 217853002. It retains accidental intent and the rugby game setting without adding injury or anatomical details. Parent concepts lacking the rugby qualifier or siblings with other sports/training contexts are less appropriate. The preposition 'at' is equivalent to 'during' for event context and maintains coding precision."
698589003,History of Damus-Stansel-Kaye operation (situation),Status post Damus–Stansel–Kaye procedure.,"“Status post” unambiguously indicates the procedure occurred in the past and the patient is presently in the post-procedure state, which aligns with a history-of context rather than an active intervention. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 698589003 (History of Damus-Stansel-Kaye operation) is the most precise fit. The procedure concept itself would be inappropriate because no current performance is implied. More general historical concepts would be less specific. The phrase ""procedure"" is a direct synonym of ""operation"" for DSK, without added attributes."
12399091000119108,Adult abuse (event),Adult abuse noted in ED triage,"This documents recognition of an adult abuse event at ED triage, without specifying type or perpetrator. The main concept is adult abuse event. SNOMED CT category: Event; matches Adult abuse (event) SCTID 12399091000119108. Triage context is administrative and does not alter the clinical concept. It remains distinct from broader Abuse (event) and from child/sibling concepts (domestic violence, physical/sexual abuse, or victim finding)."
259038000,per week (qualifier value),follow-up planned per week,"This entry uses context (“follow-up planned”) but the core qualifier conveyed is “per week,” indicating that the frequency is denominated weekly without stating a count. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The precise match is per week (qualifier value), SCTID 259038000. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings like “weekly” imply recurrence rather than a denominator unit; “per day” or “per month” would be incorrect units. The context does not introduce new attributes affecting code selection; the qualifier remains per week."
82017002,5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate delta-isomerase (substance),5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate delta-isomerase (enzyme),"The parenthetical term '(enzyme)' is a class descriptor that does not change the identity of the substance. The core concept remains the enzyme 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate delta-isomerase. No attributes such as recombinant form, organism source, or clinical deficiency are present. This maps to the SNOMED CT Substance concept SCTID 82017002, whereas parent terms are too broad and no child/sibling distinctions are indicated."
103222001,Coagulum retraction (observable entity),Blood coagulum retraction,"This entry clarifies that the coagulum is a blood clot and denotes its retraction as the observable property. It is an Observable entity and corresponds to SCTID 103222001. The wording does not introduce values, timing, or causal mechanisms, so more specific child concepts are excluded. It also avoids any indication of a procedure, keeping it distinct from sibling test codes. The synonymic phrasing remains clinically equivalent."
115945009,Genus Ornithobacterium (organism),Microbiology organism: Ornithobacterium spp. (genus),"In a microbiology context, 'spp.' explicitly indicates genus-level identification without species resolution. The category is Organism, and the appropriate code is Genus Ornithobacterium (115945009). The entry does not introduce detection status or clinical relationships. Mapping to parent bacterial concepts would lose the genus specification, and mapping to species-level children would be unjustified."
277960005,Structure of Couinaud hepatic segment VI (body structure),Liver segment 6 (Couinaud),"Using Arabic numeral ‘6’ while specifying the Couinaud system denotes the same anatomical entity as segment VI. This Body structure maps to SCTID 277960005. Choosing any parent or unspecified hepatic segment would be less precise, and other numbered segments are siblings. No additional attributes are introduced by the wording."
768447004,Product containing cobalt radioisotope (product),Cobalt radioisotope medicinal product,"The term explicitly indicates a medicinal product with a cobalt radioisotope as the radioactive ingredient. Category: Product. SCTID 768447004 best matches because it is the generic medicinal product class containing a cobalt radioisotope. More general parents (e.g., ‘radiopharmaceutical, unspecified ingredient’) are not as precise, and children naming a specific isotope or strength would be more detailed than stated. The synonym ‘medicinal product’ is clinically standard and does not change the intended code."
74812000,"Railway car, device (physical object)",Described object: train car,"The described object is a 'train car', which is synonymous with a railway car and excludes locomotives. Category: Physical object (Device). There are no additional qualifiers that would map to a passenger or freight subtype. Hence, neither parent nor child concepts fit better than SNOMED CT 74812000."
65484006,Product containing prostacyclin PGI2 (product),Continue the PGI2 prostacyclin drug product,"The continuation statement identifies a drug product with PGI2 (prostacyclin). This fits the SNOMED CT Product hierarchy and matches SCTID 65484006 due to explicit PGI2 designation. It does not suggest any particular dosage form, brand, or salt, which would necessitate a child concept, and remains more specific than generic prostaglandin product parents. The synonymic phrasing does not change the intended concept."
102437006,"Exposure to chemical pollution, non-occupational (event)",Non-work-related chemical pollution exposure,"The concept conveyed is an exposure event to chemical pollution that is not related to employment. That matches the Event 'Exposure to chemical pollution, non-occupational' (SCTID 102437006). Using 'non-work-related' is a clinically equivalent synonym for non-occupational and does not add new attributes. It avoids mapping to occupational exposure and does not specify medium, severity, or causative chemical."
312318005,Ockelbo virus (organism),Referenced organism: Ockelbo virus,"The entry refers to the organism Ockelbo virus without implying presence in a specimen, infection, or any additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It corresponds exactly to 312318005 Ockelbo virus (organism), since the text names the discrete virus. Selecting a parent concept like Virus (organism) sacrifices specificity, and choosing related concepts such as Ockelbo disease (disorder) or Sindbis virus (organism) would introduce different meanings. “Referenced organism” is contextual phrasing and maintains equivalence to the organism concept."
1344906007,No disorder of peripheral nerves due to diabetes mellitus (situation),Assessment: diabetic peripheral neuropathy absent.,"This assessment-line entry states a negative finding for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which is a peripheral nerve disorder due to diabetes. It is a Situation with explicit context. The code 1344906007 most accurately represents this absence. Using a parent/sibling concept that denotes the presence of neuropathy or specifies a variant would be inaccurate due to the negation and lack of subtype detail. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term’s negated context and remains uniquely codable to this concept."
409545004,Hot zone (environment),Hot zone,"The entry explicitly names the environmental classification 'hot zone' without adding any further attributes. The main concept is a designated area type, not a clinical condition. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The preferred term and SCTID 409545004 are the most precise match because the wording exactly corresponds to the defined environment concept. Broader parents like 'Environment' are less specific, and siblings such as 'Warm zone (environment)' or 'Cold zone (environment)' are not applicable. No paraphrase is used, so the code selection remains unchanged."
385507005,Mycobacterium mageritense (organism),"Non-tuberculous mycobacterium, Mycobacterium mageritense","The entry classifies the organism as a non-tuberculous mycobacterium and names the species Mycobacterium mageritense. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The phrase is a taxonomic descriptor consistent with the species and does not introduce clinical attributes; therefore, SCTID 385507005 is the best fit. The parent concept 'Nontuberculous mycobacteria (organism)' would be less specific, and no other species is indicated, avoiding sibling mapping. No strain-level information implies no child concept."
216399004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, dance hall (environment)",Accident took place at a dance hall,"This statement identifies the dance hall as the environment where the accident happened, which corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 216399004. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. No additional attributes such as type of accident, time, or outcomes are introduced, keeping the focus solely on place. Parent concepts are too general, and terms like nightclub or concert venue would be sibling concepts that do not match the specified dance hall. The wording is a straightforward paraphrase fully equivalent to the preferred term."
704663000,Parasitic worm specimen (specimen),Clinical note: parasitic worm specimen,"In clinical documentation, this phrase identifies the specimen as a parasitic worm, with no additional details such as subtype or source. It aligns with the SNOMED CT Specimen category and precisely maps to Parasitic worm specimen (specimen), SCTID 704663000. A parent concept like 'Parasite specimen' would be broader, and children specifying particular helminths would be too narrow based on the available information."
55127008,Trigeminal nerve sensory function (observable entity),Preoperative assessment item: trigeminal nerve sensory function,"The phrase indicates that the sensory function of the trigeminal nerve is part of a preoperative assessment, specifying the observable. No abnormality or normality is claimed. The accurate SNOMED CT code is 55127008. Parent concepts such as unspecified cranial nerve sensory function or overall trigeminal function (including motor) are less precise, and branch-level sensory function siblings are not invoked."
224057009,Idaho (geographic location),Idaho (geographic location),"Including the semantic tag '(geographic location)' explicitly affirms the entry refers to the place rather than any other usage of the word. No attributes such as residence or travel are added. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This aligns exactly with 224057009. Parent concepts (country-level) or child concepts (cities, counties within Idaho) are less specific or overly granular compared with the intended state-level location."
45404002,Inkoo virus (organism),Organism: Inkoo virus,"The entry explicitly labels the concept as an organism and names Inkoo virus, keeping the focus on the taxon rather than any clinical state. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The appropriate code is Inkoo virus (SCTID 45404002), since no diagnostic, procedural, or disorder-related attributes are expressed. General parents like Virus (organism) are insufficiently specific, while child or sibling organisms are not referenced. The phrasing avoids detection or infection semantics."
443411000124108,Elemental formula (product),Elemental formula continued,"This follow-up phrasing retains the focus on the elemental formula as a product, with 'continued' indicating context but not altering the product’s identity. It maps to the Product category and specifically Elemental formula (product), SCTID 443411000124108. The entry refrains from adding brand, age, route, or composition modifiers beyond 'elemental,' avoiding child concepts and exceeding the specificity of parent nutrition products. It does not match sibling products such as semi-elemental or polymeric formulas."
736234007,Pediatric community care plan (record artifact),Intake form indicates: pediatric community care plan,"This entry places the pediatric community care plan in the intake documentation context but still identifies the same plan artifact. The concept is a recorded care plan for community-based pediatric services. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The specific code Pediatric community care plan (record artifact) fits best; generic intake items or non-pediatric community plans would be less precise. The intake form context is documentation metadata, not an attribute of the plan’s content."
789312007,Mirrored photographic image of teeth corrected flipped vertically and horizontally (record artifact),Image orientation correction: mirrored tooth photo fixed by flipping vertically and horizontally.,The entry highlights orientation correction for a mirrored photographic image of the teeth using both vertical and horizontal flips. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It precisely corresponds to the concept and excludes parent or sibling alternatives that lack dual-axis correction or specify different scenarios. The synonyms used keep the modality and subject intact without changing the code selection.
427689006,Percent sodium chloride (qualifier value),% sodium chloride,"This entry uses the percent symbol with sodium chloride to denote the concentration unit. It conveys the same qualifier value: concentration expressed in percent specific to sodium chloride. Category: Qualifier value. No numeric amount, formulation, or method (e.g., w/v) is specified, keeping it aligned to SCTID 427689006. A general “%” would map to a broader parent, and a measurable concept like “percentage of sodium chloride in sample” would be an observable entity. Product concepts such as “normal saline” would be incorrect because the entry does not imply a product or a specific strength. Thus, this is a precise, semantically equivalent representation."
258555003,Hot stool specimen (specimen),Patient provided a hot stool specimen,"This statement indicates patient provision of a specimen described as hot stool. It is clearly a Specimen concept and maps to SCTID 258555003. The context of patient provision is workflow-related and does not add attributes that would necessitate a different concept. Generic fecal or stool specimen codes are too broad because they lack the ‘hot’ qualifier. Thus, the hot stool specimen code is the most precise match."
77887007,Notched (qualifier value),Edge noted as notched,"This entry relays an observation of an edge being “notched,” absent any additional clinical specifics. Within SNOMED CT, the category is Qualifier value, and Notched (77887007) is the most specific match. Parent concepts covering general edge/shape descriptors would be less detailed, and sibling descriptors like “serrated” or “smooth” are different attributes. The content adds no extra features such as site or severity, supporting the qualifier value selection."
223643002,East European country (geographic location),East European country,"The main concept is a country situated within Eastern Europe. No additional attributes (e.g., specific nation, time, or purpose) are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This exactly matches SCTID 223643002, which defines the class of countries in Eastern Europe. The parent concept 'European country' would be too broad, and the sibling 'Eastern Europe (region)' would be incorrect because the entry specifies a country-level location rather than a region. The phrasing is direct and unambiguous for the concept."
372450004,Endocervical route (qualifier value),Documentation: endocervical route,"This entry records the endocervical route in documentation, focusing solely on the route of administration. SNOMED category: Qualifier value. The exact match is SNOMED CT 372450004, not a general route-of-administration parent category or a different anatomical route. The documentation context does not add clinical attributes and remains a semantically equivalent expression of the same qualifier."
721912009,Medication summary document (record artifact),Medications summary,"The plural 'Medications summary' still names a summary artifact focused on medications, which corresponds to 'Medication summary document (record artifact)' in the Record artifact hierarchy. It does not add timing, source, or clinical process information, so it avoids mapping to siblings like reconciliation or administration records. It is more specific than a parent 'clinical summary' because it is medication-focused. The synonym maintains equivalence and coding precision."
1155871002,Presence of direct invasion by primary malignant neoplasm of oral mucosa to nerve (observable entity),Imaging demonstrates the primary oral mucosal malignancy directly invades a nerve.,"This documentation affirms the presence of direct nerve invasion by the primary oral mucosal cancer based on imaging, mapping to SCTID 1155871002 (Observable entity: presence of direct invasion to nerve). No additional attributes are introduced, and the wording is not better assigned to a sibling concept like bone invasion or perineural spread. Using “directly invades a nerve” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase for direct invasion to nerve."
787612006,Photographic image extraoral with 45 degree view (record artifact),"Photographic image (extraoral, 45° view)","This entry explicitly states a photographic image that is extraoral with a 45° view, aligning exactly with SNOMED CT 787612006 (Record artifact). By including both extraoral and the 45° view, it narrows to the intended concept rather than broader parents like generic extraoral images without view details. It excludes sibling options such as frontal or profile views. The term “photographic image” is the formal expression of “photo,” and the attributes are unchanged."
247022005,Pupil movement (observable entity),Pupillary movement,"This uses the clinically equivalent synonym 'pupillary' for 'pupil,' expressing the same observable—movement of the pupil—without adding any findings or stimuli. The concept is an Observable entity, and SNOMED CT 247022005 precisely represents the parameter of pupil movement. It does not specify reflex testing, dilation, constriction, or normal/abnormal results, so child/sibling concepts like pupillary light reflex or pupil constriction are less suitable. The wording remains focused on the observable trait, not a procedure or outcome."
20078004,Substance abuse treatment center (environment),Center for substance abuse treatment,"This is a direct paraphrase that still names the environment: a center dedicated to substance abuse treatment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (environment), and SCTID 20078004 matches exactly. The synonym 'center for substance abuse treatment' is clinically equivalent to ‘substance abuse treatment center’ and does not imply any additional attributes or differing facility types. More general parents or different siblings (clinic, detox unit, alcohol-only center) would deviate from the specified center concept. No timing, severity, or service details are added. Therefore, the precise code selection is 20078004."
3138006,Bone (tissue) structure (body structure),Anatomy noted: osseous tissue,"The entry records the anatomical element as 'osseous tissue,' a synonym for bone tissue, without any added attributes. Category: Body structure. SCTID 3138006 is most precise for bone tissue. Parent classes are overly broad; no specific subtypes (children) are referenced. Sibling tissues are not indicated because the term 'osseous' denotes bone specifically."
227350006,Lentils (substance),Ingredient inventory entry: lentils,"This indicates lentils as an inventory ingredient entry but does not introduce attributes such as processing, timing, or variety; it still denotes the substance lentils. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The correct mapping is Lentils (substance) SCTID 227350006. Parent or sibling legume concepts would be less precise, and no child forms (e.g., lentil flour) are implied. The inventory context is neutral and does not change code selection."
411678007,Dactylopius coccus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract of Dactylopius coccus,"This phrase identifies a diagnostic allergen extract and specifies the source organism Dactylopius coccus. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The wording is a direct paraphrase of the FSN and maintains the diagnostic and source elements required for SCTID 411678007. It does not imply therapeutic immunotherapy or add dose form or administration details. A parent concept like “diagnostic allergen extract” would be less specific, and a sibling such as a different species’ extract would not match the source named here."
217300003,Jump from burning camping place (event),Patient report: jumped from a flaming campground,"This documents an event where a jump occurred from a campground that was flaming, equivalent to burning. Core concepts: jump; flaming campground (camping place). Category: Event. “Flaming” preserves the burning state, and “campground” is a valid synonym for camping place. Parent concepts that are broader or omit the location/state and sibling concepts for other origin points are less appropriate, making SCTID 217300003 the best fit."
411568003,Budgerigar feathers diagnostic allergen extract (product),Budgerigar feather allergen extract for diagnostic testing,"This statement names the budgerigar feather allergen extract and confines its use to diagnostic testing, reinforcing it as a testing product. The main concept is the diagnostic allergen extract product derived from budgerigar feathers. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 411568003 is the most accurate code. A parent concept omitting species or material would be less precise, while siblings like therapeutic allergen extracts or non-feather budgerigar materials (e.g., down/dander) would not fit. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent without adding extra attributes beyond diagnostic intent."
414237002,Feature of entity (observable entity),Observed feature of entity,"The entry denotes that the feature is observed, but this is contextual and does not change the underlying concept: an observable feature of an unspecified entity, with no subtype detail. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It maps to 414237002 Feature of entity (observable entity) because the core concept is the generic feature. Selecting a procedure (assessment) or a finding of presence would be incorrect, as no evaluation action or presence/absence state is specified. Child feature types would add specificity not supported by the text."
1217205000,Selumetinib sulfate (substance),Selumetinib sulfate compound,"The entry denotes the compound selumetinib sulfate, a chemical entity categorized as a Substance in SNOMED CT. The term 'compound' is a neutral synonym that still refers to the substance and does not imply a medicinal product or administration. This is more exact than selumetinib base and avoids misclassification to product concepts by excluding dose, brand, or formulation details."
779008341000119108,History of fracture of ethmoid bone (situation),History of ethmoidal bone fracture,"This entry uses the synonym “ethmoidal bone” to indicate a past fracture, precisely matching the Situation with explicit context concept for history of ethmoid bone fracture. It neither implies current injury nor adds attributes beyond the historical context. Parent or sibling concepts for other bones or more general fracture histories are less precise, and the active disorder form would miscode the status. “Ethmoidal” is a recognized synonym that does not change code selection."
297463006,Vietnamese language (qualifier value),Tiếng Việt,"Tiếng Việt is the autonym for the Vietnamese language and is a clinically equivalent synonym for Vietnamese language. The concept category is Qualifier value. Using the native name does not change the semantics—it still denotes the standard Vietnamese language covered by 297463006. It does not imply dialectal variants (e.g., Northern or Southern Vietnamese) or different modalities (e.g., sign language). Therefore, parent, child, or sibling concepts are less precise than this specific language value."
732180002,Entire non-coronary non-aorta systemic artery (body structure),Whole systemic artery other than the aorta or coronary artery,"“Whole” is a synonym for “entire,” and the entry specifies a systemic artery that is not the aorta or a coronary artery. This is an anatomical Body structure. SCTID 732180002 fits exactly, describing the complete non-coronary, non-aortic systemic artery. The broader parent concept would include the aorta/coronaries, and specific named arteries would be children. Sibling concepts like “coronary artery” or “aorta” are explicitly excluded, ensuring accurate mapping. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and maintains the intended scope."
86801005,"Gestation period, 6 weeks (finding)",At 6 weeks of gestation.,"The entry expresses that the pregnancy is at six weeks of gestation, which is a specific clinical finding. It corresponds to Gestation period, 6 weeks (finding) SCTID 86801005. This wording does not add method, source, or other modifiers, making parent concepts too vague and sibling concepts with other week counts incorrect. The phrasing is a clear paraphrase of the same concept."
82882003,Eupatorium perfoliatum (organism),Botanical specimen: Eupatorium perfoliatum,"The entry refers to a specimen that is Eupatorium perfoliatum, specifying the organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 82882003 fits as it represents the species. The mention of 'specimen' is contextual and does not shift the concept to a procedure or finding. Parent genus-level concepts are less specific, and sibling species are not indicated; therefore, the species code is the correct choice."
43848004,Ancrod (substance),Chart lists ancrod,"This documentation statement simply records the presence of the term 'ancrod' on the chart, pointing to the substance by name without indicating product form or administration. The main concept is ancrod. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The most specific match is Ancrod (substance) SCTID 43848004. Parent categories (e.g., 'protease') lack the named specificity, and sibling product or procedural concepts are not suggested by the wording."
182521000,Bronchus catheterized (situation),Bronchus is catheterized,"Main concept: bronchus catheterized, expressed as a status statement. No additional details are introduced (no laterality, timing, purpose, or method). SNOMED CT category: Situation. The use of 'is' frames this as a current status rather than a procedure event, matching SCTID 182521000. A procedure concept for bronchial catheterization would be less appropriate because the entry does not document the act of performing the procedure. Parent or sibling concepts are excluded by the specific site 'bronchus' and the situational phrasing."
1365803002,Photographic intraoral direct image of frontal view of teeth with mouth open (record artifact),"Direct intraoral photograph of teeth, frontal view, open mouth","The text identifies a direct intraoral photograph, focuses on the frontal view of teeth, and notes the mouth is open, characterizing a Record artifact. These features match SNOMED CT’s Photographic intraoral direct image of frontal view of teeth with mouth open. Using a parent concept lacking the view/mouth-open qualifiers would be overly generic, while siblings that differ by view, mouth position, or imaging setting/modality would miscode. The synonyms (“open mouth” vs. “mouth open”) and slight rephrasing maintain attribute equivalence and do not change code selection."
34148009,Structure of frenulum labii inferioris (body structure),Lower lip frenum,"The entry labels the anatomical fold connecting the lower lip (labial) as a Body structure, i.e., the lower labial frenulum, which aligns directly with SCTID 34148009. It contains no added attributes. Choosing a parent concept like ‘lip structure’ would be too broad, and siblings (upper lip frenum, lingual frenum) are incorrect. This synonym is clinically equivalent and maintains precise anatomical specificity."
1363554006,Past pregnancy history of disorder of puerperium (situation),Obstetric summary: history of puerperal complication.,"This summarizes that the obstetric history includes a puerperal complication, which is clinically synonymous with a disorder of the puerperium. It is explicitly historical, thus a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 1363554006 is the most precise match because the wording focuses on past pregnancy history in the postpartum period. Specific child concepts (e.g., postpartum infection) are not stated; broader or different-period obstetric histories would be less appropriate. 'Complication' here is a clinically safe synonym for 'disorder' in this context."
29744007,Macrozamia spiralis (organism),The species is Macrozamia spiralis,"This sentence asserts the species identity as Macrozamia spiralis, which corresponds to a specific organism entity. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It avoids introducing any clinical or situational details and remains purely an identification of the organism. Parent (genus/family) or sibling species are not indicated. The most precise code is Macrozamia spiralis (SCTID 29744007)."
16215171000119102,Specimen from abscess of Bartholin gland (specimen),Specimen from Bartholin gland abscess,"The entry explicitly describes a specimen derived from an abscess located in the Bartholin gland. The main concept is a specimen and its source site. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 16215171000119102 is the most precise match because it encodes a specimen taken from a Bartholin gland abscess without implying method, laterality, or other attributes. Broader parent concepts like “Specimen from abscess” or “Specimen from Bartholin gland” are less specific, and child or sibling concepts that would specify method (e.g., swab/aspirate) or laterality are not supported by the wording."
272537004,Standing in water facing side (finding),Standing in water with side-facing orientation,"This phrase expresses the required posture (standing), context (in water), and orientation (side-facing). It is a Clinical finding and directly aligns with Standing in water facing side (SCTID 272537004). Broader parents fail to capture orientation, and siblings that change orientation or posture would be inaccurate. The wording adds no timing, severity, laterality, or cause."
711240007,Antigen of Acremonium chrysogenum protein (substance),Listed substance: Antigen of Acremonium chrysogenum protein,"The line lists a substance and names it exactly as the antigen of the Acremonium chrysogenum protein. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 711240007 fits this wording. Choosing a parent concept (antigen of the organism without protein detail) would be too broad, while selecting the protein substance itself or an allergen-specific sibling would inaccurately change the meaning."
736991005,Planned contraception method (observable entity),Follow-up: planned contraceptive method confirmed,"The follow-up note indicates confirmation of the planned contraceptive method, retaining the observable focus on a planned method and not specifying which method. It remains an Observable entity. SCTID 736991005 is the most precise match. General contraception method concepts without planning or child concepts naming particular methods do not align with this wording."
773432009,Obstetric postnatal care plan (record artifact),Postpartum obstetric plan of care,"This phrase uses 'postpartum' and 'plan of care' to denote the same record artifact as an obstetric postnatal care plan. The main concepts are postpartum timing and obstetric context, and the artifact nature (plan of care). The SNOMED category is Record artifact. It is more specific than a general 'plan of care' and avoids sibling concepts such as antenatal or general maternal care plans. It does not introduce extra attributes like interventions, discharge status, or neonatal care. 'Postpartum' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'postnatal' and does not change the code selection, supporting the exact match to 773432009."
258517008,Shaft of penis swab (specimen),Telehealth note: patient states a swab was done on the shaft of his penis,"Even in patient-reported telehealth context, the statement clearly identifies a swab specimen and the exact anatomical location—the shaft of the penis. This is a Specimen concept best represented by 258517008 Shaft of penis swab (specimen). Parent terms lacking shaft specificity and sibling terms targeting glans or urethra are excluded by the wording. The phrasing is a lay synonym and does not introduce additional attributes beyond site and specimen type."
275128000,Family history: Gastric ulcer (situation),Stomach ulcer noted in family history,"The documentation notes a stomach ulcer within the family history, setting the situational context away from the patient. Stomach ulcer is synonymous with gastric ulcer. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, mapped to Family history: Gastric ulcer (situation), SCTID 275128000. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts like family history of duodenal ulcer are not appropriate because the location is specifically stomach. No extra attributes are indicated."
223502009,Europe (geographic location),Europe (as the continent).,"This notation clarifies Europe’s type as a continent, maintaining the pure geographic concept. The category is Geographic location, mapping precisely to Europe (geographic location) [223502009]. No added clinical attributes are present. Parent concepts like Continent are under-specified, while children or siblings (e.g., Northern Europe, Asia) are inconsistent with the phrasing. The synonym leaves code selection unchanged."
1287996005,Rock avalanche (event),Rock avalanche referenced in HPI.,"Mentioning the rock avalanche in the history of present illness is a contextual placement and does not introduce new attributes beyond the event itself. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The concept is specifically a rock avalanche, not a general avalanche or another landslide subtype. Thus the exact match is Rock avalanche (event), SCTID 1287996005."
1306648002,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Photographic extraoral image of the left half of face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation.,"This entry mirrors the preferred term, specifying a photographic extraoral image of the left half of the face with relaxed lips and jaws in centric relation, matching SCTID 1306648002. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It is the most precise match due to inclusion of left-sided coverage and the exact lip/jaw positions, unlike broader parent artifacts. Sibling concepts (e.g., right hemiface, full-face, or different mouth positions) are not implied. The phrasing introduces no additional attributes."
280584004,Entire lateral check ligament of eye (body structure),Lateral check ligament—eye,"Main concept: the lateral check ligament of the eye. Attributes: none. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The em dash formatting does not alter the target structure; this remains a precise synonym for SCTID 280584004. It excludes broader parents like 'eye ligament' and the medial counterpart sibling, and it does not introduce laterality or partiality that would better fit child concepts."
697161010000103,Immunoglobulin E antibody to Aspergillus nidulans (substance),Aspergillus nidulans IgE,"This short phrase denotes an IgE antibody specific to Aspergillus nidulans. It provides the immunoglobulin class and target species without implying clinical results or procedures, fitting the SNOMED CT Substance category. The best match is Immunoglobulin E antibody to Aspergillus nidulans (substance). Parent concepts like IgE to Aspergillus genus are too general, and siblings referring to other species (e.g., A. fumigatus) or other immunoglobulin classes would be incorrect. The concise synonym retains identical semantics."
223510005,Algeria (geographic location),Locale: Algeria,"“Locale” here is used as a general label for a place, with the value “Algeria” identifying the sovereign country; no extra attributes are specified. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The precise match is Algeria (geographic location) SCTID 223510005, not a broader geographic category or a narrower locality. Child concepts (cities or provinces) and sibling concepts (other countries) are not suggested. The label does not alter the concept being coded."
78353005,Revision of distal catheter in shunt system (procedure),Intraoperative documentation: shunt distal catheter revision carried out,"This intraoperative note indicates that a revision of the distal catheter within a shunt system was carried out, which corresponds directly to the SNOMED CT Procedure Revision of distal catheter in shunt system. The main concept is a procedure placed on the distal catheter and is clearly limited to that component. No added attributes such as shunt subtype or reasons are given. A parent 'shunt revision' code is too broad, and sibling codes for other shunt parts (e.g., proximal catheter, valve) would not fit. The wording is a context-specific synonym preserving the same code selection."
258531008,Wound swab (specimen),Swab of wound (specimen),"The phrase indicates a swab collected from a wound as a specimen, which is semantically equivalent to Wound swab (specimen), SCTID 258531008. It clearly falls under the Specimen category and refrains from adding attributes (e.g., surgical, burn, or diabetic wound). The parent 'swab specimen' is overly general, while 'wound tissue' or 'wound exudate' would be different specimen types (siblings). The parenthetical clarification reinforces the specimen nature without changing code selection."
256393002,Red cells - thawed and washed - cytomegalovirus testing negative (product),Patient notes the red cells were thawed and washed and CMV testing negative,"The patient-reported context still describes the product’s attributes: red cells that underwent thawing and washing and tested CMV negative. This belongs to the SNOMED CT Product category. SCTID 256393002 is the precise concept because it requires all three attributes. Parent concepts like generic RBC products or thawed/washed without CMV status are less specific, and sibling concepts such as CMV-negative RBCs without processing details do not match. The phrasing uses synonyms (‘red cells,’ ‘CMV testing negative’) that are clinically equivalent without altering the intended code."
418018006,Dermatologic surgery (qualifier value),Service: dermatologic surgery,"This indicates the surgical service line is dermatologic, functioning as a specialty qualifier. No procedure specifics, body sites, or temporal aspects are stated. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. Dermatologic surgery (qualifier value) matches best. A parent concept like surgical service (unspecified specialty) is too general, and sibling specialties would not fit. Procedure concepts would add unintended specificity."
395742005,Indium (111-In) chloride (substance),Material name: Indium (111-In) chloride,"The entry provides the material name using the preferred term, indicating indium-111 chloride. Category: Substance. It maps exactly to Indium (111-In) chloride and not to broader isotope-only or different indium compounds. The context 'Material name' adds no clinical attributes, preserving the specificity of the substance concept."
429551001,Mild to moderate risk of (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value),Assigned risk status: mild to moderate,"This entry indicates the assigned status of risk as mild to moderate. The main concept is the contextual risk degree. Category: Qualifier value. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 429551001 since the assigned status is specifically the mild-to-moderate range. Parent “risk status” without degree is insufficiently specific, and sibling statuses for single degrees differ. The “assigned” wording is contextual and does not alter the qualifier’s content."
309275006,Cystectomy specimen (specimen),Gross description: cystectomy specimen,"This is a pathology gross description header identifying the specimen as a cystectomy specimen. The concept is the specimen type; no additional attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The precise mapping is to 309275006, as it exactly denotes a cystectomy specimen and avoids general parents or more specific child concepts."
6601000146108,Sphingobium olei (organism),Chart lists the organism as Sphingobium olei,"The entry identifies Sphingobium olei as the organism in documentation, aligning with the Organism category. The most precise match is Sphingobium olei (SCTID: 6601000146108). No additional findings or context are introduced, so parent (genus) or sibling species concepts would not fit better than the species-level concept."
55948006,Free-standing family medicine clinic (environment),Location of service: freestanding family practice clinic,"The entry denotes the service location and specifies both the standalone/free-standing status and the family practice specialization (clinically equivalent to family medicine). The main concept is environmental/setting. This matches SNOMED CT Free-standing family medicine clinic (environment) SCTID 55948006. It is more precise than the parent that lacks the free-standing detail, and it does not drift into sibling specialties. The synonyms used maintain the exact intended meaning without adding extra attributes."
736797002,Expectation of weight management program (observable entity),Stated expectation of a weight management program,"This entry records that the individual's expressed expectation pertains to a weight management program. It does not add any action such as referral or initiation. SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The code 736797002 maps best because it captures expectation of that specific program. Broader expectation-of-service concepts are less specific, and sibling concepts like planned program or need for program would misrepresent the statement."
463449005,Pneumatic dental scaling system handpiece tip (physical object),Dental air-scaler handpiece tip,"The term 'air-scaler' indicates a pneumatic scaling device, and 'handpiece tip' specifies the tip component used with that device. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This is the most precise match for 463449005 because it identifies both the modality (air) and the part (tip). It is not a broader handpiece concept nor a different technology such as ultrasonic, so parent or sibling mappings would be less accurate."
126262004,"Human platelets, washed (product)",Washed human platelets,"The entry names the blood component product as washed human platelets, explicitly indicating the washing process and human origin. The SNOMED CT category is Product (blood component). This matches SCTID 126262004 because it specifies platelets that have been washed, without adding attributes such as irradiation, leukoreduction, apheresis, pooling, volume, or blood group. The parent concept Human platelets (product) would be less precise because it omits the washing attribute. Sibling concepts that add other processing steps (e.g., irradiated platelets) are not indicated. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not change code selection."
122686008,Specimen from urinary bladder obtained by partial cystectomy (specimen),"Surgical specimen from urinary bladder, partial cystectomy","The entry describes a surgical specimen, identifies the site (urinary bladder), and specifies the procedure used to obtain it (partial cystectomy). This pinpoints a SNOMED CT Specimen entity and aligns with SCTID 122686008. Parent concepts that do not specify the method are less precise, and siblings involving total cystectomy or other acquisition techniques are excluded by the explicit 'partial cystectomy' designation. The inclusion of 'surgical specimen' is consistent with the concept and does not change the coding."
256897009,Saliva (substance),Documented substance: saliva,"The entry explicitly records saliva as a substance, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 256897009 directly corresponds to saliva. It does not reference a specimen, nor any clinical condition. Therefore, parent concepts (general body fluids) or sibling/child concepts (e.g., saliva specimen, parotid saliva) are less appropriate than the specific Saliva (substance) code."
218199001,Overexposure to electrical welding arc (event),Arc welding overexposure event,"This wording explicitly labels the occurrence as an overexposure event tied to arc welding, which aligns with the Event category and SCTID 218199001. It avoids adding outcomes or timing. Choosing a broader event like 'Exposure to arc welding' would be insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts relating to other arc sources or injuries would misrepresent the documented event."
441580000,Federated States of Micronesia (geographic location),Country specified: Federated States of Micronesia,"This entry indicates that the specified entity is a country, and the value is the Federated States of Micronesia. Category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 441580000 is the correct code since the text refers to the country-level location. Parent, child, and sibling concepts would not align with this exact wording. The label does not introduce extraneous attributes; it simply clarifies the entity type."
472959005,History of acute lower respiratory tract infection (situation),PMHx positive for acute lower respiratory tract infection,"PMHx (past medical history) being positive establishes the historical nature of 'acute lower respiratory tract infection.' This situational context maps to History of acute lower respiratory tract infection (SCTID 472959005) in SNOMED CT’s Situation with explicit context hierarchy. Coding to the active disorder would be incorrect. The entry does not specify a subtype (e.g., pneumonia) and is more precise than a general respiratory infection history by indicating the lower tract."
773258006,Product containing isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 inhibitor (product),Medication: IDH1 inhibitor,"The entry identifies a medication with IDH1 inhibitory pharmacologic role, mapping to a product containing an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 inhibitor. SNOMED CT category: Product (medicinal product). It fits SCTID 773258006 because it denotes the role-based product class without naming a particular drug or form. A child concept like “Product containing ivosidenib” is avoided by not specifying the ingredient, and a sibling like IDH2 inhibitor is ruled out by clearly stating IDH1. The abbreviation “IDH1 inhibitor” is a clinically equivalent synonym for isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 inhibitor."
408588000,Service user's alias (observable entity),Other name the service user goes by,"This phrasing indicates an alias—another name used by the service user—without implying it is preferred or legal, making it an Observable entity data item. The wording avoids subtype specificity such as nickname or maiden name, and does not introduce identifiers. Parent concepts covering names generally are too broad; sibling concepts like preferred name or legal name are not supported by the text. Therefore, 'Service user's alias (observable entity)' SCTID 408588000 is the best fit."
448826009,Brief operative note (record artifact),Brief operative note available for review,"This indicates the availability of the brief operative note, maintaining the focus on the document type. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The correct code is Brief operative note (record artifact) SCTID 448826009, as the term explicitly identifies the brief operative note. Availability is a workflow status and does not redirect coding to a parent Operative note or a sibling document type."
309909006,Neurological intensive care unit (environment),Neuro ICU,"This commonly used clinical shorthand refers specifically to the neurological intensive care unit. The concept expressed is the environment: a neuro-focused ICU. Category: Environment or geographical location. Although abbreviated, it is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'Neurological intensive care unit'. It does not introduce attributes beyond the environment type. It is more specific than the parent 'Intensive care unit (environment)' and does not imply sibling environments like 'Neonatal ICU' or 'Cardiac ICU'; therefore SCTID 309909006 is the most precise code."
294841000,Allergy to porcine calcitonin (finding),Avoidance noted: porcine calcitonin allergy,"The entry records avoidance based on a Clinical finding—an allergy to porcine calcitonin. The management context does not change the underlying concept or add severity or timing. The porcine source requires SCTID 294841000 rather than broader or different-source concepts. It does not describe an acute reaction, so a disorder code for reaction is not implied."
350305008,Product containing pethidine analog (product),Drug product that contains a pethidine analog,"This entry identifies a drug product and states it contains a pethidine analog as the active ingredient class. That language aligns with the SNOMED CT medicinal product concept “Product containing pethidine analog (product).” It omits dose form, strength, route, brand, or specific analogue names, keeping the granularity appropriate. Parent classes like opioid-containing product are too broad, while children that name a specific analogue or add formulation details would be too specific. The term contains no extra clinical attributes."
736378000,Medication management plan (record artifact),Medication management plan available in record,"This statement confirms that a medication management plan is present and accessible in the patient’s record, clearly indicating a plan artifact. SNOMED CT concept 736378000 (Record artifact) is the best fit. It does not suggest broader care plans, nor does it describe medication orders, administration logs, or review/reconciliation procedures. The synonymy is exact for the plan artifact, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate."
224033009,Fort Smith region of Northwest Territories (geographic location),"Residence in Fort Smith region, NWT","The context of residence specifies that the geographic location is the Fort Smith region in NWT without changing the identity of the location itself. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (environment or geographical location). SCTID 224033009 matches the region; parent concepts (e.g., 'Northwest Territories') are too broad, and 'Fort Smith (town)' would be incorrect. 'NWT' is a standard abbreviation and preserves equivalence."
84246003,Injection of thyroid (procedure),Surgical record: thyroid gland injection,"This surgical documentation reports an injection performed in the thyroid gland. The main concept is intrathyroid injection. No attributes such as agent, imaging guidance, or lesion are included, preserving the general injection context. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the most precise code is Injection of thyroid (84246003). Parent concepts of general thyroid procedures are too broad. Children that specify substance (e.g., ethanol), technique (e.g., ultrasound-guided), or target lesion add details not present. Sibling concepts like aspiration, biopsy, or systemic medication injection are incorrect because this is injection into the gland itself. The phrasing is an acceptable synonym and maps cleanly to the base concept."
268862000,Maternal prolapsed cord (situation),OB problem list: maternal umbilical cord prolapse,"This entry places umbilical cord prolapse on the mother’s obstetric problem list, clearly setting the maternal subject-of-record without adding other qualifiers. The core concepts are umbilical cord and prolapse; the context is maternal. The SNOMED CT category is Situation, and Maternal prolapsed cord (situation) [268862000] is exact for documenting this maternal condition. The generic disorder concept lacks maternal specification, and any child concepts tied to labor stage or type of prolapse are not referenced. The term ‘umbilical cord prolapse’ is clinically equivalent to ‘prolapsed umbilical cord’ and the maternal framing secures the proper code."
17591005,Etheostoma thalassinum (organism),Species: Etheostoma thalassinum,"By explicitly labeling 'Species' and providing the binomial name, the entry targets the organism at the species level. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This points directly to SCTID 17591005. More general taxa (genus or family) would be too broad, and subspecies or varieties are not indicated, so child concepts are not appropriate. No clinical attributes are introduced."
736690008,Dialysis care plan (record artifact),Dialysis care plan available in record,"The phrase denotes that the dialysis care plan is available within the medical record, clearly an artifact. The correct SNOMED mapping is Dialysis care plan (record artifact). Category: Record artifact. The mention of availability/location does not change the concept or imply a different document type, nor does it specify modality or timing that would shift coding to a child concept."
722448004,Treatment plan report (record artifact),Treatment plan report included,"The phrase confirms inclusion of a treatment plan report, which directly corresponds to SNOMED CT 722448004 (Record artifact). The inclusion context does not modify the artifact type. It is preferable to the parent 'Report' due to specificity and does not better fit sibling artifacts (e.g., 'Treatment plan' or 'Procedure note'). No extra clinical qualifiers are present."
287182007,Attempted suicide by suffocation (event),"Patient report: ""I attempted suicide by suffocation.""","The patient statement clearly expresses an attempted suicide and identifies suffocation as the method, adding no other qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 287182007 is the precise match for attempted suicide by suffocation. Parent concepts without method are too general, and sibling concepts involving other methods would be inaccurate. The quote is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term, ensuring the same coding."
420254004,Body cavity route (qualifier value),Route qualifier—body cavity,"This entry declares the route qualifier as ‘body cavity,’ which maps directly to Body cavity route (qualifier value) SCTID 420254004. The category is Qualifier value since it specifies the route dimension of administration. It is more specific than an undifferentiated route-of-administration qualifier and avoids naming any specific cavity that would require a more granular child code. The paraphrase with ‘route qualifier’ is semantically equivalent and appropriate."
463799008,Ophthalmic diode-pumped solid-state laser system (physical object),Ophthalmic diode-pumped solid-state laser device,"The term 'device' here is a synonym of 'system' within the SNOMED device domain and still points to the ophthalmic diode-pumped solid-state laser apparatus. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). It specifies ophthalmic use and the diode-pumped solid-state technology, which exactly fits SCTID 463799008. More general parent devices ('ophthalmic laser device') or different technology siblings ('ophthalmic diode laser device') are less appropriate, and no brand, wavelength, or medium details are introduced that would force mapping to a child concept."
242208006,Fall from balloon in flight (event),Fell out of balloon midair.,"The phrase indicates a fall ('fell out of') from a balloon and specifies 'midair,' which is synonymous with 'in flight.' The concept is a single external cause event involving a balloon that is airborne. SNOMED CT category: Event. 242208006 is the most precise because it encodes fall from balloon in flight; broader or different vehicle concepts (e.g., glider or general aircraft) are not indicated, and a non‑flight balloon fall would be incorrect. 'Midair' is an equivalent descriptor of the in‑flight status without adding attributes."
46087007,Structure of acromial end of clavicle (body structure),Acromial end of the collarbone,"The concept is the acromial (lateral) end of the clavicle, using 'collarbone' as a lay synonym for 'clavicle.' The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and maps to SCTID 46087007; broader anatomical parents like 'Collarbone/clavicle' alone are less specific, and adjacent structures such as the AC joint are not implied. The entry adds no extra attributes."
860928008,Product containing psyllium and/or psyllium derivative (product),History notes: prior psyllium-containing product use,"This historical documentation indicates past use of a product containing psyllium, aligning to 860928008. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It does not add attributes such as dose form, route, strength, exclusivity, or role, thereby avoiding child or sibling concepts. The focus remains on the product containing the ingredient, not the psyllium substance concept itself."
244293007,Entire deep artery of penis (body structure),Vascular structure: deep artery of penis,"This entry specifies the vascular structure in question as the deep artery of the penis. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The wording narrows to the specific artery rather than a general penile vessel and does not suggest alternative siblings or branches. No laterality or condition is added. Therefore, SCTID 244293007 (Entire deep artery of penis) is the correct code."
90049009,Unexplained sudden death (event),Sudden unexplained death,"This phrase directly names the concept as sudden and unexplained death without adding qualifiers. It is an Event. The best match is Unexplained sudden death (event) 90049009; the wording is essentially identical to the concept’s preferred term. It does not point to narrower entities like sudden cardiac death or SUDEP, nor broader ones like generic death or sudden death lacking cause specification. The synonym preserves the same meaning as the preferred term."
284726007,Egg of class Trematoda (organism),Fluke egg (Trematoda),"This entry uses the common name fluke and explicitly ties it to Trematoda, describing the egg stage without additional attributes. It maps to the Organism concept Egg of class Trematoda (284726007). A parent Trematoda (organism) would lose the egg-stage specificity, while child concepts for species-specific eggs or other stages are not indicated. Sibling taxa (e.g., cestode eggs) are excluded. The parenthetical clarifies the taxonomic class and does not alter the concept."
65445001,Ethyl violet stain (substance),Ethyl violet stain referenced,"This entry identifies Ethyl violet stain as the only medical concept, with ‘referenced’ serving as contextual language. The concept type is Substance, and the best code is Ethyl violet stain (substance), SCTID 65445001. The text does not introduce any attribute like concentration or mixture; therefore, neither parent stain categories nor other violet dyes are correct."
258458004,Fistula fluid specimen (specimen),Fistula fluid sample,"The term ""sample"" is synonymous with ""specimen"" in clinical and lab contexts and indicates fluid obtained from a fistula. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This maps to SCTID 258458004 because it conveys the same specimen type and source. Parent terms like Body fluid specimen are more general, and siblings such as Fistula tissue sample would imply a different material. No cause, site, severity, or timing attributes are added."
412259001,Olmesartan (substance),Chart notation: olmesartan,"The chart notation records the name olmesartan, pointing to the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the correct code is 412259001. No product details, dosing, formulation, or references to olmesartan medoxomil appear, so medicinal product or prodrug concepts do not better fit. Broader parent concepts, such as ARB class, are unnecessary given the specific substance name."
272686009,Maxillary alveolus structure (body structure),Anatomical site: maxillary alveolus,"The wording designates the anatomical site as the maxillary alveolus, which is the alveolar process of the maxilla. The context label ‘Anatomical site’ does not add clinical attributes; it remains a Body structure. The most precise SNOMED CT concept is Maxillary alveolus structure (272686009). Choosing a parent (maxilla) would be overly broad, and selecting a child (e.g., laterality or specific tissue) would add detail not present; mandibular alveolus is a sibling and incorrect."
122558009,Blood specimen from blood product (specimen),Blood sample obtained from a blood product,"This phrasing indicates the specimen is blood and that it was obtained from a blood product, which is the defining attribute. The concept is a Specimen in SNOMED CT, exactly matching 'Blood specimen from blood product' SCTID 122558009. Using 'sample' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'specimen.' Parent concepts like generic blood specimen lack the source specification, and sibling/child concepts that mention component types (e.g., plasma, PRBC) are not implied here."
118104004,Herpes virus culture (procedure),Culture for herpes virus,"This phrasing indicates a culture procedure targeted at herpes virus, without specifying subtype, specimen source, or outcomes. It is a Procedure and aligns with Herpes virus culture (procedure) SCTID 118104004. A parent like general viral culture would not capture the targeted pathogen, and siblings such as PCR or serology are different methods. It avoids child-level detail like HSV-1 culture or VZV culture."
224949008,Throwing self in front of train (finding),Patient threw self in front of a train,"The subject 'patient' provides context but does not alter the finding: the act of throwing oneself in front of a train. This remains a Clinical finding and maps precisely to SNOMED CT 224949008. Coding to broader concepts like 'Suicide attempt' would add intent and outcome not stated, and to other transport-related self-harm would lose the train specificity. The statement contains no extraneous attributes."
1228957006,American Joint Committee on Cancer pT1 (qualifier value),Primary tumor classification pT1 — AJCC,"This wording states that the primary tumor (T) classification under AJCC is pT1, which is the pathologic T1 category. The main concept is AJCC pT1. It falls under the Qualifier value hierarchy. SCTID 1228957006 is appropriate because the entry is specific to AJCC and the pathologic T category at T1, without mentioning substage or site. Using 'primary tumor classification' is a clinically equivalent description of the T component. Parent and sibling concepts (e.g., AJCC pT generic or cT1) are either too broad or not pathologic; children like pT1a would be more specific than stated."
768605007,Product containing purine nucleoside (product),Medication product containing purine nucleoside,"The entry identifies a medication product and indicates that its ingredient includes a purine nucleoside. The correct SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product, and the specific concept is 768605007. No specific purine nucleoside (adenosine, guanosine, etc.) is named, making child concepts too specific. The explicit purine qualifier makes broader nucleoside product parents less appropriate, and it is not a pyrimidine nucleoside sibling. The term focuses on the product itself rather than an action (e.g., administration), ensuring the product code is the best fit."
4221000179107,Ultrasound imaging report (record artifact),Sonographic report,"The adjective “sonographic” refers to ultrasound imaging. Used with “report,” it designates the imaging report artifact. That places it in the Record artifact hierarchy, matching “Ultrasound imaging report (record artifact).” Parent concepts like “Imaging report” lack modality specificity, and siblings for other modalities (CT, MRI) are incorrect. No added attributes (anatomy, status, severity) are present, so no child specialization is warranted."
115641000119100,At increased risk of malignant hyperthermia (finding),Anesthesia screening indicates increased malignant hyperthermia risk.,"This entry provides context that a screening process identified an increased risk of malignant hyperthermia, without stating causation, genetic findings, or prior episodes. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The correct selection is At increased risk of malignant hyperthermia (SCTID 115641000119100). The screening context does not transform the concept into a diagnostic disorder or a generic risk; it remains the specific increased-risk finding. The wording is a synonymous paraphrase of the preferred term."
58538004,Bumped into other person (event),Cause of visit: bumped into another person,"The phrase assigns the cause of the visit to the event of bumping into another person, without specifying injury, intent, time, or location. The central concept is a person-to-person bump; SNOMED CT category is Event. This aligns specifically with SCTID 58538004. Using more general parent categories or siblings like bump into object or person bumping the subject would misrepresent the event, and no more specific child concept is supported by the wording."
465300002,Resectoscope (physical object),Resectoscope device,"This phrasing identifies the physical object as a device and specifically names it 'Resectoscope'. The main concept is a medical device, SNOMED CT category Physical object, and SCTID 465300002 is the most precise code. The word 'device' is a neutral descriptor that does not add attributes; it does not shift the concept to a parent like 'medical device' nor to a sibling like 'cystoscope'. Therefore it remains exactly the resectoscope."
217306009,Jump from burning private garage (event),Reported event: jump from burning private garage,"The phrase documents an event consisting of jumping from a burning private garage. Attributes: jump; private garage; burning. It does not introduce intent, injuries, height, or specific sub-locations. Category: Event. SCTID 217306009 exactly corresponds to this description. Parent concepts like 'Jump from burning building' lack the specificity of 'private garage', and siblings such as 'Jump from burning public garage' or 'Fall from burning private garage' are not consistent with the text. The entry is a direct representation of the concept."
29964007,Tin measurement (procedure),Tin quantification test,"This phrase expresses a laboratory test whose purpose is to quantify tin; 'quantification' is a synonym for measurement. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It maps directly to Tin measurement (29964007) and avoids added attributes like specimen or indication. Parent concepts such as heavy metal quantification are too broad, while child concepts that constrain to serum/plasma/urine would be more specific than stated. It is not best coded as a finding since the entry names the test, not the result."
441419006,Saccharospirillum impatiens (organism),MALDI-TOF identification: Saccharospirillum impatiens,"The method (MALDI-TOF) is a laboratory context, but the coded concept is the organism Saccharospirillum impatiens. Category: Organism. Method details do not change code selection; the precise species-level organism 441419006 is correct. Broader taxonomic parents or infection disorder codes are not indicated by this entry."
216283008,Accident involving logging car (event),Incident involving logging car (accident),This clearly denotes an accident event with a logging car involved; the parenthetical “accident” removes ambiguity from ‘incident.’ The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps to “Accident involving logging car (event)” SCTID 216283008. More generic parent event concepts or sibling accident types involving other vehicles would be less accurate because the entry specifies a logging car.
213914006,"Fall in train, passenger injured (event)",In-train fall with passenger injury,"Main concept: a fall occurring inside a train leading to an injury of the passenger. Attributes: location (in train), role (passenger), outcome (injury). SNOMED CT category: Event. The concise phrasing is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and maps to SCTID 213914006. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings (e.g., falls in other transport modes or falls from trains) do not match the stated environment. No extraneous clinical detail is present."
1193633004,Island in region of Cabo Verde (geographic location),Island within the Cape Verde islands,"The phrase describes a singular island within the group of Cape Verde islands, equivalent to Cabo Verde’s islands. The main concept is a geographic location tied to the Cabo Verde region. This corresponds to SCTID 1193633004, avoiding broader parent mapping to the country or archipelago as a whole and avoiding generic island concepts. No specific island name is introduced. The use of the English exonym “Cape Verde” and “islands” clarifies context while maintaining semantic equivalence to the preferred term without changing the appropriate code."
286165004,Ability to clean toilet (observable entity),Patient-reported ability to clean the toilet,"The context (patient-reported) specifies the source but still names the same observable property, without asserting presence or absence. No additional attributes such as timing, severity, or help requirements are introduced. The category is Observable entity, and the code SCTID 286165004 is the precise match. A parent concept covering broader household cleaning or a child indicating outcome status would not align with this neutral property label."
407202003,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, serotype O86:H34 (organism)",Isolate identified as enteropathogenic E. coli O86:H34,"The entry describes the organism identity as enteropathogenic E. coli O86:H34, focusing on the organism itself. SNOMED CT category: Organism. While 'isolate identified' provides lab context, the coded concept remains the organism with pathotype and serotype, which uniquely matches SCTID 407202003. It does not add attributes like clinical disease or antimicrobial resistance; therefore, parent concepts (e.g., generic EPEC) or sibling serotypes would be less accurate."
1365824007,Photographic intraoral direct right lateral view image in centric occlusion displaying overjet (record artifact),Right lateral intraoral photographic view in centric occlusion demonstrating overjet.,"This concise entry still specifies the modality (photographic), location (intraoral), view (right lateral, direct implied by standard phrasing), occlusion (centric occlusion), and that overjet is demonstrated in the image. It maps to Record artifact SCTID 1365824007. The term ‘demonstrating’ is equivalent to ‘displaying’. Omitting extraneous details prevents drift to parent/sibling artifacts or to an overjet finding concept."
19187004,Caranx lugubris (organism),C. lugubris (Caranx lugubris),"Using the abbreviated genus initial with the full expansion maintains unambiguous identification of the species Caranx lugubris. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The explicit species-level naming constrains coding to SCTID 19187004, excluding parent or sibling organisms. No attributes such as cause, timing, or findings are introduced."
235264001,Balloon dilation of duodenal stricture (procedure),Operative record: balloon dilation of duodenal stricture,"The operative documentation identifies balloon dilation as the technique and duodenal stricture as the target condition. Category: Procedure. SCTID 235264001 is exact for this combination. Using a broader parent (generic dilation or unspecified GI site) would be less precise, and approach-specific children are not supported by the text. No additional attributes (e.g., guidance, segment of duodenum) are present."
223975001,South Glamorgan (geographic location),South Glamorgan (Wales),"The phrase identifies South Glamorgan and situates it in Wales for context, without adding attributes such as residence or event location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The exact concept remains South Glamorgan, aligning to SCTID 223975001. The parent region (Wales) is mentioned but is not the coding target, and no child areas are included. Parent, child, or sibling concepts would be less appropriate because the wording centers solely on the named county, making the specific geographic location the correct selection."
285079000,Boxing ring (environment),Scene identified: boxing ring,"Here, the ‘scene’ is the environmental location, precisely a boxing ring. There are no added qualifiers beyond location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, and the best code is Boxing ring (environment), SCTID 285079000. More general parents (e.g., sporting arena) lack specificity, while siblings (e.g., boxing gym) refer to a different place. The term ‘scene’ serves as documentation context and is a clinically equivalent way to represent the environment."
70547005,Inner city health center (environment),Facility of record: inner-city health centre,"The facility of record is identified as an inner-city health centre, expressing the environment. Category: Environment or geographical location. UK spelling is a harmless synonym for “health center.” The presence of both inner-city and health centre ensures this maps to the exact concept rather than a generic or different facility type."
397448007,Lymphoma involves a single lymph node region (finding),Nodal involvement pattern: single region in lymphoma.,"This entry characterizes the lymphoma nodal involvement pattern as a single region, avoiding site details or staging labels. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 397448007 is the exact match because it represents 'lymphoma involves a single lymph node region.' Parent concepts without the single-region attribute are less precise, while siblings that include multiple regions or extralymphatic sites are inconsistent with the entry. The wording is clinically equivalent."
223763004,Cebu (geographic location),Address locality: Cebu,"Here, Cebu appears as the locality component of an address, with the codable entity being the geographic location itself. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223763004 is the best match because the entry names Cebu and does not specify whether it is city or province, avoiding child/sibling concepts like Cebu City. Broader parents like Philippines are not the target."
433583005,Genus Desulfocella (organism),Recorded organism genus: Desulfocella,"This entry documents the organism genus as Desulfocella, with no species designation or clinical modifiers. It belongs to the Organism hierarchy in SNOMED CT. The most precise code is SCTID 433583005 (Genus Desulfocella (organism)). Parent concepts such as generic bacteria are too broad, and child species would be too specific. The phrasing is a contextual synonym that remains equivalent to the genus concept."
411741001,Ovalbumin diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy diagnostics: ovalbumin allergen extract,"This entry presents the ovalbumin allergen extract within an allergy diagnostics context, which aligns with a diagnostic allergen product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The content maps precisely to SCTID 411741001 because it identifies a diagnostic-use allergen extract with ovalbumin as the allergenic identity. Parent concepts are too general without ovalbumin, and sibling concepts such as therapeutic extracts are incorrect for a diagnostic reagent. The wording is a contextual synonym and does not add attributes like route, dose, or concentration."
773981004,Palliative care plan (record artifact),Palliative care treatment plan,"The entry denotes a documented plan for treatment within the scope of palliative care; in clinical documentation, 'treatment plan' is synonymous with 'care plan' when referring to recorded planning. The main concept is the record artifact of a plan, not the delivery of treatment. The category is Record artifact. SCTID 773981004 is the precise match, as it specifies palliative care planning. Generic treatment plan codes are too broad, and codes for palliative care services would be incorrect because the entry does not describe performance of care. No added attributes are introduced."
3673007,Leadbetter urethral reconstruction (procedure),Leadbetter approach urethral reconstruction,"Using “approach” conveys the named technique (Leadbetter) applied to urethral reconstruction, without adding other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. There is no timing, indication, or anatomical detail beyond the urethra. SCTID 3673007 provides the exact match. Parent concepts like generic urethroplasty would be less specific, and siblings indicating other named approaches would be incorrect. The synonymic phrasing keeps the clinical intent identical to the preferred term."
432441006,Specimen from hydrocele of tunica vaginalis (specimen),Specimen designation: hydrocele of tunica vaginalis,"The text assigns the specimen designation to a hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, mapping to SCTID 432441006. The main concept is a specimen, with the origin explicitly identified. Category: Specimen. This is the precise match because it specifies the lesion and anatomy without further qualifiers. Using a broader parent would lose specificity, and child concepts such as specific fluid or biopsy specimens would be too narrow and not stated. The synonymic phrasing retains equivalence."
224010008,Wake island (geographic location),Arrival location: Wake Island,"The text uses an arrival context to identify Wake Island, but the main concept is the geographic location Wake Island. SNOMED CT categorizes this under Location/Geographic location, with the precise match Wake island (geographic location) [224010008]. Broader parents are too general, and no narrower sublocation or different place is implied. The arrival context is ancillary and doesn’t change the target concept."
223550008,Eswatini (geographic location),Travel entry: Eswatini,"The text indicates Eswatini as a value in a travel-related field but only specifies the place name, not timing or status. The main concept is the geographic location Eswatini. Category: Location—Geographic location. SCTID 223550008 precisely matches the country. Broader parent concepts or sibling countries would be incorrect, and child concepts (cities/regions) are not stated. The context term 'Travel entry:' is metadata and does not add attributes that would change coding."
256371007,Leukocyte apheresis - irradiated (product),Dispensed: irradiated leukocyte apheresis component,"The entry shows a dispensed blood component consisting of leukocytes from apheresis that has been irradiated. It maps to the Product hierarchy (SCTID 256371007). The dispensing context does not transform it into a procedure; the focus remains on the product. Parent concepts without irradiation are incomplete, and sibling products like platelets are excluded by the leukocyte designation."
3718001,Cow's milk (substance),Cow's milk,"The main concept referenced is cow's milk, explicitly identifying milk from the cow species without any processing, fat content, timing, or clinical qualifiers. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance concept, best matched to Cow's milk (substance) SCTID 3718001. Using the preferred term precisely targets the substance itself and avoids broader parents like Milk (substance) or Animal milk, and avoids siblings such as Goat's milk or Human milk. No attributes like raw/pasteurized, skim/whole, allergen status, or product form are introduced, so child or product concepts would be less appropriate."
29053007,Chlorodiethylacetamide (substance),Occupational list item: chlorodiethylacetamide,"Mentioning Chlorodiethylacetamide on an occupational list is a contextual reference to the substance, not an exposure or event. The main concept is the chemical substance, aligning with SNOMED CT 29053007 (Substance). Concepts for exposures, allergies, or products are less suitable because no such attributes are stated."
184232002,Computer record print (record artifact),Computer record print included in discharge materials,"The statement notes inclusion of a computer record print within discharge materials, pointing to the artifact being a printed computer record without asserting any particular content type. The main concept is a printed version of a computer-based record. Category: Record artifact. SNOMED CT 184232002 is the precise match; broader printed artifacts or content-specific report printouts would be less appropriate. The discharge context does not alter the artifact type, so the code remains the same."
730137003,Entire head of biceps brachii (body structure),Palpation target: entire head of biceps brachii,"In exam context, this names the palpation target as the entire head of the biceps brachii, which is the Body structure intended. The wording aligns to SCTID 730137003 because it references the complete head of the muscle without specifying long or short and without adding other attributes. Parent “Head of biceps brachii” is less specific, and children or siblings like long/short head or tendon do not match the phrasing. The context (palpation) does not change code selection."
103221008,Calcium induced coagulation (observable entity),Coagulation response to calcium,"Main concept is the coagulation response to calcium, which is a paraphrase of calcium induced coagulation. Category: Observable entity. This describes the observable property without specifying magnitude, timing, sample type, or normality, thereby keeping it distinct from child observables such as clotting time or rate. It is more specific than parent concepts of coagulation without the calcium qualifier. The synonym does not change meaning and aligns with SCTID 103221008."
110916005,Right lower lobe bronchus cytologic material (specimen),"Source right lower lobe bronchus, cytology specimen","The entry specifies a cytology specimen with source at the right lower lobe bronchus, packing both specimen type and exact anatomical site into a concise phrase. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 110916005 because the cytologic nature and the right lower lobe bronchus location are explicit. Parent concepts lacking laterality/lobe are less precise; sibling terms for alternate bronchial sites would be incorrect. The entry does not introduce collection technique, timing, or diagnoses, thus staying within the bounds of the specimen concept."
264067000,Left lateral wall (qualifier value),Left lateral wall surface,"“Surface” here is a contextual synonym pointing to the wall location; the phrase still denotes the left lateral wall site. It should be coded as a Qualifier value, 264067000. The entry does not introduce an organ or condition, so anatomical structure concepts (e.g., specific organ walls) are not appropriate. More general parent qualifiers lack the left specification, and no finer child qualifier is described."
1142253001,Hypertrophy of muscle of right upper limb (finding),Right upper extremity muscle enlargement,"The entry conveys enlargement of muscle tissue in the right upper extremity; 'enlargement' here is synonymous with hypertrophy when the tissue type (muscle) is explicitly named. This is a Clinical finding best mapped to Hypertrophy of muscle of right upper limb (1142253001). A parent such as muscle hypertrophy without laterality or an upper limb hypertrophy without specifying right side would be too general, and any child focusing on a particular muscle would be overly specific. The synonym 'upper extremity' equals 'upper limb,' and 'enlargement' for muscle context is clinically equivalent to hypertrophy."
29148000,Protolepsis (organism),Genus-level identification: Protolepsis spp.,"This lab-style statement indicates that identification is at the genus level, using 'spp.' to denote unspecified species within Protolepsis. It maps to the SNOMED CT Organism concept Protolepsis (29148000) and avoids implying any specific species (child) or disease state. Parent or sibling taxa are excluded because the genus Protolepsis is directly named."
309546004,Lumpectomy breast specimen (specimen),Specimen received: lumpectomy (breast),"This is an accessioning-style statement confirming receipt of a specimen from a breast lumpectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and Lumpectomy breast specimen (SCTID 309546004) is the precise concept. No extra clinical attributes are present, and the source procedure is lumpectomy rather than biopsy or mastectomy. Parents are too generic, and siblings involving other breast specimen types are not supported by the wording."
444421000124102,Modular energy formula component (product),Order placed: modular energy formula component,"This is documentation context referencing the same product—the energy-focused component of a modular formula—without adding attributes like dose or route. The main concept is a Product, and “Modular energy formula component (product)” (444421000124102) is the precise SNOMED CT match. The mention of an order is contextual and does not alter the product identity. Parent concepts would be too generic, and macronutrient-specific siblings would not fit because only “energy” is asserted. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term in content, simply embedded in an ordering statement."
768441003,Product containing indium and/or indium compound (product),Product comprising indium or an indium compound,"The core concept is a product that includes indium or an indium compound, with no mention of dose, indication, or route. This is in the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category and matches SCTID 768441003 exactly, as the FSN uses the same 'and/or' structure. Choosing a parent concept would lose specificity, while a child naming a specific indium derivative would be narrower than the statement. 'Comprising' is a synonym of 'containing' and preserves semantic equivalence."
726737008,Comment on laboratory result (record artifact),Free-text comment on lab result,"This entry specifies a free-text comment associated with a lab result, clearly identifying a recorded comment and not the result or its interpretation. It is a Record artifact and should be coded to Comment on laboratory result (726737008). Mentioning 'free-text' describes the format of the comment but does not introduce additional clinical attributes or change the concept. Parent concepts are too generic, and sibling concepts such as interpretive statements or corrected values would indicate different artifacts not present in this wording."
16244008,"Immune adherence, function (observable entity)",Immune adherence function,"The entry explicitly names the functional property of immune adherence, which is an observable entity representing the capacity of the immune adherence phenomenon to occur. There are no added attributes such as method, timing, severity, or results. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Immune adherence, function (observable entity) [16244008], because it denotes the specific functional aspect being observed. Broader parent observables like general immune function or complement function would be less specific, and procedure concepts such as an immune adherence test or clinical findings like abnormal immune adherence would introduce different semantic categories. This phrasing directly aligns with the observable entity and avoids mapping to a sibling or child concept."
217617001,Accidents due to prolonged visit at high altitude (event),Accident resulting from extended high-altitude stay,"This wording conveys an accident event attributable to an extended stay at high altitude, which is semantically equivalent to a prolonged visit and fits SCTID 217617001 (Event). The key attributes are accident, extended/prolonged stay, and high altitude. It does not introduce injury type or activity, so child concepts referring to specific injuries or sports are inappropriate. A parent concept for accidents at high altitude without the extended stay qualifier is less specific. 'Extended stay' is a clinically safe synonym for 'prolonged visit,' leaving the code selection unchanged."
411650006,Caraway diagnostic allergen extract (product),Caraway diagnostic allergen reagent,"Referring to this as a “reagent” maintains the diagnostic testing context, with caraway as the source allergen, fitting a Product code. The best match is SNOMED CT 411650006, as it denotes the diagnostic allergen extract of caraway. Parent categories like “Allergen reagent” lack the caraway detail, and siblings for unrelated allergens or therapeutic reagents are not correct. The synonym “reagent” is clinically equivalent to diagnostic allergen extract in testing contexts and does not introduce any additional attributes."
232786005,Shortening operation on tricuspid papillary muscle (procedure),Procedure name: tricuspid papillary muscle shortening,"The entry provides a procedural label indicating shortening of the tricuspid papillary muscle. Category: Procedure. It aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 232786005 because it identifies the action (shortening) and the anatomical target (tricuspid papillary muscle). Parent categories like 'Cardiac valve procedure' are overly broad, and siblings referring to the mitral papillary muscle or chordae tendineae address different structures. The 'Procedure name:' prefix is context-only and does not modify the coded concept."
621000009105,Viral isolate specimen (specimen),Patient was informed the specimen is a viral isolate,"This patient-facing statement conveys that the specimen type is a viral isolate, meaning the specimen comprises an isolated virus. The main concept is the specimen type; no attributes such as specific virus, source, or method are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 621000009105 precisely captures a viral isolate specimen. Broader parents (e.g., viral specimen) could include non-isolated material, and children specifying a particular virus are not warranted by the wording. The patient communication context does not alter the concept."
251087000,Right ventricular infundibulum ventriculoarterial gradient (observable entity),RV outflow infundibulum V-A gradient,"“RV outflow infundibulum” is a common descriptor of the right ventricular infundibular region, and “V-A gradient” is a clinically accepted abbreviation for ventriculoarterial gradient. Category: Observable entity. This maps to SCTID 251087000 because it identifies the exact measurable gradient at the RV infundibulum between ventricle and artery. Using the outflow terminology does not change the concept or add attributes; it avoids broader RVOT gradients that could include valvar or supravalvar sites by specifying infundibulum."
223702006,Commonwealth of Dominica (geographic location),Dominica — sovereign country,"The entry uses the short name ‘Dominica’ and describes it as a sovereign country, which corresponds to SNOMED CT 223702006 (Commonwealth of Dominica) under Geographic location. The descriptor does not introduce patient attributes or events; it simply clarifies the entity type. The parent ‘Country’ would be insufficiently specific, and children or siblings would be incorrect. The synonym does not change the meaning of the target concept and remains uniquely codable to Dominica."
161805006,Past pregnancy history of cesarean section (situation),Past pregnancy history positive for cesarean delivery.,"The entry confirms that within the patient's past pregnancy history, a cesarean delivery occurred, establishing a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 161805006 is optimal because it encodes exactly 'past pregnancy history of cesarean section.' There are no extraneous attributes such as number or indication. A simple 'history of cesarean' concept is less specific to obstetric past history, and the procedure concept would misclassify. 'Cesarean delivery' is clinically equivalent to 'cesarean section,' not affecting code selection."
79741001,Common bile duct structure (body structure),CBD,"The entry uses the standard clinical abbreviation for common bile duct. The sole concept conveyed is the anatomical structure of the common bile duct, with no additional attributes such as pathology, measurements, or segments. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Body structure category and maps to SCTID 79741001. The abbreviation is a clinically equivalent synonym for common bile duct and does not introduce broader or different structures. Parent concepts like bile duct structure are too broad, and sibling ducts (cystic, hepatic) are not intended. Child granularities like distal CBD or CBD wall are not referenced. Thus, CBD codes to Common bile duct structure (body structure)."
170800007,Treatment of obesity stopped (situation),Discontinued management of obesity.,"The statement denotes that management of obesity has been discontinued, which is synonymous with stopping treatment. This is a situation context and most accurately maps to SCTID 170800007. 'Management' is used as a therapeutic synonym and does not imply non-therapeutic administration or care-plan administrative actions. The lack of modality, timing, or cause keeps it aligned with the specific condition-related cessation concept."
223521001,Cameroon (geographic location),Cameroon — country name,"This expresses 'Cameroon' specifically as a country name, with no clinical or temporal attributes appended. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). It aligns directly with Cameroon (geographic location) SCTID 223521001, and does not suggest a parent concept or any child concept within Cameroon."
473432004,Settle culture plate submitted as specimen (specimen),Settle plate sample submitted,"This phrase indicates a submitted sample that is a settle plate, a synonym of settle culture plate, fitting 'Settle culture plate submitted as specimen' SCTID 473432004 (Specimen category). It provides no extra qualifiers like environment or agar type. Using a generic specimen parent would be less precise, and siblings such as contact plates or swabs would be incorrect. 'Sample' is acceptable as a synonym for specimen in this context."
445572001,Report by copy status (record artifact),Report copy status data element,"This entry points to the data element that stores the copy designation status for a report, without providing the element’s value. It fits the record artifact category because it is part of the documentation metadata. The most precise SNOMED CT concept is 'Report by copy status (record artifact),' which directly represents this data element. More general document data elements (parent) lack specificity, and sibling elements concerning different status domains are not appropriate. 'Data element' is a standard synonym for the stored status field, preserving the intended scope."
425146007,Genus Aethia (organism),Genus Aethia (organism),"The main concept is the taxonomic genus Aethia, explicitly stated and confined to organism classification without any clinical qualifiers. In SNOMED CT, this sits in the Organism hierarchy. This wording matches SCTID 425146007 most precisely because it names the genus-level taxon. Parent concepts (e.g., higher taxa such as family Alcidae or class Aves) are too broad, and child concepts (individual Aethia species) would be too specific. No sibling genus is implied. The phrasing does not introduce exposure, disease, or other attributes; it is a pure genus designation."
415328006,Rhizobium undicola (organism),Rhizobium undicola,"The entry states only the scientific species name Rhizobium undicola, which is a taxonomic organism designation. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This maps most precisely to SCTID 415328006 because it identifies the specific organism without adding clinical context, detection status, strain, site, or disease. Broader parents like Rhizobium (genus) or Bacteria would be less specific, and siblings (other Rhizobium species) or child strain-level concepts are not implied. No attributes beyond the organism name are introduced."
431235004,Specimen from trachea obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Specimen: windpipe FNA biopsy,"This entry documents a specimen and uses 'windpipe' (trachea) with 'FNA biopsy' as the collection method. In SNOMED CT, the Specimen class includes SCTID 431235004 for tracheal specimens obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy. The wording does not add unrelated attributes or suggest a procedure report. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
259828006,Antibody to Chlamydophila psittaci biogroup 4 (substance),Laboratory reagent: antibody to Chlamydophila psittaci biogroup 4,"The entry places the antibody in a laboratory reagent context but still identifies the same Substance—an antibody targeting Chlamydophila psittaci biogroup 4. The SNOMED CT category remains Substance, and SCTID 259828006 is appropriate because the target specificity is unchanged and no additional attributes (isotype, label, clonality, results) are added. Mentioning 'laboratory reagent' describes usage, not a different concept type such as a device or procedure. Parent and child concepts would either be too broad or over-specified relative to the text."
263858009,Rice water (finding),Labelled “rice water” in notes,"This indicates the recorded label/descriptor is “rice water,” a Clinical finding that maps to Rice water (finding) [263858009]. The entry refrains from adding contextual attributes such as bodily source or etiology, preventing misclassification to child concepts. Parent concepts are less precise. The documentation phrasing confirms the same descriptor without altering the intended concept."
257675001,Public hall (environment),Public-use hall,"The wording 'public-use hall' conveys a hall intended for public use, matching the meaning of 'public hall'. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographic location. SCTID 257675001 is the precise match. This phrasing does not introduce a different hall type (e.g., school assembly hall or concert hall) and avoids a broader building category. No additional attributes are present, maintaining the environment-focused code."
108643006,Product containing phthalazinone derivative (product),Recorded medication: product containing phthalazinone derivative,"This entry documents a recorded medication that is a product containing a phthalazinone derivative, mapping to SCTID 108643006. The main concept is the product-level entity with its phthalazinone derivative ingredient class. SNOMED CT category: Product. The documentation context does not add dose form, route, or specific agent. Parent concepts lack the ingredient class; child concepts would be more specific than the wording allows."
217973006,Accident caused by metal sawing machine (event),Accident involving metal sawing machine,"Main concept: accident with involvement of a metal sawing machine as the causal mechanism. No injury characteristics, timing, or location are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Event. 'Involving' is a clinically accepted way to indicate causal association here and remains equivalent to 'caused by,' supporting the exact match to 217973006. Broader machinery accident concepts would be less precise, and sibling concepts tied to non-metal saws or non-machine tools would misrepresent the specified device. There is no disorder content; it is a mechanism event only."
229059009,Report (record artifact),Share the report,"The phrase concerns sharing a report artifact, with no subtype or content qualifier provided. The most accurate SNOMED CT mapping is 'Report (record artifact)' [229059009] in the 'Record artifact' hierarchy. Sharing is a workflow context and does not imply a different type of document (e.g., letter, referral, lab report), so parent or child concepts would be less appropriate."
735330008,Vulnerable adult care plan (record artifact),Case management: vulnerable adult care plan,"This entry provides a case management context but the core concept remains a care plan for a vulnerable adult, which is a Record artifact. The most precise SNOMED CT match is 735330008. The contextual tag 'case management' does not alter the nature of the artifact or introduce attributes that would change the code, and it does not map to a different concept such as case management plan without the vulnerable adult specification."
831000,Drawer test (procedure),Physical exam: drawer test,"This documentation line indicates that during the physical exam, a drawer test was performed, which is a procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, with the best match being Drawer test (procedure) [831000]. The entry avoids specifying joint or anterior/posterior direction, so children like 'knee anterior drawer test' are not appropriate. It references the test, not the result, hence not a finding."
84986000,Product containing corticotropin releasing factor (product),Medication: corticotropin releasing factor product,"The phrase frames a medication whose active component is corticotropin releasing factor, clearly indicating a product. This aligns to the Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product) category. There are no added attributes such as dose, route, or formulation that would require a clinical drug child mapping, and the ingredient naming makes it more precise than parent categories. No alternate substances are introduced, avoiding sibling concepts. The inclusion of 'medication' does not change the concept; it still maps to 84986000."
104998006,Triokinase measurement (procedure),Triokinase enzyme measurement,"The wording directly states measurement of the enzyme triokinase, corresponding to Triokinase measurement (procedure) (SCTID 104998006). No extra attributes (e.g., specimen type or abnormal results) are given. Parent concepts like Enzyme measurement lack the named enzyme specificity, while sibling concepts for other enzymes would be mismatches, making this procedure code the most precise."
84026000,Fall from moving vehicle (event),Discharge summary notes fall from moving vehicle as mechanism,"Identifying the mechanism as a fall from a moving vehicle in a discharge summary still denotes the same Event concept, mapping to SNOMED CT 84026000. The documentation context does not alter the underlying mechanism, and the entry lacks details that would point to child concepts (specific vehicle) or sibling mechanisms (jump/ejection). It is more specific than broader parent concepts, so 84026000 is the most precise code."
280332006,Structure of lateral deep branch of cervical plexus (body structure),Deep lateral branch of the cervical plexus,"This synonym reverses 'lateral deep' to 'deep lateral' but remains clinically equivalent, referencing the same branch of the cervical plexus as a Body structure. It contains no additional attributes and corresponds specifically to SCTID 280332006 rather than to the entire plexus or other branches. Child concepts specifying particular muscular branches are more specific than intended and thus inappropriate."
468548001,Endoscopic electromechanical surgical system (physical object),Endoscopic electromechanical surgical system,"The entry directly states the device name, which is a physical object used in endoscopic surgery and incorporates electromechanical components. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This is an exact match to SCTID 468548001 because it specifies a surgical system for endoscopy that is electromechanical, aligning precisely with the concept. Broader parent concepts like “electromechanical surgical system” lack the endoscopic qualifier, and narrower children or siblings (e.g., laparoscopic or robotic variants, or component-only devices) are not indicated. No additional attributes are introduced."
122644002,Specimen from large intestine obtained by incisional biopsy (specimen),Patient statement: sample from my large intestine taken by incisional biopsy,"The patient phrasing refers to a sample from the large intestine obtained by incisional biopsy, which clearly maps to a Specimen concept. SCTID 122644002 is appropriate as it encodes the same source and method. A parent concept would be too broad without the method, and siblings with alternative procedures (endoscopic, excisional, needle) are not supported. The patient context does not convert this into a procedure or diagnosis; it remains a specimen description."
288528003,Multiple episode (qualifier value),Multiple episode (qualifier),"This entry makes explicit that the term ""multiple episode"" is used as a qualifier, which matches SNOMED CT’s Qualifier value category. It conveys more than one episode without adding other details. SCTID 288528003 is the exact code for this value. A parent concept such as generic ""Qualifier value"" lacks the specificity of multiplicity. Siblings like ""Single episode"" or ""First episode"" contradict the word ""multiple,"" and other siblings like ""Recurrent"" or ""Intermittent"" imply specific temporal patterns not stated. The parenthetical clarification does not change the meaning; it ensures the reader understands the usage context while the code remains uniquely mapped to Multiple episode (qualifier value)."
218129009,"Accidents caused by hot substance or object, caustic or corrosive material and steam (event)","Accidental contact with hot substance or object, caustic/corrosive material, or steam","The entry states an accidental contact event and includes hot substance/object, caustic/corrosive material, or steam as the causal agents, aligning with the combined category. No injury details or contextual attributes are added. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It fits SCTID 218129009 rather than more specific children (e.g., accidental contact with steam alone). A parent concept like generic contact accident would be too broad. 'Accidental contact' is an acceptable synonym for an accidental event with these agents and does not change the code selection."
400706002,Low protein gluten free breakfast cereal (product),Low-protein gluten-free breakfast cereal requested,"This request identifies a breakfast cereal with low-protein and gluten-free features, fitting the Product hierarchy and matching SCTID 400706002. The request context does not alter the product’s attributes or add extraneous details. Parents like general breakfast cereal or single-attribute variants would be too broad; more specific children adding other qualities would not match the wording."
412572001,Drug dispersant (product),"Label indicates ""drug dispersant"" as component","This states a product label lists a “drug dispersant” among components, identifying the excipient class used to promote dispersion. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product (Product). It corresponds to SCTID 412572001 because the label terminology matches the dispersant function. It is more precise than the parent excipient concept and does not point to sibling roles such as emulsifier or disintegrant. No specific substance is named, so child concepts are not implicated."
268459005,Oral contraceptive advice (finding),Patient instructions include oral contraceptive advice,"The statement indicates that patient instructions include advice regarding oral contraceptives, denoting a Clinical finding of advice provided. No attributes beyond the oral method are stated. Oral contraceptive advice (finding) [268459005] is the most precise code. Mapping to a general education or counseling procedure would be less appropriate, as the documentation emphasizes advice content rather than a performed procedure. The phrase remains specific to oral contraceptives."
34381000087105,Satellite clinic (environment),Procedure location was the satellite clinic,"This documentation indicates that the procedure took place at a satellite clinic, which is an environmental descriptor of the care setting. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The explicit environment term supports the precise selection of Satellite clinic (environment) and avoids overgeneral parents (Clinic) or unrelated siblings (e.g., Ambulatory surgical center). No specialty or service-type attributes are added."
1069811000000104,Difficulty assessing risk (finding),Risk assessment difficult,"This entry conveys that assessing risk is difficult, capturing the same Clinical finding as Difficulty assessing risk (1069811000000104). It avoids introducing new attributes (no cause or context beyond difficulty) and does not imply inability, deferral, or a specific risk type. More general parent categories would be imprecise, and siblings such as 'Risk not assessed' or 'Unable to assess risk' would misrepresent the documented difficulty rather than impossibility. The paraphrase 'Risk assessment difficult' is a clinically equivalent synonym."
328688002,Gluten-free cake mix (product),Diet order: gluten-free cake mix,"This entry specifies a product included in a diet order: a gluten-free cake mix. The core concept is the Product Gluten-free cake mix (product), SCTID 328688002. The ordering context does not add attributes to alter the code. Parent concepts without gluten-free designation or unrelated gluten-free mixes for other baked goods are less appropriate, confirming 328688002."
217084001,Fall on or from escalator (event),Fall involving an escalator,"The wording specifies a fall with escalator involvement, which directly aligns with “Fall on or from escalator.” The SNOMED CT category is Event. It does not introduce additional details such as cause beyond the escalator context, nor does it add injury outcomes or time references. This is a precise fit for SCTID 217084001, rather than parent concepts like “Accidental fall” or sibling concepts like “Fall on stairs,” because the escalator is specifically stated and the action is a fall."
258554004,Fecal concretion specimen (specimen),Specimen label indicates: fecal concretion,"The entry references the specimen label and specifies 'fecal concretion', making it clear that the sample type is a concretion of fecal material. The best match is 'Fecal concretion specimen' (258554004), categorized as Specimen. This avoids added attributes such as site or test purpose. Parent concepts are overly broad, and sibling clinical finding concepts do not fit the specimen-oriented wording."
106134006,Perception AND/OR perception disturbance (finding),Perception/perceptual disturbance section,"This is a neutral section label that includes both perception and disturbance under one clinical finding domain, without introducing attributes like severity or modality. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. It matches SCTID 106134006 because it denotes the umbrella concept. Using 'perceptual disturbance' alone would better fit a child concept; generic parent categories would lack the specific perceptual focus provided here."
721631001,Bone marrow pathology biopsy report (record artifact),Report: bone marrow biopsy pathology,"This is a concise labeling of a report containing pathology related to a bone marrow biopsy. The concept is a Record artifact, for which SCTID 721631001 is exact. It neither denotes the biopsy procedure nor a general pathology report, and it avoids narrower sibling types like aspirate cytology reports. The compact phrasing is an equivalent representation of the same artifact without additional attributes."
360837003,Osseointegrated bone anchor (physical object),Osseointegrated bone anchor implant,"The term 'implant' here describes the nature of the anchor as an implantable device, which remains the same physical object concept. No site, laterality, or brand details are included. This maps to SNOMED CT Physical object SCTID 360837003. It should not be coded to a procedural insertion or a finding of device presence, as the entry refers to the device itself. Parent concepts like generic implants or anchors are less precise, and sibling devices such as abutments are not described."
224665006,Fixed-site mobile home (environment),Case management: living environment is a fixed-site mobile home,"This entry defines the living environment as a fixed-site mobile home and adds no extraneous attributes (e.g., risk factors or geographic details). The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The wording matches concept 224665006 by specifying fixed-site, making it more exact than the parent Mobile home (environment) and excluding sibling or unrelated dwelling types."
224717003,Circulation areas in building (environment),Interior circulation areas (building environment),"This describes interior circulation areas as part of the building environment. Category: Environment or geographical location (environment). It fits SCTID 224717003 by naming the general class of in-building circulation areas, without pointing to a particular architectural element. The parent “Building (environment)” is too broad, while child/sibling options like “Corridor (environment)” are too narrow. The parenthetical note reinforces the environment context without adding attributes."
33802005,"Enema bag, device (physical object)",Enema bag required for nursing care tonight.,"This note indicates the need for the enema bag device for nursing tasks, identifying the specific physical object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). It matches SCTID 33802005 as it references the bag component only, not a kit or other parts. Parent concepts are too generic, and sibling concepts like 'enema bottle' or 'nozzle' would be incorrect. The timing/location context does not introduce new attributes affecting code selection."
126255008,"Red blood cells, human, Adenine-Saline (AS-5) added (product)",Human red cells suspended in AS-5 solution,"This entry describes human red cells suspended/preserved in AS-5 additive solution, which corresponds to the standard RBC blood product formulation without extra processing attributes. SNOMED CT category: Product. The explicit AS-5 identifies SCTID 126255008. Choosing a parent concept (human red cells without additive) would be less specific, and siblings (AS-1, AS-3, CPDA-1, washed/irradiated) would be incorrect. 'Suspended in AS-5 solution' is synonymous with 'AS-5 added' in product terminology."
1285139003,Complete response of neoplasm to antineoplastic neoadjuvant therapy (qualifier value),CR to neoadjuvant antineoplastic therapy,"This uses the standard oncology abbreviation 'CR' for complete response, tied to neoadjuvant antineoplastic therapy. The main concept is the response category, not a diagnostic finding or procedure, so the SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 1285139003 fits exactly because it encodes complete response of a neoplasm to antineoplastic neoadjuvant therapy. More general or parent qualifiers lack the neoadjuvant specificity, and specifying pCR (pathologic complete response) would be a different sibling concept; this entry avoids that. The abbreviation is clinically equivalent to 'complete response' and does not introduce additional attributes."
46226009,Cervicectomy with synchronous colporrhaphy (procedure),Procedure: trachelectomy with simultaneous colporrhaphy,"‘Trachelectomy’ (non-radical) is a synonym for cervicectomy, and 'simultaneous' conveys synchronous timing with colporrhaphy. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This matches SCTID 46226009. A code for trachelectomy alone or colporrhaphy alone would be incomplete, and specifying radical trachelectomy or anterior/posterior colporrhaphy would introduce detail not present, so the combined synchronous concept is the most precise."
277923006,Pulse oximetry waveform (observable entity),Pulse oximetry waveform observed,"The statement identifies the observation of the waveform from a pulse oximeter, i.e., the pulse oximetry waveform. This is an Observable entity and matches 277923006. No saturation values, heart rate, or artifact/quality descriptors are present, so it does not fit siblings like oxygen saturation observables or pleth quality findings. General waveform parents are less precise than the oximetry-specific waveform."
446357008,Stereognostic test score (observable entity),Stereognostic exam score,"Using ‘exam’ instead of ‘test’ does not alter the medical meaning; it continues to refer to the score yielded by the stereognosis examination. The main concept is an observable score with no added attributes. The most appropriate SNOMED CT match is 446357008 (Stereognostic test score), categorized as Observable entity. Mapping to the procedure ‘stereognosis exam’ would be incorrect because the entry denotes the score, not the act of testing. Parent observables would be too generic, and clinical findings would add interpretive attributes not present here."
217999004,Accident caused by transmission shaft (event),Imaging indication: accident caused by transmission shaft.,"The imaging history indicates an accident with the cause specified as a transmission shaft, and adds no extraneous attributes. Category: Event. SCTID 217999004 is the precise mapping, as it encodes the external cause of an accident due to a transmission shaft. Parent concepts for general machinery accidents or siblings naming other machine parts would be less specific. The indication phrasing is a documentation context that retains the same causal meaning and thus the same code."
10761671000119108,Supervision of high risk pregnancy for primigravida age 15 years or younger done (situation),High-risk antenatal supervision session done for primigravida ≤15.,"This statement indicates that an antenatal supervision session has been done for a high-risk pregnancy in a primigravida aged ≤15. The core concepts are supervision, high-risk classification, primigravida, age ≤15, and completion. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 10761671000119108 precisely encodes completed supervision for this subgroup. Parent concepts like generic high-risk antenatal supervision done without the primigravida ≤15 detail would be less specific, and siblings indicating not done or planned would be incorrect. “Session” is a harmless synonym for the conducted supervision event."
127461003,Specimen from pleura obtained by pleurectomy (specimen),Pleural surgical specimen from pleurectomy,"This indicates a surgical specimen of pleura with the sourcing procedure explicitly as pleurectomy. The main concept is a pleural specimen obtained by pleurectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 127461003 by incorporating both site and method. A parent concept without method would be insufficiently specific, and procedural codes would be incorrect because the emphasis is on the specimen. The term 'surgical specimen' is a harmless synonym that maintains equivalence."
228935006,Ounce/meal (qualifier value),Patient reports using ounces per meal as the unit,"This patient-stated context still only designates the unit ounces per meal, mapping to the Qualifier value Ounce/meal (SCTID 228935006). It introduces no numeric measurement, ounce subtype, or alternate denominator. Parent concepts are too generic, and siblings such as ounce/day or ounce/feeding would be different unit ratios; therefore, Ounce/meal is the most accurate coding."
1222588006,American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical N category allowable value (qualifier value),AJCC clinical N (cN) qualifier value,"The entry directly names the AJCC clinical N (cN) qualifier value, indicating it is the allowable value domain for the clinical nodal category. This is a Qualifier value concept and aligns with SCTID 1222588006. It avoids specifics such as N0/N1, site, edition, or pathologic/staging differences, so broader parent concepts and specific child/sibling concepts are less appropriate. The inclusion of '(cN)' is a standard shorthand that does not alter the concept."
766918008,Product containing microbial agent (product),Formulary entry: product containing microbial agent,"The formulary context still centers the product that contains a microbial agent and refrains from specifying organism type, dose, route, or use case. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 766918008 is appropriate because it encodes products defined by microbial agent ingredients. Broader parent products lack the ingredient specificity, while narrower children (e.g., bacterial agent products, probiotic products, vaccine products) are not justified by the general wording."
307481007,Every other year (qualifier value),Alternate years,"The wording indicates occurrence in alternating calendar years, directly equivalent to every other year. This is purely a frequency qualifier, so the SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the correct concept is 'Every other year (qualifier value)' SCTID 307481007. Broader periodicity parents are less precise, while siblings like 'Every year' or 'Every 3 years' conflict with the explicit alternating-year cadence. No added details (e.g., start year, condition) are introduced."
223398003,Room of building (environment),Enclosed room within the building,"This entry describes a closed indoor space that is a room inside a building, which is exactly the concept Room of building (environment), SCTID 223398003. Category: Environment or geographical location. The word 'enclosed' does not introduce a new attribute beyond the inherent nature of a room; it reiterates that the environment is a room. It avoids any functional qualifiers (e.g., operating, waiting) that would map to child concepts. Parent classes like Indoor environment are too broad since a specific room is indicated."
401710007,"Elastic band truss scrotal, double (physical object)",Applied a double elastic scrotal truss today,"This documents application of a scrotal truss that is elastic and double, capturing the exact device identity. The category is Physical object. Parent concepts lacking the double attribute are less specific, and siblings such as single or non-elastic trusses are excluded by the wording. The temporal phrase does not alter the object coded; thus, SCTID 401710007 is appropriate."
38623000,Zinc-69 (substance),Chemical: Zinc-69,"This entry presents zinc-69 in a chemical cataloging style, naming the specific isotope without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the exact mapping is Zinc-69 (substance) SCTID 38623000. Broader concepts like 'Zinc' or 'Zinc isotope' are less precise; other zinc isotopes would not match the specified mass number 69."
1208609009,Measured quantity of intake of nonessential amino acid in 24 hours (observable entity),Nutrition assessment parameter: measured quantity of nonessential amino acid intake over 24 hours,"This is a contextualized label for the same observable entity: the measured quantity of nonessential amino acid intake across 24 hours. The category is Observable entity, and the entry still describes the variable being measured, not a procedure or interpretation. Parent concepts missing the 'nonessential' qualifier are too general, and child concepts focusing on individual nonessential amino acids would not match the broader class here. The context 'nutrition assessment parameter' does not alter the core concept."
223770004,Palawan (geographic location),Place name Palawan documented,"The entry documents Palawan as a place name, indicating the geographic location without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The correct code is Palawan (geographic location) [223770004]. Parent concepts (e.g., Philippines) would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., province or island forms) would be too specific given the wording. The documentation context is incidental and does not affect the concept selection."
721917003,Physician discharge concise summary (record artifact),Doctor discharge concise summary,"This phrase denotes a discharge concise summary authored by a doctor, which is clinically synonymous with physician. The main concept is the concise discharge summary document, with explicit attributes: author = doctor/physician and concise format. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The synonym 'doctor' is equivalent to 'physician' and does not alter code selection. Including 'concise' differentiates it from broader record artifacts like 'Physician discharge summary' and avoids mapping to siblings such as nurse-authored summaries, making 721917003 the most precise match."
1345107007,Combined urethral and genital swab (specimen),Combined urethral and genital swab for lab processing,"This wording denotes the specimen as a combined swab from urethral and genital sites and mentions its laboratory processing context without changing the specimen identity. The concept is a Specimen—specifically a combined urethral and genital swab. SCTID 1345107007 matches exactly; broader or single-site codes are less appropriate. The phrase 'for lab processing' is contextual and does not introduce attributes like cause, timing, or test type; thus, the concept remains the combined specimen."
282138008,International System of Units unit of radionuclide source activity (qualifier value),Report radionuclide source activity using SI unit,"The directive form still targets the Qualifier value concept for SI unit of radionuclide source activity, aligning with SCTID 282138008. It specifies SI and the quantity (source activity) but does not identify a specific unit such as 'becquerel', thereby remaining at the correct level of abstraction. It excludes non-SI siblings (e.g., curie) and avoids broader parents by making the SI constraint explicit. No extra clinical attributes are present."
304105001,Butyric acid and/or butyric acid derivative (substance),Substance: butyric acid and/or derivative,"The entry labels the item as a substance and specifies either butyric acid or one of its derivatives. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This aligns with SCTID 304105001, which is defined for butyric acid and/or its derivatives. It avoids mapping to narrower child concepts (e.g., only butyric acid, or a single named derivative) and does not invoke broader parent categories. Contextual labeling does not add clinical attributes."
103090006,Cancer antigen 549 (substance),Cancer Ag 549,"This synonym abbreviates 'antigen' as 'Ag' while retaining the exact numeric identifier. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It points to the specific substance Cancer antigen 549 (SCTID 103090006) rather than a general cancer antigen or different numbered antigen. The phrasing does not imply a procedure, measurement, or clinical finding."
164931005,ST elevation (observable entity),ECG shows ST elevation,"This entry reports an electrocardiogram demonstrating ST elevation, clearly specifying the observable change. Category: Observable entity. It maps to SNOMED CT 164931005 because it denotes the specific ST-segment elevation finding, not a general abnormal ECG or a diagnostic conclusion like myocardial infarction. Mentioning the ECG context does not introduce new clinical attributes beyond the observation itself."
772786005,Medical certificate (record artifact),Medical certificate documented in the chart,"The wording confirms that a medical certificate artifact is documented within the chart, without describing the certificate’s subtype or purpose. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the best match is Medical certificate (record artifact) [772786005]. It avoids narrower concepts like sickness or death certificates and does not suggest a different document type like clinical note or report. The descriptor ""documented"" simply indicates presence in records and does not change the artifact."
362828007,Entire lateral surface of fourth toe (body structure),Exam focus: entire lateral surface of the 4th toe,"The phrase frames the anatomy in an exam context but the core concept is the entire lateral surface of the fourth toe. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This aligns directly with SCTID 362828007, since it denotes the whole lateral surface on toe four. It would not fit broader toe structures or alternative surfaces, and it avoids left/right laterality, keeping the mapping precise."
183914001,Private referral to anesthetist (procedure),Private anesthetist referral initiated.,"The main concept is initiating a private referral to an anesthetist, categorized as a Procedure. “Initiated” reflects the referral action taking place without adding clinical attributes. SCTID 183914001 precisely represents a private referral to an anesthetist. A parent concept for general referrals lacks the private context, and sibling concepts (e.g., consultation or clinic referrals) are different procedures. The wording avoids specifying indication, timing beyond the action, or other attributes."
846612002,Osteopathy clinic (environment),Exam location: osteopathy clinic,"The text identifies the exam location as an osteopathy clinic, which remains an environment concept and fits SCTID 846612002. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Although it mentions ""exam location,"" the key coded concept is the clinic environment. Parent concepts like generic clinic are less specific, and siblings representing other modalities or specialties would be incorrect. No additional qualifiers (e.g., inpatient unit) are introduced."
85595005,"Abdominal aortic pulse, function (observable entity)",Follow-up: abdominal aortic pulse function,"In follow-up context, the item referenced is the functional parameter of the abdominal aortic pulse, which is the observable entity SCTID 85595005. No status or interpretation is stated; it simply identifies the observable being considered. Broader parents or sibling observables would be less specific, and finding codes implying normal/abnormal results are not supported by the text. The follow-up context does not change the coded concept."
223701004,Cuba (geographic location),Origin noted: Cuba,"The phrase names Cuba as the origin, yet the only codable concept present is the place itself. This falls under the Geographic location category. The most specific code is Cuba (geographic location) SCTID 223701004, not a general origin or exposure concept. No child locations are specified and no sibling entities are implied, keeping the mapping uniquely to Cuba."
1285379001,Presence of direct invasion by primary malignant neoplasm of adrenal gland to renal vein (observable entity),Primary adrenal cancer with direct extension into the renal vein (present),"This entry asserts that direct extension from a primary adrenal cancer into the renal vein is present. The core concepts are the primary adrenal malignant neoplasm, the renal vein as the invaded structure, and the presence of direct invasion. This precisely aligns with SCTID 1285379001 (Observable entity). Using “cancer” as a synonym for malignant neoplasm is clinically acceptable and does not change the meaning. Parent concepts that do not specify the renal vein or directness would be too broad, and sibling observables involving other anatomical targets would be incorrect. It is not a disorder code, as it records an observable tumor extension rather than the disease itself."
288573005,Community health care environment (environment),Context: community health care environment,"This entry denotes the contextual environment of care as community health care. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It is a direct match to SCTID 288573005 because it does not add other environmental qualifiers (e.g., inpatient, residential, school) and avoids organizational or facility-type specifics. Using 'context' does not change the semantic intent; it still designates the environment, not a broader or narrower setting."
223812007,Roscommon (geographic location),Documented place: Roscommon,"The entry documents Roscommon as a place without added attributes, leaving the geographic location as the sole codable concept. Category: Geographic location (Location). The generic descriptor “place” is neutral and does not impose administrative or settlement distinctions. Thus, Roscommon (geographic location) [223812007] is the best match, not any parent, child, or sibling concept."
1137664003,Product containing melanocortin receptor agonist (product),Melanocortin receptor agonist drug product,"This entry specifies a drug product defined by its action as a melanocortin receptor agonist, clearly referring to a medicinal product class. It does not include route, dose, brand, specific agent, or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product, and 'Product containing melanocortin receptor agonist (product)' (1137664003) is the precise match. Using a parent like 'drug product' would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts naming specific ingredients or dosage forms would add precision not supported by the text. The wording 'drug product' is a valid synonym for medicinal product and maintains the appropriate code."
32531000119102,Supervision of high risk pregnancy with history of previous precipitate labor done (situation),Antenatal high-risk supervision for prior rapid labor — completed.,"This statement conveys completion of antenatal supervision for a high-risk pregnancy, with the risk due to prior rapid/precipitous labor, matching SNOMED CT 32531000119102 as a Situation with explicit context. “Rapid labor” is a clinically understandable synonym for precipitate labor. The entry is more specific than generic high-risk supervision done and does not introduce other attributes pointing to siblings. The completion language supports the situation rather than a procedure without explicit context."
1098991000119103,History of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy using robotic assistance (situation),History: robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.,"The entry states a history context and identifies the exact procedure: radical prostatectomy using a laparoscopic approach with robotic assistance. That combination directly fits the target SNOMED Situation concept. Concepts for “history of prostatectomy” or “history of laparoscopic prostatectomy” without robotic assistance would be less accurate because the entry explicitly includes robotic assistance. No additional attributes (e.g., indication or date) are introduced."
737115008,Hexagonal phase phospholipid technique (qualifier value),Use of hexagonal phase phospholipid technique,"The entry reports use of the hexagonal phase phospholipid technique; it does not specify a procedure or outcome, remaining a method-only descriptor. The proper SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 737115008 is the precise code naming this technique. Parent or sibling technique concepts would either be too general or different, and mapping to a test/procedure concept would be incorrect because the wording conveys only the technique."
713955001,Vascular catheter introduction needle (physical object),Catheter introduction needle (vascular),"Main concept: a needle used for catheter introduction with explicit limitation to the vascular system. No additional attributes such as technique (e.g., Seldinger), catheter subtype, or intended vessel are stated. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This is a clear synonym for 'Vascular catheter introduction needle' (713955001). A general 'catheter introduction needle' without the vascular qualifier would be too broad (parent), and variants like 'arterial catheter puncture needle' would be siblings/children with added specificity. The parenthetical 'vascular' ensures the concept remains within the exact intended device category."
734163000,Care plan (record artifact),Patient’s care plan,"This is the patient-associated care plan as a documented artifact, not an action or finding. In SNOMED CT, the category is Record artifact, and the best match is Care plan (record artifact). Possession context (patient’s) does not imply subtype (advance, discharge, specialty-specific) or process. Hence, broader parent concepts are too general and specific siblings/children are not indicated."
1217561007,Removal of negative pressure wound dressing (procedure),Doffed wound VAC dressing,"‘Doffed’ is a synonym for removed in clinical context, and 'wound VAC dressing' identifies the negative pressure dressing. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The correct code is SCTID 1217561007 for removal of the negative pressure wound dressing. General dressing removal would be too broad, and siblings such as application or change do not match the term 'doffed' indicating removal. The entry does not imply removal of the device hardware, focusing solely on dressing removal."
242353006,Accidental ingestion of thornapple seeds (event),Patient reports accidentally swallowing thornapple seeds,"The documented concept is an accidental oral ingestion with the specific substance being thornapple seeds; “swallowing” is a clinically equivalent synonym to ingestion in this context. This belongs to the SNOMED CT Event category. SCTID 242353006 is the exact match, whereas parent concepts like accidental ingestion (unspecified) lack the specific agent, and sibling concepts like accidental ingestion of thornapple leaves or berries would be incorrect because the entry explicitly states seeds. No disorder or toxicity outcome is implied."
243283009,Kurthia bessoni (organism),Scientific name: Kurthia bessoni,"This statement provides the scientific (binomial) name Kurthia bessoni, with no added attributes like pathogenicity or test status. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Referring to the scientific name is synonymous with the organism concept; it does not broaden to the genus Kurthia nor imply a related disorder. Therefore, the Kurthia bessoni (organism) concept is the most precise match."
773596008,Care of elderly care plan (record artifact),Documented care plan for the elderly,"The phrase indicates the presence of a documented care plan tailored to elderly individuals, not an action or diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps directly to Care of elderly care plan (record artifact), SCTID 773596008, since it clearly specifies both 'care plan' and the elderly focus. Generic care plan codes would lose specificity, and alternative artifacts like discharge plans or assessments are not indicated. The wording is a synonymous paraphrase of the preferred term."
879870006,Measured intake of fluid in 24 hours (observable entity),Fluid intake measured across a 24-hour period,"This describes fluid intake that has been measured and summed over a defined 24-hour period, without specifying route or value. The core concept is an Observable entity focused on the 24-hour measurement of intake. It fits Measured intake of fluid in 24 hours (SCTID 879870006) precisely. Parent terms omitting the 24-hour timeframe are less precise, and siblings like fluid output or net balance are incorrect because the entry addresses intake only. The wording is a paraphrase that keeps the same semantics without changing the coding."
5461000179100,Centralized emergency service report (record artifact),Centralized emergency service report document,"The phrase 'report document' clarifies the artifact nature without adding new attributes, identifying a centralized report regarding emergency service. Main concept: a report document. Category: Record artifact. This maps exactly to 'Centralized emergency service report' and is not simply a generic clinical document nor a specific emergency department or EMS report subtype. The addition of 'document' is a neutral synonym that preserves the code intent."
223715002,Brazil (geographic location),Brazil—sovereign state,"Labeling Brazil as a sovereign state identifies the same geopolitical place without changing meaning. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The precise match is Brazil (geographic location) SCTID 223715002. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings denote other countries. The entry does not introduce patient-specific or event-related attributes."
224857005,Grammar school (environment),Scene: grammar school,"The wording identifies the scene type as a grammar school without describing an event, keeping the focus solely on the environment. The concept is a contextual place. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224857005 is the precise match since it denotes the grammar school environment. Broad parents (School environment) and unrelated siblings (e.g., University environment) are less appropriate. 'Scene' is a contextual term and does not introduce new coded attributes."
763780009,Medication dosage increase declined (situation),Medication dosage increase declined,"The entry clearly states that an increase in medication dosage was declined. The main concept is a refused dose escalation without specifying medication, reason, or timing. This is a Situation with explicit context, and SNOMED CT code 763780009 (Medication dosage increase declined) is the most precise match. Broader parent concepts like generic treatment or medication refusal are less specific, and sibling concepts such as 'medication dose decrease declined' or 'dose increased' do not fit. The phrasing matches the preferred term exactly, ensuring unambiguous coding to this concept."
1269548004,Planned procedure section (record artifact),Planned procedures section,"This wording refers to the same record artifact section, with plural 'procedures' acknowledging that multiple planned procedures may be listed in the section. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 1269548004 is the most precise match because the phrase identifies the structural component of a note that houses planned procedures, not any particular procedure or clinical intent. Parent concepts like general document sections are too broad, and sibling sections (e.g., 'Procedures performed section') would be inappropriate since this entry is explicitly about planned, not completed, procedures. The plural form does not introduce new attributes; it remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
737432000,Hyperglycemia clinical management plan (record artifact),Hyperglycemia management plan on file,"This confirms a plan targeting hyperglycemia is on file, which is a clinical management plan record artifact. Category: Record artifact. The best fit is Hyperglycemia clinical management plan (record artifact) (737432000). Selecting a parent like generic care plan would omit the specified condition. The entry does not describe the disorder itself or a discharge plan, so sibling concepts are inappropriate. 'On file' reflects status in the record, not a different artifact."
472863002,Swab from lower leg (specimen),Lower-leg swab sample,"The phrase identifies a sample (synonymous with specimen in clinical documentation) obtained as a swab from the lower leg region. This corresponds to Swab from lower leg (specimen), SCTID 472863002, in the Specimen hierarchy. It does not introduce laterality, wound, tissue specificity, or test purpose. Broader options lack the site, while narrower children like right/left lower leg would add laterality. Siblings for different sites (upper leg, foot) are not appropriate. “Sample” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “specimen” here."
420268006,Product containing A4beta2 acetylcholine receptor partial agonist (product),Rx product containing α4β2 ACh receptor partial agonist,"This indicates a prescription drug product whose active ingredient is a partial agonist at the α4β2 acetylcholine (ACh) receptor. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The mechanism and subtype match SCTID 420268006. It does not introduce attributes such as dose or indication, so it does not select a child concept. It is not a parent concept because the α4β2 subtype and partial agonist role are specified."
304377003,Structure of quadrate lobe branch of portal vein (body structure),Hepatic portal vein branch to quadrate lobe,"The entry references the hepatic portal vein and specifies the branch to the quadrate lobe, a precise anatomical Body structure. This aligns exactly with SCTID 304377003. “Hepatic portal vein” is a clinically accepted synonym for the portal vein and does not change the intended structure. Parent concepts are too nonspecific, and no other lobar branch is indicated, ruling out sibling structures."
29754006,Adenosine diphosphate ribose pyrophosphatase (substance),Stockroom item: ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase enzyme,"This denotes a stocked item and clearly names the enzyme substance ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The entry best maps to Adenosine diphosphate ribose pyrophosphatase (substance), SCTID 29754006. More generic stock or product codes would be less precise, and alternative enzymes (siblings) would not match the explicit substrate/bond indicated here."
328669009,Gluten-free white unsliced bread (product),Packaging description reads: gluten-free white unsliced bread,"The packaging text specifies a bread product with the attributes gluten-free, white, and unsliced, consistent with a SNOMED CT Product. This matches Gluten-free white unsliced bread (328669009). Parent concepts without full attributes are less precise, and siblings with different slicing status or bread type are excluded by the wording."
305607002,Under care of social services department occupational therapist (finding),Care coordinated by a social services OT,"Saying 'care coordinated by' conveys that the patient’s care is under the responsibility of the social services occupational therapist, matching the under-care relationship. The key elements are the care status, practitioner type, and social services affiliation. This is a Clinical finding. SCTID 305607002 is exact for under care of social services department OT. A parent code without the departmental specification is less precise, and siblings that refer to different settings or practitioners would miscode. The coordination phrasing does not add new attributes beyond the under-care relationship."
370068001,Tumor invasion into mediastinal lymph node with extracapsular extension (finding),"Observed: tumor invasion into mediastinal lymph node, extracapsular extension confirmed.","The observation confirms tumor invasion into a mediastinal lymph node with extracapsular extension. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. It fits SCTID 370068001 because it specifies both the mediastinal location and the presence of extracapsular extension. Parent concepts without anatomical specificity are too general, and sibling concepts excluding the extracapsular feature or describing other nodal sites are inappropriate. The confirmation language does not introduce additional attributes beyond the core finding."
17763004,Insect iridescent virus 28 (organism),Reference organism: Insect iridescent virus 28,"This entry states the organism used as a reference designation, without introducing infection status, strain-level data, or pathogenic role. It belongs to the Organism category and should be coded as SCTID 17763004. More general parent organisms or alternate numbered iridescent viruses would be inaccurate given the explicit naming."
122607002,Specimen from lung obtained by pneumonectomy (specimen),Pathology case: pneumonectomy lung specimen,"This description frames the case as involving a lung specimen collected by pneumonectomy. The main concept is a Specimen from lung obtained by pneumonectomy, which corresponds precisely to SCTID 122607002. Parent mappings to generic lung specimens are less specific, and sibling concepts tied to different procedures (lobectomy, wedge resection) would not align. The wording is a concise clinical synonym for the same concept without introducing additional attributes."
247046003,Position of ciliary body (observable entity),Ciliary body position (measurement parameter),"This denotes the measurement parameter capturing the ciliary body’s position, which is an Observable entity. SCTID 247046003 fits because it defines the observable 'position of ciliary body' rather than a procedure to measure it. This entry does not assert a result or abnormality, avoiding mapping to findings. The inclusion of 'measurement parameter' clarifies context without shifting to a procedure concept."
423542002,Stroboscope (physical object),Stroboscope documented,"This entry records that a stroboscope was documented; documentation context does not introduce any attributes beyond the identity of the device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The precise match is SCTID 423542002 for stroboscope. Parent concepts would be overly general, and children or siblings specifying particular types (e.g., laryngeal stroboscope, strobe lamp) are not indicated. The phrasing is a direct reference to the same physical object and supports the given concept code."
6942003,Level of consciousness (observable entity),Patient statement referencing “level of consciousness”,"This narrative indicates the patient is referring to the concept of 'level of consciousness' itself, not a state like loss of consciousness or altered mentation. As it names the parameter without values or methods, SNOMED CT 6942003 (Observable entity) is the precise match. It does not shift to a finding or a scale result."
223678002,Scotland (geographic location),Nation: Scotland,"The core concept is the geographic entity “Scotland,” with the descriptor “Nation” serving as a synonymous contextual label for a country-level location. No additional clinical attributes are implied. The category is Geographic location, and SCTID 223678002 maps directly to this named place. Parent concepts (United Kingdom) or sibling nations (England, Wales, Northern Ireland) are not being selected by this entry. The synonym “Nation” does not change the code selection because Scotland is still the exact geographic location."
223827007,Paxos (geographic location),Paxos,"The main concept expressed is the geographic place name Paxos, with no additional qualifiers or attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location within the Location hierarchy. The preferred term directly matches the concept Paxos (geographic location) SCTID 223827007. Broader parent concepts such as Greece or Ionian Islands would be less precise, and sibling or nearby locations (e.g., Antipaxos, Corfu, Gaios) are not mentioned. The entry is a straightforward, unambiguous reference to the specific location, so this code is the most precise match."
170150003,Child 3.5 year examination (procedure),Child exam at 3.5 years,"This entry clearly indicates an examination of a child occurring at 3.5 years of age. The concept is the age-specific pediatric exam at the three-and-a-half-year milestone. It is a Procedure in SNOMED CT, and the best match is Child 3.5 year examination (170150003). Broader child exams without age or exams at other ages are less appropriate, and the phrasing remains a straightforward synonym without introducing new attributes."
217643000,Accident due to exposure to humidity (event),Accident resulting from humidity exposure,"The wording presents an accident as the outcome of humidity exposure, stating the cause clearly. The concept is an accident caused by environmental humidity, fitting the Event category in SNOMED CT. SCTID 217643000 best matches since it encodes the accident with this specific external cause. Parent concepts lacking the cause and sibling concepts focused on different mechanisms or 'history of' contexts would be less appropriate. 'Resulting from' is a causal phrase equivalent to 'due to,' preserving code selection."
445666005,Faxed report (record artifact),Administrative record: faxed report,"Within an administrative record context, the entry identifies the artifact as a report and the modality as fax, with no additional attributes. This aligns to Faxed report (record artifact) [445666005], category Record artifact. Using a generic report artifact would ignore the fax modality, and selecting a communication procedure would misclassify the item as an action. The administrative context does not change the document’s nature; it remains a faxed report."
223718000,Ecuador (geographic location),Ecuador — the country,Adding ‘the country’ clarifies the entity type and remains synonymous with Ecuador as a geographic location. No extra attributes are introduced. Category: Geographic location (Location hierarchy). SCTID 223718000 fits precisely. Parents would be nonspecific; children or sibling country codes would not apply.
722091001,Conclusion interpretation document (record artifact),Interpretation with conclusion document,"This entry indicates a document whose content includes an interpretation accompanied by a conclusion, which is the essence of the target artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The best code is 722091001, as it represents the document focused on interpretive conclusions; generic report codes or modality-specific impression documents would not match the wording. The phrasing “with conclusion” is semantically equivalent to “interpretation conclusion” and does not change the concept."
371527006,Radiology report (record artifact),Radiology report document,"This explicitly indicates the report document produced by radiology. It focuses on the artifact, not the imaging procedure or findings. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Radiology report (record artifact) [371527006] is the precise match because it names the radiology-authored report as a document artifact. Broader parents like imaging report are too general, and children such as CT report or MRI report require modality specification that is not present."
275691001,Seen in old people's home (finding),Consultation in old people's home,It documents that a consultation (synonymous with being seen by a clinician) occurred in an old people's home. This is a Clinical finding. The code 275691001 specifically represents 'Seen in old people's home' and is thus the most exact match. More general or different facility location findings are less appropriate. Using 'consultation' here does not imply a different service level; it remains a locational finding of being seen at that setting.
126260007,"Human platelets, apheresis, leukocytes reduced (product)","Blood bank issue: human apheresis platelets, leukocyte reduced","In an issue context, the product named is human apheresis platelets that are leukocyte reduced. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and SCTID 126260007 is the exact match because it captures both the collection method (apheresis) and leukocyte reduction. Parents or siblings missing one of these attributes are less precise. The contextual phrase 'Blood bank issue' does not alter the product semantics or add prohibited attributes."
215455003,"Submersion or drowning due to jumping from burning ship, docker or stevedore injured (event)",Occupational injury recorded as submersion/drowning secondary to jumping from burning ship in a stevedore.,"This entry documents an occupational injury event where a stevedore experienced submersion/drowning secondary to jumping from a burning ship. It includes occupation, mechanism (jump), context (burning ship), and outcome (submersion/drowning). The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 215455003 is the exact match due to its inclusion of the docker/stevedore role and the specific external cause. Parent concepts without occupational or burning context are too general, and sibling concepts with different mechanisms or victim roles are incorrect. The phrasing 'secondary to' maintains causal linkage without introducing additional attributes like severity or outcome classification."
223837002,Islands in region of Italy (geographic location),Island locations in the regions of Italy,"This variant names island locations within Italy’s regions, preserving the same geographic grouping. It falls under the SNOMED CT category Geographic location and matches SCTID 223837002. Using 'island locations' emphasizes place-type without changing scope. Parent concepts (e.g., 'Regions of Italy') ignore the island feature, and child instances (e.g., named islands) are narrower. Siblings that refer to non-island locations or national-level islands would be less precise than the regional framing."
709341001,Antigen of Flavivirus (substance),Antigen derived from Flavivirus,"Describing the antigen as derived from Flavivirus is clinically equivalent to 'Antigen of Flavivirus' and denotes a substance in the SNOMED CT Substance hierarchy. No further properties (e.g., protein subtype, test result, or specific virus within the genus) are added. Therefore, SCTID 709341001 is the exact match, and neither the generic parent antigen nor more specific child antigens are appropriate."
365590009,Finding of serology: organism (finding),Diagnostic report: serology finding in the context of an organism.,"This diagnostic report statement places a serology finding in the context of an organism, with no extra attributes like identity, titer, or result interpretation. The main concept is a serology-based clinical finding related to an organism. Category: Clinical finding. The precise SNOMED code is Finding of serology: organism (finding) (365590009), because it expresses serology findings that involve an organism. The parent concept is less specific, and any child/sibling specifying organism type or positivity would exceed what is stated. The phrasing “in the context of an organism” is clinically equivalent to the organism axis used by the concept."
72637009,Trypanosoma rangeli (organism),Microorganism — Trypanosoma rangeli,"This phrasing identifies Trypanosoma rangeli as a microorganism, which it is, and references the species. It aligns to the Organism category concept SCTID 72637009. The entry avoids any clinical state such as infection or positivity, so parent, finding, or disorder codes are inappropriate. The species-level identification makes this the most precise match rather than genus or sibling species."
242230007,Hit by aircraft (event),Reports being hit by aircraft,"This is a patient-reported formulation of the same event: being hit by an aircraft. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The presence of 'reports' is a documentation context and does not change the coded event. It remains specific to the mechanism without implying other attributes. Concepts like 'aircraft accident' or 'collision' are broader or different scenarios, and detailed subtypes (e.g., propeller strike) are not stated. SCTID 242230007 fits best."
706352008,Contrast medium injection system (physical object),Contrast medium injection system in use,"The statement notes the device is in use and explicitly names it, keeping the focus on the physical object. The main concept is the system that delivers contrast by injection. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This aligns with Contrast medium injection system (SCTID 706352008). Mapping to broader parents would lose contrast specificity, and mapping to specialized children would overconstrain details not provided. No additional attributes (e.g., route, modality, powered vs manual) are implied."
122656001,Tissue specimen from gallbladder (specimen),Tissue sample from gallbladder,"This clearly states a sample of tissue sourced from the gallbladder, corresponding to a Specimen concept. The most accurate code is Tissue specimen from gallbladder (122656001). Using a broader parent like Tissue specimen is too generic, and children implying biopsy, excision, or fixation are not indicated. The term ‘sample’ is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that does not change the code selection."
1362035007,Number of biological children (observable entity),Tally of biological children,"The word 'tally' conveys a numeric count, and the biological relationship is explicitly stated, making this an Observable entity corresponding to SCTID 1362035007. No additional qualifiers are present. Parent concepts such as 'Number of children' would allow non-biological relationships; sibling concepts that introduce living status or adoptive relationships are not implied, confirming this is the most precise match."
734443003,Urine specimen from ureter obtained by cystoscopy (specimen),Ureteral urine specimen collected during cystoscopy,"This statement explicitly identifies a urine specimen from the ureter and specifies the collection method as cystoscopy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The exact match is SCTID 734443003 'Urine specimen from ureter obtained by cystoscopy', which combines source (ureter) and method (cystoscopy). A parent concept like 'Urine specimen from ureter' lacks the procedural method, and siblings such as 'Urine specimen from bladder obtained by cystoscopy' or those involving ureteroscopy would not match the ureter source and cystoscopy method. The phrase 'collected during cystoscopy' is clinically equivalent to 'obtained by cystoscopy' and does not alter code selection."
1204495005,Tokelau (geographic location),Tokelau (geographic location),"The entry explicitly names the concept Tokelau and clarifies it as a geographic location, matching the SNOMED preferred term precisely. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 1204495005 is the exact concept; no broader parent categories or narrower sublocations are implied. There are no additional attributes such as political status or subdivisions, ensuring the selection is not better mapped to a parent, child, or sibling concept."
224630006,Boys boarding school (environment),Place type recorded: boys boarding school,"This entry records the place type as a boys boarding school, aligning precisely with Boys boarding school (environment) SCTID 224630006. It only identifies the environmental type and adds no attributes such as timing or location. Category: Environment. More general parent concepts omit the male-only characteristic, and sibling concepts represent different gender compositions or non-boarding schools. The phrase 'place type recorded' is a documentation label and does not change the concept selection."
716431006,Able to participate in online gaming (finding),Functional status: able to participate in online gaming.,"This documentation frames the ability within functional status but the core concept remains the ability to participate in online gaming. No additional qualifiers (e.g., level of assistance, timing) are included. As a Clinical finding, SCTID 716431006 is the precise match. Broader functional findings (e.g., general recreation participation) would be less specific, and sibling concepts such as offline gaming abilities or inability contradict the entry. The phrase is a contextualized synonym that preserves the exact content of the concept."
224063000,Louisiana (geographic location),Jurisdiction: Louisiana,"The entry uses 'Jurisdiction' as a contextual label, but the coded target remains the geographic location 'Louisiana'. The exact SNOMED CT concept is Louisiana (geographic location), SCTID 224063000, under the Location hierarchy. Referring to jurisdiction does not change the semantic to a different observation or finding. Broader parent concepts or narrower child locations would not match this explicit state-level reference."
17971005,Sedated (finding),Sedated noted by provider,"Provider documentation that the patient is sedated maps to Sedated (finding), SCTID 17971005 (Clinical finding). The phrasing identifies the observed sedation state without implying a procedure, cause, or specific level of sedation, excluding conscious or deep sedation codes. The provider attribution does not alter the core finding."
309190004,Excised salivary gland specimen (specimen),Gross: excised salivary gland submitted,"In a gross examination context, the phrase denotes that an excised salivary gland has been submitted as a specimen, which is a Specimen concept. This aligns precisely with Excised salivary gland specimen. Concepts indicating biopsy or FNA are inappropriate because the wording confirms excision, and more general parent specimens would omit either source or method."
260411009,Presence findings (qualifier value),Presence findings,"The entry states the preferred term itself, directly expressing the qualifier value for the presence of a finding. The main concept is a non-assertional value indicating that a finding exists. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 260411009 is the most precise match because it represents the general value used with the 'Has presence' attribute to denote that a finding is present. Parent concepts like 'Qualifier value' are too broad, and sibling values such as 'Absence findings' or 'Detected' would not fit because the wording does not indicate absence or detection/testing. No additional attributes (severity, timing, laterality, causation) are introduced."
223583001,Japan (geographic location),Japan—nation-state,"The term identifies Japan and characterizes it as a nation-state, which is congruent with the country-level geographic concept in SNOMED, SCTID 223583001. No additional attributes (e.g., travel, residence, or time) are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). This entry is not better mapped to a parent region or a child locality; it is the sovereign state itself. 'Nation-state' is a valid descriptive synonym that does not alter the underlying location concept."
33585002,"Silica measurement, blood (procedure)","SiO2 measurement, blood","SiO2 is the chemical notation for silica (silicon dioxide), and the entry specifies its measurement in blood. Main concept: silica (SiO2) measurement in blood. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. Using 'SiO2' is a clinically equivalent synonym for silica and does not alter code selection, mapping to SCTID 33585002. The phrase does not imply ordering or results. Concepts for other specimens or analytes (e.g., elemental silicon) are not supported by the text."
223903009,West Sussex (geographic location),West Sussex (England),"This entry names the county and adds contextual geography “(England)” without changing the concept being coded: it still precisely denotes the county West Sussex. The SNOMED CT category is Location—Geographic location. The parent concepts (England, UK) are broader and thus less precise, and siblings like East Sussex or other counties of England would not match the text. The parenthetical qualifier provides context but does not introduce a new attribute or alter the target concept."
262344008,Bebrich (qualifier value),Bebrich,"The entry is the standalone term 'Bebrich', which corresponds exactly to the SNOMED CT concept Bebrich (qualifier value) with SCTID 262344008. The main concept is a qualifier value used as a coded label without additional clinical attributes. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value. It is not a disorder, finding, procedure, or observable; it is simply the named qualifier. Selecting any parent concept like 'Qualifier value' would be less specific, and choosing a sibling would be incorrect because the label must match 'Bebrich'. No additional wording alters the semantics."
1240419009,Simple syrup (product),Simple syrup vehicle product,"The entry names simple syrup and clarifies it as a vehicle, which is consistent with its standard role but does not add specificity that would change code selection. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 1240419009 fits best because it identifies the specific vehicle product simple syrup. A generic vehicle product concept would be too broad, and any flavored or USP-labeled child would be too specific for this wording."
36701003,Both knees (body structure),Both knees,"The phrase explicitly names the anatomical location as both knees, without adding any clinical attributes. This is a pure body site reference and fits the SNOMED CT category Body structure. The most precise match is SCTID 36701003 Both knees (body structure). Concepts like Right knee or Left knee are too specific laterally, while Knee joint structure or Knee region structure introduce structural subtype detail not stated here. The wording does not imply disorder, procedure, or imaging, so no parent or sibling concept is more accurate."
364674008,Child developmental detail (observable entity),Child developmental detail field completed,"This refers to completing the EHR field for child developmental detail, preserving the observable entity concept. Category: Observable entity. It aligns with SCTID 364674008 by representing the child development detail data element, with no added status, normality, or domain. A parent concept for generic detail would not capture the child specificity, while child/sibling observables for milestones or findings would add attributes not present. The workflow context 'field completed' is neutral and maintains code accuracy."
223784009,Regions of New Zealand (geographic location),Address region: New Zealand region (unspecified),"The text denotes an address-level regional designation in New Zealand without specifying which region, keeping the concept at the class level of NZ regions. This fits the Location (Geographic location) category. It is not the country-level concept nor a particular regional child; hence, Regions of New Zealand (geographic location) is the most appropriate match. Terms like “unspecified” do not alter the geographic entity being referenced."
223517008,Ethiopia (geographic location),Geographic locale: Ethiopia,"The entry uses 'Geographic locale' to denote the place and names Ethiopia, clearly indicating the country as the location. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Location category and the concept Ethiopia (geographic location) [223517008]. It avoids mapping to broader areas or specific cities and introduces no extra attributes, making the country code the most precise fit."
14685006,Structure of basis modioli (body structure),Label: base of modiolus,"As an anatomical label, “base of modiolus” directly corresponds to the basis modioli. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and 14685006 is the exact representation. The entry avoids broader or different structures and does not add clinical descriptors, making it uniquely codable to the intended concept. The synonym is standard and equivalent."
773593000,Urology care plan (record artifact),Plan of care: urology,"This formulation denotes a care plan (plan of care) specific to urology. It is a Record artifact and does not include conditions, interventions, or timing. The most accurate code is Urology care plan (record artifact) [773593000]. Choosing the parent Care plan would omit the specialty detail, and selecting treatment or management plan siblings would change the artifact type. The colon is just formatting and does not alter the meaning."
443859009,Possible clinical finding (situation),Clinical finding possible,"This paraphrase conveys the same uncertainty: a clinical finding may be present. It fits SNOMED CT 443859009, Possible clinical finding (situation), within the Situation with explicit context hierarchy. It avoids implying confirmation or probability beyond possibility. Using “possible” rather than terms like “probable” or “suspected” ensures we do not map to sibling situations with different degrees of certainty. The wording does not introduce any specific finding or other attributes, keeping the code selection precise."
782714009,Laparoscopic pectopexy with fixation of fornix of vagina using mesh (procedure),Laparoscopic suspension of vaginal fornix to the pectineal ligament with mesh (pectopexy),"This states suspension (pectopexy) of the vaginal fornix to the pectineal ligament via laparoscopy, using mesh. Attributes: approach (laparoscopic), target site (vaginal fornix), anchor (pectineal ligament), and device (mesh). Category: Procedure. SNOMED 782714009 captures this exact composite procedure. Using a parent like “laparoscopic pectopexy” without mesh or a sibling like sacrocolpopexy (different anchor) would be inaccurate. The phrasing is a valid synonym and remains within the defined concept."
411127004,European standard series patch test product (product),Patch test product set—European standard series,"The entry denotes the set of patch test products corresponding to the European standard series, which is the specific Product concept. Referring to a 'set' aligns with the series nature without shifting to another hierarchy. It avoids generic parent mapping and rules out sibling series by naming European standard. No added attributes are present, supporting 411127004 as the precise code."
421509005,New Jersey (geographic location),New Jersey,"The text names the geographic entity New Jersey without any contextual modifiers, so the single, explicit concept is the U.S. state 'New Jersey.' The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (Location). SCTID 421509005 precisely represents this place name and is more specific than parent concepts like 'United States of America (geographic location).' It does not introduce situational findings (e.g., residence or travel) or subregions, so child or sibling locations (cities or other states) are not implied. No synonymal expansion is used here; it is the exact preferred term."
412025006,Thrombin embedded bandage (product),Thrombin embedded bandage utilized,"This indicates utilization of the product—a bandage with embedded thrombin. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and the exact code is Thrombin embedded bandage (product) SCTID 412025006. The utilization context does not introduce attributes that would shift coding to a procedure or finding. Parent concepts (generic bandage; thrombin) or siblings (other thrombin-containing devices) are less precise than the stated bandage form."
723243000,y trough (qualifier value),Feature designation — y trough,"The phrase denotes the specific designation applied to a waveform feature, namely “y trough.” No additional semantics beyond the qualifier value are present. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 723243000 is the precise match. A parent like “trough (qualifier value)” lacks the y specificity, and siblings such as “x trough” or “y descent” are different and therefore less appropriate."
736363007,Minor plastic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),In-hospital minor plastic surgery care plan,"'In-hospital' functions as a synonym for inpatient care, and 'care plan' specifies the record artifact. Category: Record artifact. The inclusion of 'minor plastic surgery' sets the surgical scope and acuity. This fits 'Minor plastic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact)' exactly. Parent concepts lacking either the surgical domain or inpatient qualifier are less accurate, and sibling variants such as outpatient care plans or major plastic surgery are excluded by the wording. No additional attributes (e.g., timing, laterality) are introduced."
1003765005,Entire epiphysis of distal phalanx of middle finger (body structure),"Entire epiphysis, middle finger terminal phalanx","The phrase denotes the entire epiphysis of the terminal (distal) phalanx of the middle finger, without any additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps directly to 1003765005 because it conveys epiphysis, distal phalanx, middle finger, and completeness. Parent concepts omitting ‘entire’ or sibling concepts for different digits or non-epiphyseal parts would not match the exact specification."
103051007,Androstenediol (substance),Androstenediol entered on substance master list,"The mention of a master list signals cataloging of the chemical entity without clinical attributes or product details. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Substance category, specifically Androstenediol (substance) [SCTID: 103051007]. Parent classes would be less precise, and no child/sibling (such as isomeric or conjugated forms) is referenced, so the exact substance concept is appropriate."
408566000,Echocardiogram declined (situation),Consent withheld for echocardiogram.,"Withholding consent for the echocardiogram indicates the patient declined the procedure, which is the key situation. This is categorized as a Situation in SNOMED CT. The specific code is Echocardiogram declined (SCTID 408566000). A general consent-withheld concept would be too broad without specifying the procedure. Specifying modality such as TTE or TEE would add details not in the entry. The synonymic framing of refusal via consent status is clinically equivalent and does not alter the coding target."
773440003,Dermatological surgery care plan (record artifact),Dermatologic surgery care plan reviewed,"The main concept is a care plan for dermatologic surgery; review status is a documentation detail. As a Record artifact, it matches 773440003. It should not be mapped to a general care plan or to a clinical note type; the domain (dermatology) and scope (surgery) are integral to this concept. No specific procedure subtype is named, so child concepts are not indicated, and procedure codes are incorrect."
182230009,Structure of fourth tarsometatarsal joint (body structure),Exam area: fourth tarsometatarsal joint,"This documentation-style entry identifies the anatomical region of focus without adding attributes, still referring precisely to the fourth tarsometatarsal joint. It is a Body structure and maps to SNOMED CT 182230009. Parents such as 'tarsometatarsal joint' are overly broad, and siblings like 'fifth tarsometatarsal joint' are not indicated. No laterality or diagnostic findings are implied."
373941003,Left ventricular mass (finding),Left ventricular intracardiac mass,"The entry identifies an intracardiac mass localized to the left ventricle, describing the presence of a space-occupying lesion without further specification. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 373941003 (Left ventricular mass) precisely matches because it represents a mass within the left ventricle regardless of etiology. More general intracardiac mass concepts lack chamber specificity, and specifying thrombus or tumor would be inappropriate given the neutral wording. This phrase is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not introduce additional attributes or measurement concepts."
1137579001,Surgical staple remover (physical object),Staple extractor (surgical),"This entry uses the synonym 'extractor' and explicitly ties it to the surgical context, ensuring it refers to the staple-removing device. The main concept is a Physical object. SCTID 1137579001 is the exact match for a surgical staple remover. It avoids confusion with staplers or removal tools for other materials, and it lacks additional attributes (like skin-only or disposable) that would push toward a more specific child code."
723251002,Partial replacement of joint of left shoulder with prosthesis (procedure),Patient reports partial replacement of left shoulder joint with prosthesis,"This patient-reported statement conveys the occurrence of a partial replacement of the left shoulder joint using a prosthesis. The explicit attributes are laterality (left), site (shoulder joint), partial nature of the replacement, and device (prosthesis). Category: Procedure. Although expressed as a patient report, the underlying clinical concept remains the procedure itself, best coded as SCTID 723251002. A parent procedure encompassing total replacement would be less precise; siblings for total replacement are inconsistent with “partial.” Children specifying a particular component would be too narrow, as no component is stated."
268510008,Cardiac disease treatment started (situation),Initiation of treatment for cardiac disease documented,"This entry records the initiation of treatment for cardiac disease, avoiding specification of modality or disease subtype. The main concept is treatment initiation for cardiac disease; the SNOMED category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 268510008 is the precise code because it encodes 'Cardiac disease treatment started.' Parent concepts would be overly broad, and sibling concepts representing other statuses (e.g., planned, ongoing) are inconsistent with the documented initiation. The wording 'initiation ... documented' remains semantically equivalent to 'treatment started' and does not introduce new attributes."
411767006,Prunus persica diagnostic allergen extract (product),Prunus persica diagnostic allergy extract,"This phrase denotes an allergy-related extract from Prunus persica used diagnostically, corresponding to the diagnostic allergen product. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps precisely to SCTID 411767006. A parent concept of “diagnostic allergy extract” without species is too broad, and siblings like “Prunus persica therapeutic allergen extract” are excluded by the diagnostic qualifier. The wording does not introduce administration details or outcomes, ensuring an exact product identification."
722015006,Intensive care unit progress note (record artifact),ICU progress note document,"Adding the word 'document' reiterates that the artifact is a recorded note, not a clinical event, still specifying ICU context. The category is Record artifact. SCTID 722015006 best fits because it is the intensive care unit progress note. A more generic record artifact like clinical note or progress note without unit context would be less precise. Sibling ICU artifacts that are not progress notes (e.g., ICU admission note) would not match this wording. 'Document' is a harmless synonym emphasizing the artifact nature without changing the concept."
428191002,Percutaneous route (qualifier value),Route entry = percutaneous,"This succinct record-style note sets the route entry to percutaneous, corresponding to the Qualifier value Percutaneous route (428191002). The category is a route-of-administration qualifier and no additional clinical attributes are conveyed. It does not introduce topical or injection-related variants, so siblings are excluded. The explicit percutaneous wording makes the parent category too broad, confirming the correctness of 428191002."
223896009,Oxfordshire (geographic location),"Oxfordshire, GB","Using “GB” to denote Great Britain/United Kingdom as country context, the primary concept is still the county Oxfordshire, mapping to Oxfordshire (geographic location) SCTID 223896009. Category: Location. The country code context does not alter the concept to UK or England. Parent or sibling concepts would be either too broad or refer to different places; the county is the correct and most specific target."
213824004,"Train collision with rock, railway employee injured (event)",Clinician note: railway employee injured by train colliding with rock,"This clinician documentation specifies a train colliding with a rock and an injured railway employee, directly matching SCTID 213824004. Main concept: transport collision; attributes: train vs. rock, injured railway employee. SNOMED CT category: Event. Terms like “colliding” are synonymous with collision. Parent categories omitting either the collision object or the injured role are imprecise, and sibling codes with passengers or different collision objects are inconsistent with the entry."
702887001,Neurology clinic (environment),Neurology medical clinic,"This phrase specifies a medical clinic dedicated to neurology, clearly denoting the environment of care. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Environment or geographical location hierarchy and the best code is Neurology clinic (environment) SCTID 702887001. It does not introduce outpatient/inpatient qualifiers, referrals, or organizational structures. Broader clinic concepts lack specialty precision, and sibling concepts (e.g., Neurosurgery clinic, Neurology ward) are not consistent with the text, so 702887001 is the most precise match."
736249004,Radiotherapy care plan (record artifact),Radiotherapy plan of care,"This entry expresses a plan of care specifically for radiotherapy and indicates a documented artifact rather than an act of treatment. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It aligns with Radiotherapy care plan (record artifact) SCTID 736249004 by specifying modality-focused care planning without introducing intent, timing, or technical parameters. Using “plan of care” avoids confusion with the more technical Radiotherapy treatment plan, which would include dosimetry and field design. It is more specific than a general care plan and therefore the most precise match."
736287007,Hypothyroidism clinical management plan (record artifact),Problem-based plan: hypothyroidism,"The entry indicates a problem-oriented clinical management plan focused on hypothyroidism, representing a record artifact. The precise SNOMED CT concept is Hypothyroidism clinical management plan (record artifact) [736287007]. 'Problem-based plan' is a clinical phrasing for a management plan and does not add attributes. Parent concepts are not specific to hypothyroidism, and there is no mention of subtypes like subclinical or congenital hypothyroidism."
242165000,Accident to motorcycle during motor racing on rough ground (event),Patient statement: my motorcycle had an accident in an off-road race,"The patient-reported mechanism indicates a motorcycle accident in an off-road race; 'off-road' serves as a synonym for rough ground and 'race' conveys motor racing. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This maps to SCTID 242165000 because it captures the accident event to a motorcycle during motor racing on rough terrain, without adding details such as injuries, severity, or collision causes. General motorcycle accident concepts would be insufficiently specific."
66992004,Overhead and gantry crane site (environment),Overhead and gantry crane location,"The word 'location' here denotes the environment of an overhead and gantry crane site, not introducing any events or clinical modifiers. The main concept is the environmental location; the SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It matches Overhead and gantry crane site (environment) and is preferable to generic parents like industrial location or crane location unspecified. 'Location' is a neutral synonym for 'site' and preserves the intended concept scope."
19214009,Incision of spinal nerve root (procedure),Nursing note: assisting with spinal nerve root incision,"The nursing note describes assistance during a spinal nerve root incision. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure concerning the incision. The action being assisted is an incision of the spinal nerve root, which corresponds to SCTID 19214009, and the note does not add anatomical level, laterality, or other attributes. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings that imply different operative actions would be incorrect."
56262003,Structure of aponeurosis of biceps brachii muscle (body structure),Lacertus fibrosus (biceps aponeurosis),"This entry uses 'lacertus fibrosus,' the established anatomical synonym for the biceps brachii aponeurosis, with a clarifying parenthetical. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It most accurately maps to Structure of aponeurosis of biceps brachii muscle (56262003), since lacertus fibrosus denotes that exact aponeurosis. Using broader concepts like Aponeurosis of muscle or different tissues like Biceps tendon would be less precise. The synonym is standard and does not add attributes."
763076007,Environmental risk assessment declined (situation),Environmental risk assessment declined,"The entry explicitly states that an environmental risk assessment was declined, capturing a refusal of the specific assessment activity without adding timing, location, or reasons. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This maps precisely to Environmental risk assessment declined (763076007) because it identifies the exact assessment and the declination context. Broader parents like generic assessment declined would be too nonspecific, and siblings such as procedure not done due to refusal or consent not given introduce different situational semantics. No extra attributes are introduced."
568291000005106,Hospital unit (environment),In a hospital unit,"The prepositional phrase indicates presence within the specified environment, a hospital unit, which matches Hospital unit (environment) SCTID 568291000005106. The SNOMED category is Environment. This phrasing includes no details about unit type or function, avoiding inappropriate mapping to children like ICU or ED, and is narrower than the parent concept Hospital facility. It is a generic, precise reference to the unit environment."
127458004,Specimen from lung (specimen),A sample from the lung was sent,"This narrative indicates a specimen (sample) originating from the lung was submitted, without adding type or method. The concept is a Specimen with lung source, fitting SCTID 127458004. It avoids attributes that would trigger child codes (e.g., biopsy tissue, lavage fluid). Parent categories are too general, and siblings incorrect due to the explicit lung origin."
16215291000119109,Specimen from right lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchial washing procedure (specimen),Right lower lobe bronchial washing specimen—RLL label,"This notes a specimen from a bronchial washing with the anatomical source as the right lower lobe, and mentions the label as RLL, reinforcing the site. The main concept is Specimen; attributes are site (right lower lobe of lung) and method (bronchial washing). Category: Specimen. SCTID 16215291000119109 is the most precise code. General parent terms without site specificity or siblings with different lobes or BAL are less suitable. The mention of a label is logistical and does not alter the clinical attributes relevant to coding."
702889003,Neurophysiology clinic (environment),Services provided in the neurophysiology clinic,"The wording identifies the location where services occur as the neurophysiology clinic, focusing on the environment rather than the services themselves. The SNOMED category is Environment. It aligns most precisely with Neurophysiology clinic (environment) SCTID 702889003, rather than generic clinic environments or different specialty settings. No additional attributes alter the environmental focus."
258614005,Insect specimen (specimen),Insect specimen for testing,"This notes an insect specimen with general intent for testing, without specifying test type or attributes like species or life stage. The main concept is an insect-based specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The best match is 258614005 (Insect specimen), rather than a parent such as 'Arthropod specimen' or a child like 'Mosquito specimen'. The mention of testing is generic and does not alter the specimen code selection."
836338008,6/60 pinhole visual acuity of right eye (finding),Pinhole VA of right eye 6/60,"This phrase records a pinhole visual acuity for the right eye with a Snellen metric result of 6/60. It includes the attributes of laterality and method. The category is Clinical finding. The SNOMED concept 836338008 precisely matches because it encodes pinhole visual acuity, right eye, at 6/60. Using a parent like 'right eye pinhole visual acuity' would omit the numeric value, and a sibling like '6/60 right eye visual acuity' would omit the pinhole method; different laterality or value would be incorrect."
762045008,Structure of shaft of third metacarpal bone of left hand (body structure),Left hand 3rd metacarpal bone shaft,"The entry denotes the shaft portion of the third metacarpal bone in the left hand, with clear laterality and part specification. It represents a Body structure mapping precisely to Structure of shaft of third metacarpal bone of left hand (762045008). Parent concepts for the entire bone or unspecified shafts are less precise, and siblings for head/base or other metacarpals would be incorrect. No extra clinical attributes are introduced by the wording."
486261000119109,"Plain X-ray of chest, posteroanterior (procedure)",PA chest X-ray,"The entry denotes a plain radiographic exam of the chest using a posteroanterior (PA) projection. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This precisely matches the concept Plain X-ray of chest, posteroanterior (SCTID 486261000119109) because it specifies both the anatomic region (chest) and the projection (PA) for a non-contrast standard X-ray. More general parent concepts such as plain chest X-ray without projection are less specific, and sibling concepts such as AP or lateral chest X-rays are incorrect given the explicit PA projection. The abbreviation “X-ray” and “PA” are standard clinical shorthand for a plain radiograph and the posteroanterior view, respectively, without introducing additional attributes."
388577005,Cicer arietinus specific immunoglobulin E antibody measurement (procedure),Chickpea sIgE test performed,"This indicates performance of a test measuring specific immunoglobulin E to chickpea (Cicer arietinus), clearly a procedural laboratory measurement. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 388577005 is the correct code since it is the sIgE measurement for Cicer arietinus. Generic parents are too broad, and siblings like peanut or lentil sIgE, or skin tests, are not appropriate. The abbreviation “sIgE” is a standard synonym for specific IgE and introduces no additional attributes."
365428008,Finding of semen volume (finding),Semen volume observation recorded,"The phrase describes that an observation pertaining to semen volume has been recorded, which aligns with a documented Clinical finding and maps to 'Finding of semen volume' (365428008). No abnormality, numeric data, or associated causes are stated, preventing misclassification to more specific children. 'Observation' here is used as a clinical documentation term; it does not indicate an observable entity code, and it is more specific than a generic semen finding by focusing on volume."
292761000119102,Tardy left ulnar nerve palsy (finding),Left-sided tardy ulnar nerve palsy,"The entry specifies a tardy ulnar nerve palsy on the left side. Category: Clinical finding. 'Left-sided' unambiguously indicates left laterality and 'tardy' preserves delayed onset, making this a precise match. Broader or different codes (unspecified laterality, non-tardy, or right-sided) are less appropriate. No additional attributes (e.g., entrapment location or etiology) are introduced."
224693005,Separate eating room (environment),Standalone eating room,"This entry denotes an environment: a room meant for eating that stands alone/separate from other spaces. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. 'Standalone' here functions as a synonym for 'separate' without adding new attributes, keeping the concept aligned with SCTID 224693005. More general parents omit the separation property, and area-based siblings would not represent a room."
282350005,milliinternational unit per unit volume (qualifier value),Measurement unit mIU per unit volume,"This entry indicates the measurement unit and names it as mIU per unit volume, meaning milli-international unit per unit volume. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It correctly maps to SCTID 282350005 because the unit is expressed with a generic volume denominator, avoiding specific denominators like milliliter or liter. Sibling units like IU per unit volume would differ in numerator magnitude, and child units with specified denominators would be too narrow. The contextual word 'Measurement' does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
174030005,Gastrocnemius recession (procedure),Surgical note: gastrocnemius recession was done,"The note documents completion of gastrocnemius recession, a Procedure. It maps to SCTID 174030005. Parent-level categories (muscle surgery) lack the specific muscle targeted, and related procedures like Achilles tendon lengthening or soleus recession are not what was performed. There are no added qualifiers (technique, side, indication), so the generic gastrocnemius recession code is the most precise match."
256856002,Limberg flap (substance),Chart documentation: Limberg rhomboid flap,"The chart context is incidental; the term denotes the specific flap tissue, Limberg (rhomboid). The main concept is the substance. This maps to the SNOMED CT Substance category with SCTID 256856002. Including 'rhomboid' is a synonymic descriptor of the Limberg design and does not alter the coded concept. More generic rhomboid flap substances or procedural reconstruction codes would be less precise and not aligned with the wording focused on the material."
309205005,Cholecystectomy specimen (specimen),Patient statement: cholecystectomy specimen went to pathology,"A patient-reported context indicates that a specimen from the cholecystectomy was sent to pathology, which still denotes the existence of a cholecystectomy specimen and maps to SCTID 309205005. Main concept: specimen originating from cholecystectomy. Category: Specimen. The sending-to-pathology detail is workflow context only. Broader or organ-only concepts would be less exact than explicitly tying the specimen to cholecystectomy."
23666003,Phoxinus eos (organism),Scientific name recorded—Phoxinus eos,"This documentation phrasing records the scientific name Phoxinus eos, which is the species-level organism concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No clinical attributes like cause or severity are added; the focus is strictly the taxon. Parent concepts like 'Phoxinus' or 'Fish' are too broad, and sibling species do not match the stated name. Thus, SCTID 23666003 is the correct selection."
765051008,Aid prescription record (record artifact),Aid prescription record in patient portal,"This phrase identifies a record artifact documenting an aid prescription and indicates its presence in the patient portal, without altering the underlying concept. The main concept is a Record artifact, mapping to SCTID 765051008. It does not denote the act of prescribing or a specific device, making procedure or physical object concepts inappropriate, and it is more specific than a generic “prescription record” parent because of the explicit aid focus. No new clinical attributes are introduced by the location context."
411218005,Isocyanate series (product),Isocyanate series supplied,"The entry states that the product 'Isocyanate series' was supplied, keeping the focus on the product itself. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 411218005 is the precise code because the item supplied is the named series; there is no implication of a test, result, or a different product. Parent-level chemical products or sibling series concepts would be less specific, and single isocyanates are not implied. Supply context does not introduce clinical attributes that would alter coding."
258651004,Cream specimen (specimen),Specimen: cream (lab),"This entry states the specimen is cream and optionally notes lab context, which does not alter the specimen type. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 258651004 Cream specimen matches exactly because it denotes a specimen consisting of cream. Using 'lab' is contextual and not an attribute that changes coding. Parent concepts lack specificity; siblings (ointment, lotion) do not match the explicit 'cream' wording."
329514008,Kelp+garlic product (product),Patient-reported item: kelp and garlic product,"This entry captures the product as reported by the patient, with the concept being a product containing kelp and garlic, aligning with Kelp+garlic product (product), SCTID 329514008. Main concept: dual-ingredient product; “patient-reported item” is contextual metadata, not an attribute of the product itself. SNOMED CT category: Product. It avoids mapping to unrelated parents like generic supplements and does not stray into child concepts with formulation/strength. The phrase remains semantically equivalent to the preferred concept."
310601008,Report to Drug Safety Research Unit (record artifact),DSRU report submitted,"This phrase denotes that a report to the Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) has been submitted, emphasizing the existence of the documented report artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The concept SCTID 310601008 is appropriate because it represents the record of a report to DSRU. Using a broader parent like 'Report (record artifact)' lacks the specified recipient, and a sibling such as 'Letter to Drug Safety Research Unit (record artifact)' would incorrectly imply a specific format. 'Submitted' is a synonym conveying completion of the report, without adding extraneous attributes, keeping it equivalent to the base concept."
115451000119100,History of endophthalmitis (situation),Patient reports prior endophthalmitis,"This documentation reflects patient-reported past occurrence of endophthalmitis, setting an explicit historical context. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation with explicit context and maps to History of endophthalmitis (115451000119100). The statement does not indicate the condition is present now, so using the disorder concept would miscode. It avoids added attributes like cause, laterality, or recurrence, and it clearly refers to the patient’s own history, so family history is excluded."
257718002,Tidal waterway (environment),Waterway subject to tides,"This paraphrase defines the environment as a waterway that is subject to tidal influence, which is semantically equivalent to 'tidal waterway' and maps to SCTID 257718002. Only the environmental concept is expressed, without additional qualifiers. The category is Environment. A generic 'waterway' code would be too broad, and more specific types (e.g., 'tidal creek' or 'estuary') are not indicated; thus, the tidal waterway concept is the correct match."
80840006,"Fragmentation bomb, device (physical object)",Fragmentation bomb hardware (device),"Using ‘hardware’ in conjunction with ‘device’ retains the physical object identity of a fragmentation bomb. Category: Physical object (device). The fragmentation subtype ensures precision to SCTID 80840006; general bomb hardware or other ordnance would be too broad. The phrasing does not introduce attributes like status or use, making it a clinically equivalent synonym for the device concept."
363206008,Computed tomography special views and positions (procedure),CT with special views and positions,"The entry denotes a computed tomography procedure explicitly performed with special views and patient positions. The main concept is a CT exam characterized by nonstandard views/positioning, without specifying body site, contrast, or timing. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 363206008, “Computed tomography special views and positions (procedure),” is the most precise match because it captures CT performed using specialized positioning/view techniques. Using the parent “Computed tomography (procedure)” would omit the special views/positions attribute, and any child or sibling specifying a body region, contrast use, or named position would be too specific. “Special views and positions” is a clinically equivalent phrasing of the concept label and does not add other attributes."
1279527000,Surgical margin involved by high grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia in excised specimen of pancreas (observable entity),High-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia at the surgical margin of the pancreatic specimen.,"By stating the presence of high-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia at the surgical margin in a pancreatic specimen, the entry conveys margin involvement. This is an Observable entity specifying both lesion type and organ specimen, aligning with SCTID 1279527000. Parent/sibling concepts that omit the lesion or organ, or that substitute carcinoma/low-grade lesions, would not be as precise. 'At the surgical margin' is synonymous with margin involvement in pathology usage."
1186603001,Revision of fusion of joint of spine with internal fixation of bone of spine (procedure),"Revision of spinal arthrodesis, internal fixation applied","The entry denotes a revision of a spinal fusion (arthrodesis) and states that internal fixation is applied, which matches SNOMED CT 1186603001. The category is Procedure. It is more specific than the parent revision concept by including fixation and avoids over-specifying details like level or approach. 'Arthrodesis' is a direct synonym for fusion, and 'internal fixation applied' is equivalent to instrumentation without altering the intended code."
257660009,Police cell (environment),Cell — police custody area,"This wording designates a cell located in the police custody area, i.e., a police cell. The category is Environment or geographical location. It excludes courthouse or prison custody areas and adds no clinical or event attributes. Accordingly, Police cell (environment), SCTID 257660009, is the precise and correct code."
465123006,Vagus nerve electrical stimulation system lead (physical object),VNS system lead component,"The wording specifies the lead component within a VNS system, and it avoids attributes like implantation status, laterality, or malfunction. It is a Physical object in SNOMED CT. The correct concept is 465123006 (Vagus nerve electrical stimulation system lead), as it captures the device-part precisely. Parent concepts are overly broad, while siblings like the generator or electrodes are different device elements. The phrase focuses on the object, not a clinical finding or an intervention."
10997571000119105,History of removal of left breast implant (situation),Hx: left breast implant removal,"This shorthand indicates past history (Hx) of removal of a breast implant on the left side. The explicit attributes are past context and laterality (left). Category: Situation with explicit context. The phrasing aligns with SNOMED CT 10997571000119105 by documenting historical removal of the left breast implant. More general parent concepts without laterality are less precise. Procedure concepts (current removal) and findings (implant absence) are not appropriate because the statement is about historical removal, not a present procedure or status. 'Removal' here is clinically equivalent to 'explantation' and does not change code selection."
371525003,Clinical procedure report (record artifact),Clinical procedure report referenced in follow-up documentation,"This entry indicates that a clinical procedure report is referenced in follow-up notes, but the concept remains the record artifact itself. No attributes such as type of procedure, timing, or outcomes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the most accurate mapping is Clinical procedure report (record artifact) [371525003]. Using parent ""report"" concepts would be too broad, while choosing child/sibling types (e.g., Operative report, Endoscopy report) would be too specific. The contextual mention of follow-up does not alter the artifact identity or code."
242354000,Accidental ingestion of toxic fungal species (event),Accidental ingestion of poisonous mushroom(s),"This entry describes accidental ingestion and identifies the agent as poisonous mushrooms, a clinically equivalent term to toxic fungal species. SNOMED CT category: Event. It is the most accurate match to Accidental ingestion of toxic fungal species (event), SCTID 242354000. Parents are too broad, and disorder-level poisoning is not indicated. The pluralization option '(s)' does not change the core concept and adds no extra attributes."
373942005,Discharge summary (record artifact),Discharge summary chart entry,"Calling it a 'chart entry' frames the discharge summary as an entry within the medical record, still representing the same artifact. Main concept: discharge summary; SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This maps to 373942005 and is more specific than general chart entries. It avoids sibling artifacts such as instruction sheets and does not introduce attributes like timing or setting beyond the inherent discharge context."
183214006,Ileostomy bag changed (finding),Ileostomy bag exchanged,"The entry confirms that the ileostomy bag was exchanged, which is synonymous with changed in this context, without additional details. This is a Clinical finding, aligning with 183214006 Ileostomy bag changed (finding). Parent concepts describing generic ostomy/stoma bag changes lack the ileostomy specificity, and sibling concepts for other types of stomas are inaccurate. The term 'exchanged' does not introduce new attributes and is equivalent to 'changed.'"
78000005,Structure of right hepatic duct (body structure),Radiology label: right hepatic duct,"Here the right hepatic duct is the labeled anatomical entity on imaging, with no additional attributes provided. The category is Body structure. Using a parent ('hepatic duct') would lose the right-sided specificity, and using siblings ('left hepatic duct', 'common hepatic duct') would misidentify the duct. No substructures are referenced. Thus, the entry matches SNOMED CT concept 78000005 precisely."
223918005,Counties of Northern Ireland (geographic location),County areas of Northern Ireland,"The phrase 'county areas' is a clinically safe paraphrase for the counties themselves in a geographic context. It conveys a location concept only. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. This maps to 223918005, the plural counties set, rather than to the parent Northern Ireland, a singular county child, or sibling subdivisions (e.g., districts). The synonym does not change semantics and keeps the focus on the county-level grouping within Northern Ireland."
422625006,History of present illness section (record artifact),Telemedicine note — HPI section,"The entry refers to the HPI section within a telemedicine note and remains a pure reference to the section artifact. The concept falls under Record artifact and contains no added clinical details. It maps to SNOMED CT History of present illness section (record artifact) [422625006]. Parent concepts like generic document sections are overly broad, while siblings such as ‘Chief complaint section’ or ‘Review of systems section’ do not match the label. The telemedicine context does not change the identity of the section; ‘HPI’ is a standard synonym for the same concept."
10231006,Bushy-tailed giant rat (organism),Animal identified: bushy-tailed giant rat,"The phrase indicates identification of an animal and names the species, but does not add clinical attributes such as exposure, injury, or infection. The target concept is the organism Bushy-tailed giant rat, which sits in the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy. Parent/general rat concepts would be insufficiently specific, and other rat species would be siblings. Hence, SCTID 10231006 is the most precise match."
77549006,Product containing terpene (product),Discharge summary: terpene formulation,"As documented in a discharge summary, ‘terpene formulation’ refers to a product formulated with terpene. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The best match remains SCTID 77549006. Mapping to a substance is inappropriate, and mapping to more specific combination products or named terpene variants would over-specify. The context prefix is non-semantic regarding the coded product and does not change code selection."
309934006,Infectious diseases department (environment),Patient-reported place: “Infectious Diseases department”,"A patient statement identifies the place as the infectious diseases department, referring to the same environment. Category: Environment or geographical location. The precise code is Infectious diseases department (environment) 309934006. Mapping to visit or referral actions would be less accurate because the core concept remains the department as a location. Sibling concepts like clinic or ward are not indicated, and no additional attributes are specified."
1365864006,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror of mandible with mouth open (record artifact),Dental chart: intraoral mandibular photo taken via mirror with the mouth open,"The entry documents a dental record artifact: an intraoral photo of the mandible captured via mirror, with mouth open. The stated attributes match the concept—photographic intraoral modality, mandibular site, mirror method, open mouth. This belongs to the Record artifact category in SNOMED CT, not a finding. SCTID 1365864006 precisely represents this combination. A broader parent (intraoral photo without specifying mirror/open mouth) or a sibling (maxillary image or direct non-mirror view) would not be as accurate. 'Via mirror' is a synonymous phrasing for 'viewed through mirror' and maintains code equivalence."
411308002,Caine mix IV (product),Caine mix IV referenced by patient,"This patient-context phrase still centers on the product “Caine mix IV,” with IV as the Roman numeral variant identifier. It introduces no dose, route, or indication, keeping the focus on the product name. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It precisely matches SCTID 411308002. Selecting a parent or sibling concept would lose the specific IV variant reference. The context of patient mention does not change the underlying concept."
74632002,Product containing succinimide (product),Drug product containing succinimide,"This indicates a drug product whose ingredient is succinimide, with no formulation or dosing attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 74632002 is the correct code because it identifies products that contain succinimide. A pure substance concept would not capture the product nature, and children specifying particular dose forms or strengths would be over-specific. 'Drug product' is a clinically acceptable synonym for medicinal/pharmaceutical product and does not add attributes beyond the ingredient."
110935005,Testis cytologic material (specimen),Cytology specimen derived from testis,"This reflects a specimen for cytologic analysis derived from the testis, indicating source and material type consistent with the Specimen concept. It corresponds directly to testis cytologic material (110935005). Parent concepts without anatomic specificity are too broad, and siblings like histologic testis specimen are incorrect material types. No method or laterality is introduced."
289395002,Fetal hand palpable vaginally (finding),PV exam confirms fetal hand palpable,"“PV exam” (per vaginam) is a common clinical abbreviation; the finding is the palpable fetal hand. Category: Clinical finding. The synonym choices do not change the clinical meaning: palpation through the vagina of the fetal hand. This exactly fits SCTID 289395002. A parent concept would lack the specificity for hand, and sibling concepts for other limbs or presentation/prolapse are not supported by the text."
1156860005,Rapid antigen detection immunoassay technique (qualifier value),Rapid antigen detection immunoassay analytical technique,"By explicitly stating ‘analytical technique’ alongside ‘rapid antigen detection immunoassay,’ the entry unambiguously points to the method qualifier. This is a Qualifier value and maps to SCTID 1156860005. Parent technique concepts are overly broad, while specific subtypes or procedure codes would not match the general technique phrasing used. The synonymy between ‘analytical technique’ and ‘technique’ is standard and does not introduce new attributes."
24291000087104,Geriatric chronic pain management service (qualifier value),Under geriatric chronic pain management service,"This entry indicates the context of care being under a specific service, namely the geriatric chronic pain management service. The category is Qualifier value, mapping to Geriatric chronic pain management service (SCTID: 24291000087104). It does not denote a referral, visit, or program and remains a qualifier for service type. Parent concepts without geriatric scope or without 'chronic pain' would be insufficiently specific, making this exact concept the most precise match."
736006005,Carvedilol contraindicated (situation),Carvedilol contraindicated status documented.,"The wording denotes the documentation of a contraindication status for carvedilol, which fits the Situation concept Carvedilol contraindicated (736006005). It avoids introducing cause, timing, or severity. General or class-based parent concepts would be less specific, and allergy/intolerance concepts would misrepresent the clinical state. The term ‘status documented’ is a documentation-style synonym that maintains coding equivalence."
1303595003,Arthroscopy of right knee joint (procedure),Right knee joint arthroscopy completed,"This statement indicates completion of an arthroscopy on the right knee joint, identifying the method, site, and laterality with no added attributes. It is a Procedure. The appropriate code is Arthroscopy of right knee joint (SCTID: 1303595003). Parent concepts are too general without laterality, and siblings such as left-sided arthroscopy or specific diagnostic/therapeutic variants are not supported by the wording. The word 'completed' does not introduce new clinical attributes beyond occurrence."
401319005,Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale: anxiety score (observable entity),Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety score entry,"This references the label/name of the HADS anxiety score within documentation, still denoting the underlying observable entity. It aligns with SNOMED CT Observable entity 401319005. The phrase does not introduce a measured value, timing, or interpretation, avoiding findings or procedural mappings. It distinguishes from sibling depression or total score entries by specifying anxiety."
223849001,Menorca (geographic location),Place: Menorca,"“Place: Menorca” states Menorca as the place, with the label simply indicating context. The main concept is Menorca as a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Location. The precise code is Menorca (geographic location) SCTID 223849001. Parent or sibling concepts are not better matches, and there is no child locality specified. The phrasing does not add attributes beyond naming the location."
246581004,Peripheral reflex (observable entity),Peripheral reflex tested (result not provided),"This conveys that the peripheral reflex observable was the focus of testing, but no result is given. It should be coded to SNOMED CT 246581004 (Observable entity), since the concept described is the reflex observable itself. Parent reflex is too broad, and child-level specific reflexes are not identified; there is no added attribute beyond referencing the observable."
397623002,Ability to sense pressure (observable entity),Ability to experience pressure,"Here, 'experience' functions as a clinical synonym for perceiving or sensing a pressure stimulus, emphasizing the observable capacity without assigning status or context like location or threshold. The Observable entity 'Ability to sense pressure' (SNOMED CT 397623002) best fits. A parent concept like general sensory experience is too broad, while siblings (pain experience, temperature experience) are different modalities. The entry avoids any attributes that would indicate a specific test, site, or abnormality, keeping the mapping at the correct level."
773982006,Rheumatology care plan (record artifact),Rheumatology care plan noted,"The phrase indicates acknowledgement of a rheumatology care plan in the record, identifying a care plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It matches Rheumatology care plan (SCTID 773982006); 'noted' is contextual documentation language and does not alter the underlying artifact. A generic care plan parent lacks specialty specificity, and sibling artifacts like progress notes or summaries are not stated."
440565004,Not fasting (situation),Patient reports not fasting,"A patient-reported statement that they are not fasting. This remains a Situation reflecting the patient’s fasting status. “Not fasting (situation)” [440565004] precisely captures the state without implying cause or procedure. General fasting status concepts would be less specific, and siblings like “Fasting” would be contradictory. The source (patient) does not change the coded concept."
214599000,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving injury by being thrown against some part of, or object in, motor vehicle while in motion, pedal cyclist injured (event)",Report: Pedal cyclist injured in noncollision motor-vehicle traffic accident—thrown against object in the vehicle during motion.,"This report-style entry identifies a pedal cyclist injured in a noncollision motor-vehicle traffic accident, with the mechanism of being thrown against an object in the vehicle while it was moving. The concept is an Event. It is a precise fit for SCTID 214599000, as it encompasses noncollision, traffic context, motor vehicle, interior object impact, motion, and the injured party category. Parent concepts are less specific, and siblings concerning collision or different mechanisms (e.g., ejected) would not apply. The phrasing is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
439215002,Closed reduction of fracture of medial epicondyle of humerus (procedure),Discharge: closed reduction completed for humeral medial epicondyle fracture,"This discharge line documents completion of a closed reduction for a fracture of the humeral medial epicondyle. The main concept is the procedure of closed reduction with the site precisely defined, fitting SNOMED CT 439215002. Broader or sibling concepts that change approach (open) or add fixation are not appropriate. The discharge context does not alter the underlying procedure; it is still the same coded action."
1301000119100,History of primary malignant neoplasm of testis (situation),Indication: history of primary testicular cancer,"As a clinical indication, this labels the reason for evaluation as a past history of primary testicular cancer, clearly distinguishing historical context and primary site. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 1301000119100 is the precise mapping. Using a broader ‘history of cancer’ code would sacrifice site specificity, and sibling concepts like secondary/testicular metastasis or family history are not supported. ‘Cancer’ is an accepted synonym for malignant neoplasm."
256367009,Leukocyte buffy coat - CMV negative (product),CMV nonreactive leukocyte buffy coat,"This wording uses 'CMV nonreactive' as a synonymous interpretation of CMV negative for blood products and specifies the component as leukocyte buffy coat. It is a Product concept matching SCTID 256367009. Parent concepts omit the CMV-negative detail, while siblings with other components or additional processing are not appropriate. 'Nonreactive' does not change the intended attribute—it indicates a negative CMV result."
110910004,Lung cytologic material (specimen),Cytologic material obtained from lung,"This declares that the specimen is cytologic material and the source is the lung. Attributes: specimen type (cytologic) and anatomical site (lung); no technique, laterality, or timing. Category: Specimen. Best-coded to SCTID 110910004. Parents like 'Cytologic material (specimen)' lack site specification; technique-specific siblings are not indicated."
217727002,Accident caused by flood arising from remote storm (event),Accident stemming from flooding caused by a storm in another region,"This entry conveys an accident event stemming from flooding, with the flood caused by a storm in another region (remote). It is an Event concept. 'Storm in another region' is a clinically equivalent way to state 'remote storm,' thereby justifying SCTID 217727002. Parent 'Accident due to flood' without storm detail or non-remote storm variants would be less precise. No extra attributes like location specifics beyond remoteness are added."
16216011000119104,Hilum of lung specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure (specimen),"Fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimen, lung hilum","This entry clearly states a specimen obtained via fine needle aspiration and specifies the site as the lung hilum, establishing it as a Specimen with defined method and location. It corresponds exactly to 'Hilum of lung specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure.' Parent concepts that do not include both elements are less exact, and sibling concepts with alternative sites or techniques would be inappropriate. The use of 'FNA' as an abbreviation does not change the clinical meaning or code selection."
391531005,Blood (white blood cell) screen for infantile neuronal lipofuscinosis (procedure),Follow-up: reviewed leukocyte screen for infantile neuronal lipofuscinosis (blood) performed previously,"This follow-up note references a previously performed blood leukocyte screening for infantile neuronal lipofuscinosis, focusing on the procedure without stating outcomes. The main concept is the prior WBC screening for INCL. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The entry aligns with 391531005 since it identifies a screen on blood leukocytes targeting INCL; it does not add attributes like results or method. Parent or sibling concepts would either be generic screening without WBC detail or specify different methodologies or specimens, which are not indicated here."
284597008,Over-affectionate (finding),Parent notes the child is overly affectionate,"This caregiver statement expresses the finding of excessive affection in the child without adding attributes such as target or cause, aligning with Over-affectionate (finding), SCTID 284597008, Clinical finding. Parent concepts are nonspecific, and sibling concepts such as affectionate behavior (normal) or general disinhibition differ in scope. The synonym 'overly affectionate' is clinically equivalent to 'over-affectionate,' preserving code selection."
305052000,Structure of articular cartilage of triquetrum (body structure),Triquetrum articular cartilage (anatomy),"Adding “(anatomy)” clarifies context without changing meaning: the articular cartilage associated with the triquetrum’s joint surfaces. This is a Body structure and matches SNOMED CT 305052000. Broader anatomical parents or sibling structures (other carpals) would be less precise, and there is no implication of a specific triquetral articulation that would suggest a child concept."
416407007,Skin and/or subcutaneous tissue structure of dorsum of foot (body structure),Documentation: skin and/or subcutaneous tissue of dorsum of foot,"This entry uses the exact wording 'skin and/or subcutaneous tissue' and localizes it to the dorsum of the foot, making it an exact lexical match to 'Skin and/or subcutaneous tissue structure of dorsum of foot' (SCTID 416407007). The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. No additional attributes are present. Using a parent foot site without dorsal specification would be less precise, and child concepts restricted to only skin or only subcutaneous tissue on the dorsum would be narrower than intended. The context label 'Documentation' does not affect code choice."
15564007,"Slow axoplasmic transport, function (observable entity)",Research study finding: slow axoplasmic transport function,"The entry reports a research finding of slow axoplasmic transport as a functional observable, mapping to SNOMED CT 15564007 (Observable entity). It specifies the 'slow' function without adding other attributes. The generic parent 'axoplasmic transport function' lacks the specificity, and sibling fast transport concepts would be incorrect. The research context does not alter the code selection for the observable."
728298008,Entire mesorectum (body structure),Complete mesorectum,"The term “complete” specifies the full extent of the mesorectum, pointing to the entire structure rather than a portion. This is an anatomical Body structure entry, and it aligns directly with “Entire mesorectum (body structure)” SCTID 728298008. A more general parent concept “Mesorectum” would omit the completeness implied by “complete,” and other related structures (e.g., mesorectal fat, fascia) are not referenced, making those child or sibling concepts inappropriate."
257644005,Mountain (environment),Mountain-based setting,"The phrase describes a setting based on a mountain environment, without specifying altitude, named mountain, or events. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. 'Mountain-based' remains semantically equivalent to Mountain (environment) [257644005]. Parent concepts are overly broad, and siblings such as mountain range, hill, or alpine region change the landform or add scope/attributes not expressed. Thus, the mountain environment code is the most appropriate."
366641006,Finding of range eversion of subtalar joint (finding),Follow-up: review of subtalar joint eversion range finding,"This entry conveys that a follow-up review pertains to a clinical finding on the eversion range of the subtalar joint, with no attributes such as normality, limitation, or lateralization. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, making SCTID 366641006 the appropriate code. Broader ROM findings or sibling concepts (e.g., inversion or ankle ROM) do not match the specific eversion movement of the subtalar joint, and child concepts with abnormal range are not indicated here. The follow-up context does not change the underlying finding."
1184596005,Past pregnancy document section (record artifact),"Patient portal section labeled ""Past pregnancy""","This entry references the patient-facing record section labeled for past pregnancies, which remains a document section. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps to SCTID 1184596005 because it identifies a section dedicated to past pregnancy content. Parent concepts such as general portal section are too broad, and siblings like current pregnancy portal sections would not match the past focus. The wording introduces only the labeling and context (patient portal), not any clinical details or actions, preserving precise coding."
310109006,Orthotics service (qualifier value),Referring service: orthotics,"As a report field, this uses ‘orthotics’ to specify the referring service, appropriately invoking the orthotics service qualifier. The correct code is SNOMED CT 310109006 Orthotics service (qualifier value). No procedural action, device issuance, or encounter type is asserted beyond the service identification. Parent/general service concepts are less precise, and sibling services differ. Category: Qualifier value."
5739006,Stramonium (substance),Active ingredient: Stramonium,"The entry names Stramonium specifically as an active ingredient, which still refers to the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Mentioning 'active ingredient' does not convert this to a medicinal product concept; it simply contextualizes the substance role. More general or product-level concepts are not as precise, and disorder or exposure concepts are not implicated. Therefore, Stramonium (substance) SCTID 5739006 is the correct selection."
423544001,Goat adenovirus (organism),Goat adenovirus listed in virology panel,"The entry mentions the organism by name in the context of a panel listing but does not indicate detection, positivity, or clinical findings. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The organism concept 423544001 (Goat adenovirus) is the precise match because the text names the specific caprine adenovirus. A parent adenovirus concept would be too general, and any sibling for other species is not supported by the wording. The panel listing context does not alter the organism identification."
303836002,Structure of evertor of intertarsal joint (body structure),Dissection note: evertor of intertarsal joint structure,"In dissection context, the term still references the anatomical evertor of the intertarsal joint, mapping precisely to SNOMED CT 303836002. The category is Body structure. The phrase does not introduce findings or other attributes. Parent categories lack functional specificity, while child concepts would identify individual muscles or parts. Sibling structures describing other actions (like invertors) are not the same anatomical functional class."
708112008,Fluid specimen from rectouterine pouch obtained by aspiration (specimen),Specimen — aspirated rectouterine pouch fluid,"The text declares a specimen consisting of fluid aspirated from the rectouterine pouch, covering all necessary attributes: site, material, and method. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This matches the target concept exactly and avoids mapping to parents that lack the aspiration method or broader locations. Sibling concepts that reflect procedures or other acquisition modalities would be incorrect. “Aspirated” equates to “obtained by aspiration,” preserving coding precision."
48091006,Prolonged sleep (finding),Prolonged sleeping,"The phrase ""Prolonged sleeping"" conveys the same meaning as prolonged sleep, focusing on the duration aspect without introducing a cause or specific timeframe. The main concept is prolonged sleep, with no additional modifiers. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT. SCTID 48091006 is the most accurate code, as it directly represents the finding of extended sleep. Alternatives such as somnolence or hypersomnia would incorrectly imply sleepiness or a disorder rather than duration, and parent categories would be less specific."
700253008,Suspected victim of sexual grooming (situation),Problem list: suspected victim of sexual grooming,"The entry frames the suspected status within a problem list context, with no additional attributes added. This is a SNOMED Situation representing suspected victimization tied to sexual grooming. It precisely matches 700253008 since the concept is the person being a suspected grooming victim. A confirmed grooming victim code or a code for suspected sexual abuse broadly would be less precise."
105085005,Benzthiazide measurement (procedure),Quantification of benzthiazide,"Quantification is a synonym for measurement of the analyte, here benzthiazide, constituting a Procedure. The entry matches 'Benzthiazide measurement (procedure)' precisely by naming the specific drug and the action of measuring it. No additional attributes are introduced, so child concepts (specimen-specific) or method-defined procedures are not implied."
225736003,Massage parlour (environment),Recorded location: massage parlour,"The entry captures the location as 'massage parlour' and remains focused solely on the environment. Category: Environment or geographical location. It would be inappropriate to use a broader location or a healthcare facility concept; 'massage parlour' is neither a hospital nor a clinic. Therefore, the precise match is SNOMED CT 225736003."
215837004,"Crushed by falling object on ship or while loading or unloading, swimmer injured (event)",Swimmer injured due to crushing by falling object aboard ship,"The phrase identifies the injured party (swimmer), the mechanism (crushing by falling object), and the setting (aboard ship), which matches SCTID 215837004. As an Event, it is more specific than parent categories that do not detail both mechanism and victim type. It excludes siblings that concern different victims (crew) or contexts. “Aboard ship” is a synonymous expression for “on ship” and does not change the intended code."
709887002,Antibody to Leishmania chagasi K39 (substance),Antibody directed at Leishmania chagasi K39,"This entry denotes an antibody directed at the K39 antigen of Leishmania chagasi, a substance. It does not specify isotype, assay results, or other attributes. The precise SNOMED CT concept is “Antibody to Leishmania chagasi K39” (709887002). Broader parents omit K39, reducing specificity, and siblings targeting a different epitope or species would misrepresent the target. The verb “directed at” is a common synonymic description of antibody specificity and does not affect coding."
214360009,"Motor vehicle traffic accident due to motor vehicle going out of control due to blowout, without collision on the highway, passenger on motor cycle injured (event)",Highway non-collision motor vehicle traffic accident from blowout-induced loss of control; injured party is a motorcycle passenger.,"The entry captures a road traffic accident on the highway, specifying a blowout that caused a vehicle (motorcycle) to go out of control, explicitly non-collision, and the patient as a motorcycle passenger. This maps to SNOMED CT Event SCTID 214360009, which requires the combination of traffic accident, blowout leading to loss of control, no collision, highway location, and motorcycle passenger injured. Broader or sibling concepts (e.g., collision events, nontraffic incidents, unspecified occupant) would not reflect the detailed attributes provided. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term without introducing additional features."
442850001,Streptococcus pyogenes type emm51 (organism),Database record: Streptococcus pyogenes emm51,A database record specifying Streptococcus pyogenes with emm51 precisely matches the organism concept Streptococcus pyogenes type emm51. The category is Organism. Including emm51 differentiates this from the parent species-only code and ensures it is not any other emm sibling. No additional attributes such as infection status or site are implied; it remains an organism label.
299210006,Postprocedural finding of upper limb (finding),Chart notes: postprocedural finding of the upper limb,"This entry indicates the chart contains a postprocedural finding localized to the upper limb. Category: Clinical finding. The code 299210006 is the precise match, as it captures both the timing (after a procedure) and the anatomical site. More general concepts omit the site, and more specific children add a type of finding not stated here. Siblings for different regions do not apply."
431884001,Specimen from gallbladder obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Gallbladder fine needle aspiration biopsy sample,"This entry conveys that the sample is a specimen obtained from the gallbladder using fine needle aspiration biopsy. The main attributes are body site (gallbladder) and acquisition method (FNA biopsy), fitting the Specimen category and matching SCTID 431884001. More general or alternate-technique concepts would be inappropriate because the technique is specified. ‘Sample’ is an acceptable synonym for specimen and does not introduce any new attributes."
110516000,Breast and axillary tissue (combined site) (body structure),Breast and axillary tissues (single site),"The plural 'tissues' here refers to the two tissues included in the single combined site, breast and axillary. The concept remains an anatomic body structure, with no additional attributes like laterality, pathology, or procedures. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 110516000 is the appropriate mapping because it specifies the combined site of breast and axillary tissue. Parent concepts focusing on one tissue alone or broader regional sites would be less precise, and sibling concepts identifying lymph nodes or specific subparts would add unintended specificity. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that preserves the intended concept."
128583004,Structure of mesenteric vein (body structure),Mesenteric vein,"The entry names the anatomical vessel 'mesenteric vein' without any qualifiers, findings, or procedural context, pointing directly to the body structure concept. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This best matches 'Structure of mesenteric vein' (SCTID 128583004) because it denotes the vein in the mesentery generically and does not specify superior or inferior branches. More specific children such as 'Structure of superior mesenteric vein' or 'Structure of inferior mesenteric vein' are not indicated, and broader or different siblings (e.g., mesenteric artery, portal vein, or the mesenteric venous system) are not referenced. The term is a straightforward synonym that does not change code selection."
1153537004,Antigen of inactivated whole severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (substance),ELISA coating antigen: inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2,"The phrase specifies the antigen used for an ELISA coating and clarifies that it is derived from inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This matches SCTID 1153537004, as the entry retains the whole-virion and inactivated qualifiers; parents would be too broad, and siblings like 'spike antigen' do not apply. The assay context does not add attributes that would change the substance concept."
1149017006,Histologic type of primary malignant neoplasm of urethra (observable entity),Histologic type parameter—primary malignant neoplasm of urethra,"The term “parameter” here denotes the observable attribute (histologic type) applied to a primary malignant urethral neoplasm. The main concept is an Observable entity for histologic classification, not a disorder or a test result value. SNOMED CT 1149017006 is the precise match because it captures histologic type for the primary urethral malignancy. Parent concepts lacking site or primary status are too general, and sibling or child concepts either shift the attribute (e.g., grade) or specify a particular histology, which this entry does not."
51101000087104,Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgical procedure (procedure),Postoperative note: hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery performed,"The note confirms that the performed procedure was hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Category: Procedure. Although the phrase includes postoperative context, the key coded concept remains the specific procedure performed, which matches SCTID 51101000087104. No organ or additional qualifiers are present, so it does not map to situation-type ‘history of’ or to child organ-specific procedures."
160281003,Family history: Syphilis (situation),Intake history lists syphilis in the family,"This wording assigns syphilis to the family medical history during intake, not to the patient. This is a Situation with explicit context scenario. The exact match is SCTID 160281003. A general parent like Family history of disease would be insufficiently specific. Sibling concepts are inappropriate as they refer to different conditions. The entry avoids new attributes like timing or relative type and thus maps precisely to family history of syphilis."
421006007,West Virginia (geographic location),"West Virginia, United States","The entry names West Virginia and situates it within its country, but the core concept remains the geographic location 'West Virginia'. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value — geographic location. The added country context does not change the coding target, which is the state itself. A parent concept like 'United States of America' would be too broad, and any city or county within West Virginia would be a child and therefore too narrow. This phrasing remains uniquely codable to West Virginia (geographic location)."
215460004,"Submersion or drowning due to falling from crushed watercraft, occupant of small powered boat injured (event)","Assessment: submersion/drowning from fall off crushed small motorboat, injured occupant","This assessment captures submersion/drowning resulting from a fall off a crushed small motorboat, noting that the occupant is injured. It maps to SCTID 215460004 under the Event hierarchy. ""Small motorboat"" equals ""small powered boat."" The entry avoids parent-level generality and excludes sibling concepts (e.g., nonpowered boats, capsizing). There are no additional attributes such as timing, intent, or severity; the wording remains precisely within the concept scope."
722361000,Biological sterilization indicator reader (physical object),Biological indicator reader hardware,"Describing the device as 'hardware' maintains the physical object scope: a reader for biological indicators. No procedural or method attributes are introduced. This aligns with the Physical object category and maps best to SCTID 722361000. Parent generic hardware is too broad, and siblings like incubators or chemical readers are excluded by the explicit focus on biological indicator reading."
258480001,Transtracheal aspirate specimen (specimen),Transtracheal aspirate specimen,"The phrase explicitly names the specimen type as a transtracheal aspirate, which is a SNOMED CT Specimen concept. This maps directly and precisely to Transtracheal aspirate specimen (SCTID 258480001). It does not describe the procedure, results, timing, or any other attributes, avoiding parent concepts like generic “Aspirate specimen” and sibling concepts such as “Tracheal aspirate specimen” or “Endotracheal aspirate specimen.”"
420170009,Phylum Chytridiomycota (organism),Specimen shows Chytridiomycota,"This statement indicates that the specimen contains organisms from the phylum Chytridiomycota, aligning with SNOMED CT 420170009 (Organism). The wording does not assert infection or identify species, precluding disorder or child-level codes. Parent fungal categories would be less specific, and sibling phyla do not match; the phylum concept is exact for this entry."
72691000052107,Body weight of biological mother (observable entity),Body weight of the patient’s biological mother,"The entry clearly delineates the observable (body weight) and the subject (the patient’s biological mother). Category: Observable entity. This directly corresponds to SNOMED CT 72691000052107 and excludes broader or unrelated observables. The wording does not add timing (e.g., prenatal), results, or severity, so it does not suggest child concepts like prepregnancy weight. Sibling concepts involving other relatives or metrics (BMI) are not implicated."
697311010000103,Immunoglobulin E antibody to cream cheese (substance),IgE to cream cheese,"This entry uses standard shorthand (IgE) to indicate an immunoglobulin E antibody specific to cream cheese, referring to the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It is best coded to 697311010000103 because it communicates the antigen target (cream cheese) and antibody class (IgE) without stating a lab result, level, or a clinical finding like allergy. Parent concepts (e.g., IgE antibody) lack the target specificity, and sibling concepts (e.g., IgE to cheese or to milk) would misrepresent the stated antigen. Shorthand does not alter the code selection."
388523006,Subfamily Lutrinae (organism),Lutrinae - otters,"The concept is the otter subfamily, expressed by the Latin taxon Lutrinae and the common name otters, without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This is best coded as Subfamily Lutrinae (organism), not the broader Mustelidae nor specific species like giant otter, making parent and child concepts less suitable. The synonym “otters” is equivalent to Lutrinae as a group."
464206004,Barostat application software (physical object),Barostat program (application),"By specifying “program (application),” the entry clarifies that it is application software designed for a barostat, which matches Barostat application software (Physical object, SCTID: 464206004). A generic application software parent would be nonspecific, and hardware or firmware siblings would not match the application layer indicated here. The synonym preserves equivalence and avoids adding attributes such as version, platform, or use-case subsets."
44975001,Peristedion thompsoni (organism),Species: Peristedion thompsoni,"This entry explicitly indicates a species-level taxon and names Peristedion thompsoni, without introducing any attributes beyond taxonomic rank and identity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The code 44975001 is the most precise match because it represents this exact species. Mapping to a parent concept (genus Peristedion or broader animal categories) would reduce specificity and contradict the stated species. Sibling species are excluded by the explicit naming of thompsoni. No strain, subspecies, or variant is mentioned, so child concepts are not applicable. The descriptor “Species:” is merely contextual and does not alter the coding choice."
411729008,Musa species diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergy reagent—Musa species extract,"This entry characterizes the product as a 'diagnostic allergy reagent' and designates the extract's source as 'Musa species,' which precisely describes the concept. Category: Product. It avoids procedure codes and therapeutic contexts. Broader parent products lack the Musa source, while narrower child concepts may single out banana or plantain extracts. 'Reagent' and 'extract' together are conventional descriptors that do not alter code selection."
1382291002,Swab from vaginal vault (specimen),Specimen received: high vaginal swab,"This entry documents receipt of a high vaginal swab specimen, which is the standard term for a swab taken from the vaginal vault. The main concept is a specimen; there are no details on tests or clinical findings. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 1382291002 is the most specific match because the source is the vault. Parent 'vaginal swab specimen' is broader, and procedure concepts are excluded by the specimen-focused wording."
446562005,Body fluid specimen obtained via sump drain (specimen),Body fluid specimen collected from sump drain output,"This wording documents a body fluid specimen collected from the output of a sump drain, which aligns with SNOMED CT 446562005. The main concepts are a body fluid specimen and a sump drain as the source. The category is Specimen. It is more precise than the parent concept because the route/device is given, and it avoids siblings with other drains. Mentioning “output” does not add fluid type or anatomical site; it clarifies that the specimen was taken from the drain’s effluent without changing the underlying concept."
540971000124109,Mass of right lower lobe of lung (finding),Assessment: mass of the right lower lobe of lung,"The assessment states the presence of a mass localized to the right lower lobe of the lung, with no additional attributes. It corresponds exactly to the Clinical finding “Mass of right lower lobe of lung” (SCTID: 540971000124109). Broader parent concepts omit lobar specificity, and alternatives like “tumor” or “nodule” would imply different morphology or etiology. The phrasing is a direct semantic equivalent and supports selection of the given code."
462843008,"Patient monitoring system module, intracardiac oximetry (physical object)",Patient monitor add-on module for intracardiac oximetry,The described item is an add-on module for a patient monitor that provides intracardiac oximetry. Category: Physical object. SCTID 462843008 is the most precise match because it specifies a patient monitoring system module dedicated to intracardiac oxygen saturation measurement. Generic add-on modules or nonintracardiac oximetry modules are less appropriate. It is not a catheter or implant; the context is a monitor module. “Add-on module” is a clinically acceptable synonym for a modular component and does not change the intended concept.
419904009,Ability to verbalize: medication self-dose adjustment methods (observable entity),Patient describes strategies for self-directed medication dose adjustment.,"The key concept is the patient describing (verbalizing) strategies for adjusting their own medication dose, which is an Observable entity corresponding to SCTID 419904009. “Describes strategies” is equivalent to verbalizing methods; it does not introduce extra attributes like indications, severity, or drug specificity. A mapping to broader knowledge or education concepts would be less precise, and mapping to performing dose adjustments rather than verbalizing them would be incorrect given the phrasing."
303441004,Unable to construct things (finding),Construction tasks: unable to carry out.,"The phrasing explicitly links 'construction tasks' with inability to perform them, which is semantically equivalent to being unable to construct things. No extra attributes are added. It is categorized as a Clinical finding. Code 303441004 is the best match because it captures generalized inability to construct. Using apraxia-related concepts would imply neurological causation; using 'difficulty' concepts would misrepresent the absolute inability stated."
241139001,Gastrointestinal tract contrast procedure (procedure),Contrast-enhanced GI tract study,"This statement indicates a procedural study of the GI tract enhanced by contrast, avoiding modality or localized anatomy. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It corresponds to SCTID 241139001. Parent concepts are overly general without site or contrast, and children like 'Barium swallow' or 'Barium enema' add specificity not present here. 'Contrast-enhanced' is a clinically safe synonym for the application of contrast material and preserves the intended concept."
781548005,Product containing adenosine receptor antagonist (product),Pharmaceutical product with adenosine receptor antagonist,"This entry describes a pharmaceutical product defined by inclusion of an adenosine receptor antagonist as its active pharmacologic class, which is precisely the target SNOMED CT product concept. It remains at the mechanism-of-action product class level and avoids specifying a particular molecule (e.g., caffeine) or any formulation details, so child ingredient-specific concepts are excluded. A parent like 'Pharmaceutical product' lacks the MOA specificity and would be less accurate. The wording does not imply receptor subtype (A1, A2A) or agonism, so siblings are not a better fit."
184244004,Obstetric co-op card duplicate (record artifact),Duplicate obstetric co-op card exists,"Existence statement remains focused on the artifact’s duplication; it does not add other attributes. The main concept is the obstetric co-op card with duplication. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The entry aligns with 184244004, which specifically represents a duplicate obstetric co-op card. Parent concepts for generic duplicate records fail to specify this card, and siblings for other obstetric or maternity artifacts or the non-duplicate card are less appropriate. The wording is a semantically equivalent paraphrase and supports the same precise code."
167806003,Total count of motile spermatozoa (procedure),TMSC (total motile sperm count) ordered,"This entry documents ordering the procedure commonly abbreviated as TMSC, which is clinically synonymous with ‘total count of motile spermatozoa.’ The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Mentioning “ordered” reflects workflow status without changing the nature of the test; it does not introduce result values, percentages, or concentration. TMSC refers specifically to total motile sperm count, making this more precise than a parent semen analysis and distinct from siblings measuring percentage motility or concentration."
297730000,Susu language (qualifier value),Communication language: Susu,"This indicates that the communication language value is Susu, focusing solely on the language without specifying preference or skill level. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 297730000 best fits the explicitly named language. Parent language categories are too general, and sibling languages would be incorrect. The wording is a contextual label that leaves the coded concept as the Susu language."
224446009,Employers attitude to health problem (finding),Patient reports employer attitude to their health problem,"This patient-reported statement documents the employer’s attitude to the patient’s health problem. Category: Clinical finding. Source of information (patient-reported) does not change the concept; it remains employer attitude in relation to a health problem, matching SNOMED CT 224446009. No further attributes are given, so more general or more specific concepts would be inappropriate."
215173009,Pedal cycle accident hit by falling or thrown object (event),Occupational health incident: cycling—hit by a falling or thrown object,"This entry indicates an occupational documentation context but the event itself is a cycling accident caused by being hit by a falling or thrown object. It is an Event and exactly fits SCTID 215173009. The context (occupational note) does not add attributes that would change coding. Parent concepts would be too general, and siblings like collisions or falls are not applicable. The synonyms used for cycling and being ‘hit by’ a falling/thrown object are clinically equivalent and preserve the intended concept."
287747001,Spermatic cord hydrocele repair (procedure),Operative note: spermatic cord hydrocele repair,"This entry uses an operative note context but still names the specific procedure—repair of a hydrocele of the spermatic cord—making it a Procedure mapping to SCTID 287747001. The context does not alter the coded concept; it simply indicates documentation. No technique or additional attributes are specified. Parents are too broad, and technique-specific children would require wording like excision, which is absent. It avoids misclassification to other hydrocele sites."
218028004,Accident caused by electric can opener (event),Electric can opener accident,This phrase denotes an accident with the specified device: an electric can opener. It represents an Event in SNOMED CT and corresponds to SCTID 218028004. It does not introduce additional attributes such as injury details or context. A parent like 'accident caused by household appliance' would be too general. It also distinguishes from siblings that involve non-electric can openers. The condensed synonym is clinically equivalent to 'accident caused by electric can opener' without altering meaning.
281666001,Family history of disorder (situation),Positive family history for a disorder,"‘Positive’ indicates presence of the family history, and ‘a disorder’ maintains the unspecified nature of the condition. The concept is a situation statement: family history present. This maps best to SNOMED CT Family history of disorder (281666001). It avoids additional attributes or specifying a particular disease, making child concepts inappropriate. It also avoids broader phrasing like ‘clinical finding,’ so parent/sibling concepts are less precise than ‘disorder.’"
770844001,Structure of nail plate of third toe (body structure),Identified anatomy: ungual plate of toe three,"Using the synonym “ungual plate” for nail plate and specifying “toe three” pinpoints the third toe’s nail plate, a Body structure. The appropriate SNOMED CT code is 770844001. Parent concepts lack digit specificity, and sibling concepts for other nail parts or laterality would change the intended structure. The phrasing is descriptive and does not add clinical attributes."
130867000,(+)-delta-cadinene synthase (substance),Listed as (+)-delta-cadinene synthase,"The text identifies the substance by its exact name, (+)-delta-cadinene synthase, within a listing context. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The explicit enantiomeric specification guarantees that the correct concept 130867000 is selected, instead of a parent concept lacking enantiomer detail or a sibling representing the (−) enantiomer. The listing context does not alter the substance’s identity or add attributes."
702898000,Parkinson's disease clinic (environment),Parkinson disease clinic,"This is a spelling variant omitting the apostrophe, still denoting the same Parkinson’s disease–focused clinic environment. The concept referenced is a clinic specialized in Parkinson’s disease without introducing additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It precisely matches SCTID 702898000 as the disease-specific clinic setting. Parent concepts like clinic (environment) lack the disease specificity, and siblings like movement disorder clinic would be too broad. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
360513008,Structure of segment of right coronary artery (body structure),Anatomy note: segment of RCA,"This notation uses 'RCA' to mean right coronary artery and specifies a 'segment,' matching the body structure concept Structure of segment of right coronary artery. The entry does not introduce disease, intervention, or positional qualifiers. It is more specific than the parent right coronary artery and does not require child concepts such as proximal/mid/distal segments. Sibling structures from other coronary vessels or branches are excluded. The abbreviation is a clinically safe synonym and does not change the chosen code."
1003481001,Silicone foam (substance),Identified material: silicone foam,"The entry confirms the identified material is silicone foam, a direct substance reference. Category: Substance. No product/device implications are introduced, maintaining alignment with the substance hierarchy. Parent silicone is too broad, and sibling product concepts do not apply. Use Silicone foam (SCTID: 1003481001)."
59510000,Struck by cave-in (event),Patient reports being struck by a cave-in,This patient-reported statement identifies the same external cause event without adding injury or environmental details. It fits the Event hierarchy and maps precisely to “Struck by cave-in (event)” SCTID 59510000. Parent concepts are broader and siblings that imply entrapment or falling objects are less accurate. The phrasing is an equivalent paraphrase emphasizing the report source but not altering the core concept.
434464009,Tissue cassette (physical object),Tissue cassette (physical object),"The entry explicitly names the concept and its SNOMED category, denoting the physical object used to hold tissue during processing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 434464009 directly matches this wording. Parent or generic container concepts lack specificity, and sibling objects such as tissue blocks or slides are different artifacts. The parenthetical clarifies category without altering the object."
256604008,Dental die - silver (substance),Material identified as dental die—silver,"This entry documents identification of the material as silver in the context of a dental die, mapping precisely to Dental die - silver (substance), a Substance concept. It remains focused on the substance and application without adding attributes such as purity, alloy type, or temporal qualifiers. Broader concepts like Silver (substance) or Dental die material (substance) are less specific, and sibling materials do not apply. The phrasing 'identified as' is neutral context and keeps the semantic target unchanged, preserving correct code selection."
1263453001,Thoracic total disc replacement prosthesis (physical object),Device: thoracic total disc replacement prosthesis,"The label format “Device:” followed by “thoracic total disc replacement prosthesis” identifies the physical object, mapping to SNOMED CT 1263453001 under the Physical object category. It avoids implying presence or procedural actions and does not introduce level, brand, or laterality attributes. More general device concepts without thoracic specification would be less accurate, and other regional or partial devices would be incorrect."
608951003,Microscopic examination of bacterial smear of specimen from surgical wound (procedure),Specimen source: surgical wound; Procedure: microscopic exam of bacterial smear,"Report-style documentation specifying the specimen source and the procedure type: microscopy of a bacterial smear. Category: Procedure. This is a precise match to SCTID 608951003 because it defines both the smear type (bacterial) and the source (surgical wound), without adding technique details that would shift to a child concept."
720215008,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Cladosporium (substance),IgG antibody against Cladosporium,"This wording identifies an IgG antibody directed against Cladosporium, which maps to the SNOMED CT substance 'Immunoglobulin G antibody to Cladosporium' (SCTID 720215008). Category: Substance. It does not introduce any result interpretation, severity, or temporal attributes; it solely names the antibody substance. A parent like 'IgG antibody to mold' is too broad, and siblings such as 'IgE antibody against Cladosporium' differ in isotype. More specific children referencing a particular Cladosporium species are inappropriate because the entry refers to the genus without species specification. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and maintains exact scope."
427558003,Specimen obtained by core needle biopsy (specimen),Biopsy specimen via core needle,"The main concept is a biopsy specimen, specifically obtained via a core needle approach, which defines the specimen type. This falls under the Specimen hierarchy and maps to SNOMED CT 427558003. The wording avoids procedure coding and does not specify any anatomical site, preventing drift to child concepts. It is more specific than “biopsy specimen” or “needle biopsy specimen” parents and distinguishes from siblings like “fine needle aspiration specimen.” The paraphrase is clinically equivalent."
257395002,Polyester suture (physical object),Wound closure utilized polyester suture,"The sentence provides procedural context but the coded concept referenced is the physical object used—polyester suture. It adds no attributes like size, coating, or needle attachment. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The most precise match is Polyester suture; choosing a parent like generic suture would lose the material specificity, and selecting a procedural code (suturing) would be incorrect because the focus is on the object used."
298370007,Temporomandibular joint stability (observable entity),Monitor TMJ stability,"This entry indicates the intention to monitor the property 'stability' of the temporomandibular joint over time; it does not express any outcome, severity, or laterality. The focus remains on the observable property, making it an Observable entity. The accurate mapping is 'Temporomandibular joint stability (observable entity).' Parent concepts like 'Joint stability' are too generic, and sibling findings asserting stability or instability would misrepresent the non-result nature of the phrase."
424396007,Record organizer (record artifact),Organizer grouping element (record),"The entry describes an organizer as the element that groups items in a record, i.e., the organizer artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is a precise match to SCTID 424396007, and does not drift toward Record section or Record header, which are separate structures. 'Grouping element' is a functional paraphrase of organizer and does not introduce new attributes beyond the inherent organizing role."
298645004,Range of lumbar spine right rotation (observable entity),Lumbar spine right rotation ROM,"This entry explicitly denotes the observable property 'range of motion' (ROM) for the movement 'right rotation' at the anatomical site 'lumbar spine.' No results, qualifiers, or procedure wording are included, keeping it as an Observable entity rather than a finding or an intervention. The most precise SNOMED CT match is SCTID 298645004 (Range of lumbar spine right rotation) because it encodes lumbar spine, rotation, right laterality, and 'range.' Broader parents like 'Range of motion of lumbar spine' or 'Range of lumbar spine rotation' omit the right-sided direction, and siblings such as 'Range of lumbar spine left rotation' do not match the specified laterality. 'ROM' is a standard clinical synonym for 'range of motion' and does not alter code selection."
1365796005,Photographic extraoral image of superior view of face (record artifact),Superior view of face — extraoral photograph,"This concise phrasing denotes a record artifact: an extraoral photograph of the face with a superior view. SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The inclusion of the view attribute makes it specific, not mapping to a generic extraoral facial photograph. It excludes sibling concepts that describe other orientations. The term choices are semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
247428002,Thickness of skin (observable entity),Evaluated skin thickness,"The entry focuses on evaluation of the property of skin thickness without introducing method, site, or interpretation. It maps to the SNOMED CT Observable entity Thickness of skin (247428002). It avoids specificity that would push to children like layer-specific thickness and does not indicate a fold or anthropometric context. It also avoids normal/abnormal qualifiers, keeping it out of finding/disorder territory."
897363001,Patchy sclerosis of proximal phalanx of third toe (finding),Follow-up note: patchy sclerosis of the third toe proximal phalanx,"This documents patchy sclerosis in the proximal phalanx of the third toe within a follow-up context. Category: Clinical finding. The content specifically matches the concept “Patchy sclerosis of proximal phalanx of third toe,” so SCTID 897363001 is the precise code. The follow-up context does not introduce attributes that change the finding. Parent concepts lack specificity, and siblings for other toes or different sclerosis patterns would not fit."
405194004,Antepartum maternal status (observable entity),Report section: antepartum maternal status,"This label denotes a report section dedicated to the observable entity of maternal status in the antepartum period. It maps to SCTID 405194004 (Observable entity). No attributes beyond the antepartum timeframe are introduced, preventing misclassification to the parent ‘maternal status’ or to sibling concepts like intrapartum/postpartum or fetal status."
223806002,Louth (geographic location),Birthplace recorded as Louth,"The phrase documents birthplace and identifies “Louth” as the location, with the geographic entity being the coded concept. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The appropriate code is Louth (geographic location) [223806002], since no details are given to select a more specific child (county or town), and a parent geographic category would be too vague. The wording is consistent with the generic place name."
1187143004,South Sudan (geographic location),South Sudan,"The main concept explicitly named is the country South Sudan, which is a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The preferred term directly matches SCTID 1187143004, making it the most precise code. Parent concepts such as broader regions (e.g., Africa) are less specific, and child concepts (e.g., cities like Juba) or siblings (e.g., Sudan) would be incorrect. No added attributes are introduced, so the plain country name maps exactly to the given concept."
419350000,Micrograms per gram hemoglobin (qualifier value),micrograms per gram hemoglobin,"This is the full textual expression of the unit micrograms per gram hemoglobin with no abbreviations. The concept is purely a unit and carries no additional attributes. Category: Qualifier value. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 419350000, which is the qualifier for this unit. Broader or sibling units (e.g., micrograms per gram without specifying hemoglobin, or micrograms per gram creatinine) differ in the denominator, so they would be less appropriate. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term, ensuring precise coding."
161787007,History of inter-menstrual bleeding (situation),Problem list item: history of intermenstrual bleeding.,"This entry records the history of intermenstrual bleeding as a problem list item, clearly indicating past occurrence. The concept is intermenstrual bleeding with explicit historical context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 161787007 exactly fits. Coding to 'Intermenstrual bleeding (finding)' would misrepresent the temporal context, and broader items like 'History of abnormal uterine bleeding' are less specific than the intermenstrual qualifier."
170686001,Psychiatric treatment started (situation),Case note: psychiatric treatment begun.,"The phrase communicates the start of psychiatric treatment, with “begun” equivalent to “started.” It falls under the Situation hierarchy and maps to Psychiatric treatment started (situation). It omits details of type or reason for treatment, avoiding child concepts such as psychotherapy started or specific drug therapy initiation. Parent concepts are overly broad and do not capture the psychiatric focus."
702003004,Ossicular prosthesis introducer handpiece (physical object),Middle ear prosthesis introducer handpiece,"This wording describes the same instrument using “middle ear prosthesis,” which is a clinically equivalent synonym for “ossicular prosthesis.” The main concept remains an introducer handpiece for middle ear prostheses. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 702003004 is the best fit because it specifies a handpiece introducer for ossicular/middle ear prostheses. More general parent concepts (e.g., “introducer handpiece”) or sibling devices for other prosthesis types (e.g., stapes-specific introducers) would be less accurate. The synonym does not add attributes or change scope."
105497000,Threat of dismissal (finding),"""My boss threatened to fire me,"" patient statement","This patient-reported quote conveys an explicit threat of being fired by the boss, i.e., dismissal. Category: Clinical finding. It maps to SNOMED CT 105497000 because the content is a threat of dismissal. The quotation and patient-report context do not introduce conflicting attributes. Parent or sibling codes (e.g., actual firing, non-employment threats) would be less accurate. ""Fire me"" is a common synonym for dismissal and does not change code selection."
280904008,Structure of pulp of thumb (body structure),Thumb pulp,"This is a concise synonym for the same anatomy: the distal digital pad of the thumb. It does not add any attributes like laterality or clinical findings; it simply denotes the body structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The most precise code is 280904008 'Structure of pulp of thumb' because the term specifies the pulp of the thumb. Parent concepts such as 'Thumb structure' are too general, and sibling concepts involving other digits or thumb nail/thenar regions would not match the intended anatomical site."
345121001,Heteronymous bilateral visual field defects (finding),Heteronymous bilateral visual field defect,"The entry explicitly states a bilateral visual field defect with a heteronymous pattern, meaning opposite sides of the visual field are affected between the two eyes. This matches the SNOMED CT Clinical finding concept 345121001, which represents heteronymous bilateral visual field defects without specifying subtype (e.g., hemianopia or quadrantanopia) or side. More general parents like “visual field defect” or “bilateral visual field defect” do not capture the heteronymous attribute, while children or siblings such as “heteronymous hemianopia,” “bitemporal hemianopia,” or “homonymous hemianopia” add specificity not present here. The term “defect” is equivalent to “loss/deficit” in this context and does not change the code selection."
223761002,Regions of Philippines (geographic location),Regional divisions of the Philippines,"This states the regional-level divisions that organize the Philippines administratively, without specifying any single region. The main concept is a geographic location class at the regional tier. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223761002 is appropriate because it targets the regions collectively rather than the country, provinces, or other localities. No child concepts are suggested, as no specific region is named. The term “divisions” is an acceptable paraphrase of administrative regions, retaining equivalence without adding attributes."
1363029004,Hospital observation unit (environment),Department: hospital observation unit,"Here, the department field names the hospital observation unit, reflecting the environment concept SCTID 1363029004. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. While many hospitals label units as departments, the content precisely identifies an observation unit inside the hospital. It avoids implying ED-specific observation or other specialty units, keeping it within the intended environment concept and not a parent or sibling."
242966000,Sexual assault on female with touching of unclothed vulva (event),Police/medical liaison note: sexual assault on female with touching of uncovered vulva,"The liaison note documents a sexual assault event in a female, specifying touching of the uncovered (unclothed) vulva. The main concept is sexual assault with vulvar touching; category Event. “Uncovered” is equivalent to “unclothed.” This maps directly to SNOMED CT 242966000, whereas parent or sibling concepts would change the act, body site, clothing status, or victim sex."
361828005,Entire synovial membrane (body structure),Synovium,"“Synovium” is a widely used clinical synonym for the synovial membrane. It denotes the same anatomical lining without adding attributes of site or pathology, making Body structure the correct category. The best code is Entire synovial membrane (361828005), as it represents the generic whole membrane. Parent concepts are less specific, and child concepts that specify the synovium of a particular location are not supported. Siblings such as synovial fluid or synovial cavity are different entities."
387176008,Enflurane (substance),Enflurane (chemical entity),"Labeling enflurane as a chemical entity directly references the substance concept. Category is Substance. The best match is SNOMED CT 387176008; there is no suggestion of product, administration, or broader class membership, and no sibling substance (e.g., isoflurane, sevoflurane) is implied."
370379002,Antenatal ultrasound finding (finding),Antepartum ultrasound finding,"The wording indicates a finding arising from an ultrasound during the antepartum (antenatal) phase of pregnancy. The concept identified is a clinical finding, not a procedure or a test result statement with interpretation. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 370379002 matches because 'antepartum' is a standard synonym for antenatal context. Parent concepts like generic ultrasound findings lack pregnancy context, and siblings/children that add specificity (e.g., normal or abnormal) would be incorrect here."
105478000,Fighting at school (finding),Psychological evaluation notes fighting at school,"This evaluation entry records fighting occurring in the school setting, directly representing the concept without added attributes. SNOMED CT 105478000, Fighting at school (finding), in the Clinical finding hierarchy, is the exact match. Parent concepts are too broad (e.g., aggressive behavior), and sibling concepts like bullying at school or truancy are behaviorally different. The evaluation context is incidental and preserves the same code."
1193604000,Structure of pupillomotor system (body structure),Anatomical structure: pupillomotor system,"The entry explicitly identifies the pupillomotor system as an anatomical structure, aligning with the body structure concept. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to SCTID 1193604000 because it names the system without asserting function, pathology, or subcomponents. Broader parents like “nervous system structure” lack the specificity, and narrower pathways or muscles are not indicated."
350556000,Product containing cation exchange resin (product),Cation exchange resin-containing drug product,"This states a drug product that contains a cation exchange resin, aligning with the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category. It matches SCTID 350556000 because it names the ingredient class but refrains from brand, route, or specific salt details that would necessitate a child concept. It is not a nonspecific drug product (parent) and does not imply other resin types (siblings). 'Drug product' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that keeps the same code selection."
1148837002,Acid-base balance within reference range (finding),No acid-base disturbance.,"Stating no disturbance signifies the acid-base status is normal and not deviating from reference. The main concept is acid-base balance with the negative finding indicating normality. Category: Clinical finding. While phrased as an absence, it is clinically equivalent to within reference range. A code for generic normal finding in a different system or for the absence of a disorder would be less precise than Acid-base balance within reference range; abnormal siblings are expressly negated by the entry."
214450001,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving fall from car in street while boarding or alighting, motor cyclist injured (event)",Accident description: noncollision MVA with fall from car on street during boarding/alighting; injury sustained by motorcyclist.,"This description includes noncollision motor vehicle accident (MVA), a fall from a car, on the street, during boarding/alighting, and specifies the injured party as a motorcyclist, matching the Event 214450001. Abbreviations like MVA are conventional and do not change meaning. Parent concepts lacking detail or sibling concepts involving collision or different victims would be less accurate. Thus the specific code is warranted."
773509008,Ophthalmology care plan (record artifact),Ophthalmology care plan recorded in EHR,"This entry conveys that a care plan artifact for ophthalmology exists within the electronic health record; it does not assert a procedural action for coding, only the artifact’s presence. The SNOMED category is Record artifact. The most precise code is Ophthalmology care plan (SCTID: 773509008). Using the parent Care plan would be less specific, while choosing a sibling like a documentation procedure or review would misclassify the intent. The phrase “recorded in EHR” is contextual and does not change the underlying artifact."
391935006,Pericardiolysis (procedure),Pericardial adhesiolysis,"This phrase is a clinically standard synonym meaning lysis of adhesions of the pericardium. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It is semantically equivalent to pericardiolysis and maps to SCTID 391935006, as it specifies the target (pericardium) and the action (adhesiolysis). Concepts like pericardiectomy (removal) or pericardial window (fenestration) would be inappropriate because no removal or fenestration is indicated. The wording does not introduce approach, timing, or associated conditions."
710297000,Failed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (situation),Operative note: laparoscopic cholecystectomy failed,"This represents operative documentation stating that the laparoscopic cholecystectomy failed, without specifying cause or subsequent conversion. The main concept remains a failed lap chole. Category: Situation with explicit context. Code 710297000 is the correct selection. Alternatives like abandoned or converted procedures would require explicit mention of those attributes, which are not present here."
4461000087102,Fluoroscopic arthrography of right temporomandibular joint (procedure),Fluoro-guided arthrogram of right TMJ.,"Main concept: fluoroscopy-guided arthrography of the right temporomandibular joint. Attributes: modality (fluoroscopy), procedure (arthrogram/arthrography), site (TMJ), laterality (right). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. 'Fluoro-guided' is a common shorthand for fluoroscopic guidance and maps directly to Fluoroscopic arthrography of right temporomandibular joint. This excludes parent concepts that do not specify modality and sibling concepts involving a different side or imaging method."
286717006,Emotionally blunted character (finding),Emotionally blunted character documented,"This entry indicates documentation of an emotionally blunted character, clearly identifying the characterological nature of the finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. 'Emotionally blunted character (finding)' is the most precise code because it aligns with a personality trait, not a momentary affect. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings like 'Blunted affect' describe different clinical observations. The phrasing is a straightforward synonym without added timing, severity, or cause."
118536000,Entitic number (property) (qualifier value),Entitic number noted as property of the test,"The wording indicates that the test's property is 'entitic number,' the number per single entity attribute. The concept is the property qualifier designation. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 118536000 is the exact fit; the text specifically identifies entitic number, not generic property or other property kinds. It avoids siblings like entitic volume or concentration. No additional measurement specifics are introduced."
284762008,Underground railway station (environment),Location: underground railway station,"The contextual label ‘Location’ simply indicates documentation of the environmental setting, which is an underground railway station, without adding other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This maps directly to ‘Underground railway station (environment)’ (SCTID: 284762008). Using the parent ‘railway station’ would be less specific; station parts or non-rail environments are not suggested."
1287676000,Frontal lobe primary motor cortex epileptic seizure (finding),Epileptic seizure originating from the frontal lobe primary motor cortex,"This text states an epileptic seizure and specifies the origin as the frontal lobe primary motor cortex, aligning exactly with SCTID 1287676000. The main concept is the seizure; the explicit attribute is its location (primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe). Category: Clinical finding. Parent concepts like “Epileptic seizure” or “Frontal lobe seizure” lack the primary motor cortex specification and are therefore less precise. Siblings involving other frontal subregions (e.g., supplementary motor area) are not appropriate as the entry clearly identifies the primary motor cortex. The phrasing “originating from” is clinically equivalent to “ictal onset in,” without adding any additional attributes such as timing, severity, or laterality."
4331000179104,Clinical immunology report (record artifact),Clinical immunology report documentation,"The wording points to documentation that is specifically a report from clinical immunology, mapping to Clinical immunology report (record artifact) [4331000179104]. It does not add any detail about findings or procedures, keeping it at the artifact level and avoiding child concepts. Parent categories are too general without the specialty designation, and siblings in other specialties are not indicated. 'Documentation' here is a synonym for the report document and does not alter the concept."
146349008,Entire occipital branch of posterior auricular artery (body structure),Occipital branch of the posterior auricular artery (complete structure),"This entry specifies the occipital branch of the posterior auricular artery and indicates it is the complete (clinically equivalent to “entire”) structure. No lateral, pathological, or procedural attributes are added. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to SCTID 146349008. Choosing the parent artery or any sibling branch would be less precise. “Complete structure” does not introduce new meaning beyond whole anatomy, so it avoids child concepts that represent only a part of the branch."
223520000,Burundi (geographic location),Location—Burundi,"The term identifies a location and specifies Burundi, remaining confined to the geographic entity. SNOMED CT category: Location—Geographic location. No attributes such as time, residency, or travel are added, so SCTID 223520000 is the most precise mapping. Parent classes (e.g., Country) lack specificity, and children (provincial names) or siblings (neighboring countries) do not match the text. The em dash is stylistic and does not affect semantics."
736057009,Respiratory disorder inpatient care plan (record artifact),Respiratory disorder inpatient care plan in chart,"‘In chart’ indicates the presence of the care plan as a record artifact; the content targets a respiratory disorder and the inpatient setting. This maps to Respiratory disorder inpatient care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736057009. Category: Record artifact. It is not an outpatient or discharge plan and does not name specific respiratory diagnoses that would be children. No additional clinical attributes are introduced."
232888003,Shortening operation on atrioventricular valve papillary muscle (procedure),Procedure performed: shortening of the atrioventricular valve papillary muscle,"The entry states that the procedure performed is a shortening of the papillary muscle of an atrioventricular valve. The main concept is the surgical shortening operation. Category: Procedure. It matches SNOMED CT 232888003 since it names the exact targeted structure and the intervention. There is no mention of mitral vs. tricuspid, so a generic AV concept is correct rather than a child. It neither broadens to a general repair nor implies different actions like release or resection. The wording is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term, preserving code selection."
442667005,Stereoscopic view decremented from baseline (qualifier value),Stereoscopic view less than baseline.,"The wording 'less than baseline' for stereoscopic view denotes a decrement relative to baseline, matching SCTID 442667005 as a Qualifier value. It introduces no additional attributes. A parent qualifier of generic 'less than baseline' without stereoscopic focus is less specific, and sibling qualifiers (greater than baseline or at baseline) do not fit. 'Less than' is synonymous with decreased in this comparative context and preserves the intended code selection."
406490005,Shigella boydii 18 (organism),Organism label: Shigella boydii type 18,"This labels the organism and uses 'type 18,' a clinically equivalent synonym for serotype 18. It is an Organism concept, best matched to SCTID 406490005. A parent concept without the type number is too general; other types/serotypes are sibling and not appropriate. The entry includes no clinical attributes beyond the organism name."
298342005,Truncal posture (observable entity),Rehab note: truncal posture,"This rehab documentation reference targets the observable variable 'truncal posture' without a result or descriptor. The category is Observable entity, and the accurate code is SNOMED 298342005. The entry avoids specifying abnormality, severity, or circumstances, preventing mapping to child findings or to broader posture observables."
438041005,Streptomyces thermocarboxydovorans (organism),Sequencing match: Streptomyces thermocarboxydovorans,"This entry states that sequencing matched the species Streptomyces thermocarboxydovorans, without adding attributes such as site or clinical significance. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 438041005 is the precise mapping because the organism is identified at the species level. Broader genus concepts are less accurate, and no strain or variant detail is present. 'Sequencing match' is contextual and does not transform the concept into a finding; the coded value remains the organism."
285084006,Day nursery (environment),Day nursery context,"“Context” here signals that the relevant environmental setting is a day nursery, mapping cleanly to SNOMED CT 285084006 (Environment or geographical location). No added attributes like incident, timing, or occupational status are introduced. Broader or different settings (e.g., preschool, adult day care, hospital nursery) would not reflect this exact wording."
462360005,Radiation shielding head wear (physical object),Radiation protective head cap,"The item is a head cap designed for radiation protection, which is a type of headwear, thus semantically equivalent to radiation shielding head wear. Category: Physical object. It fits SCTID 462360005 because it specifies head-mounted radiation shielding without adding material or thickness attributes. A non-radiation protective cap or protective cap for other hazards (e.g., impact) would be inappropriate. 'Head cap' is a acceptable synonym for headwear."
371784004,Body parts for identification (specimen),Pathology: body parts for identification specimen,"The entry conveys a pathology-context specimen composed of body parts intended for identification. The SNOMED category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 371784004 by naming both material and purpose; the pathology context is documentation setting, not a change in specimen type. More general parent categories omit the identification element, while sibling types (e.g., tissue for histology) add analytic attributes not stated. This is a safe paraphrase preserving code selection."
469867001,Hyperthermia system chair (physical object),Hyperthermia treatment system chair,"This variant explicitly ties the chair to the hyperthermia treatment system, maintaining a focus on the physical object. No extra details such as model or availability are included. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It is the best match for SCTID 469867001 because it specifies 'chair' in the hyperthermia system context. Parent terms like 'hyperthermia system' without 'chair' are too broad, and sibling structures like 'treatment system couch' are different furnishings."
366257004,Finding related to ability to defecate (finding),Patient reports on ability to defecate (finding),"This entry reflects a patient-reported clinical finding concerning the ability to defecate, devoid of detail about normality or impairment. Category: Clinical finding. The code 366257004 is appropriate since it covers findings related to defecation capability. Child concepts would require an explicit abnormal condition, and broader parents would dilute the defecation-specific context; the phrasing remains equivalent to the concept without extra attributes."
184816005,Local authority employee - report (record artifact),Report issued by a local authority employee,"This specifies a report and identifies its issuer/author as a local authority employee, fitting the Record artifact category. It matches 'Local authority employee - report (record artifact).' The verb 'issued' is acceptable as a synonym for produced/authored in administrative contexts and does not add new attributes. Parent 'Report' lacks author role, and role-specific children (e.g., social worker) are not indicated, making the given code most accurate."
75812009,Blood group antibody Wr^a^ (substance),Anti-Wr(a) (red cell blood group antibody),"This entry labels the substance as a red cell blood group antibody with Wr(a) specificity—i.e., anti‑Wr(a). It avoids presence or detection statements and remains a substance reference. Therefore, SNOMED CT Substance 75812009 is the exact match. Parent concepts lack specificity; siblings are not suggested. The parenthetical description is domain clarification, not an added attribute."
440207009,Streptomyces cyaneofuscatus (organism),Taxonomic entry—Streptomyces cyaneofuscatus,"The entry indicates a taxonomic listing and provides the species name Streptomyces cyaneofuscatus, directly aligning with SNOMED CT Organism SCTID 440207009. No clinical or laboratory result is implied; it is a neutral designation of the organism. Parent genus or higher-level organism categories would be too broad, and other Streptomyces species (siblings) would be incorrect. The species-level organism code is therefore the most precise match."
161119008,Primary school (environment),Elementary school setting,"The entry denotes an environmental setting tied to an elementary/primary school, maintaining the Environment or geographical location category. “Elementary” is an accepted synonym for “primary.” No new attributes are introduced. SCTID 161119008 is the exact fit. A parent like “School setting” lacks the specified level, and siblings such as “Secondary school setting” would change the meaning. Structural or organizational concepts are ruled out because this explicitly addresses setting, not a building or service."
183713004,Immunology domiciliary visit requested (finding),Home visitation by immunology requested.,"The entry records that a home visitation (domiciliary visit) by immunology has been requested, without additional attributes like urgency or outcome. The main concept is a request for an immunology domiciliary visit, a Clinical finding. The best SNOMED CT code is Immunology domiciliary visit requested (183713004). Broader parent concepts or siblings such as immunology consultation or outpatient visit requested do not specify the home setting. It does not suggest scheduling or completion, so child concepts indicating those conditions would be less appropriate."
1351334000,Entire central zone of prostate (body structure),Prostate central zone — complete,"Main concept: complete (entire) central zone of the prostate. Attributes: organ (prostate), subregion (central zone), completeness (complete). SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The term 'complete' is synonymous with 'entire,' supporting mapping to SCTID 1351334000. This does not refer to the central gland or other zones and is more specific than the entire prostate, thereby avoiding parent or sibling concepts."
40371000087100,Combined specimen from swab of axillary fossa and inguinal region (specimen),Lab specimen: combined swab of axillary fossa and inguinal region,"This entry denotes a laboratory specimen consisting of a combined swab from the axillary fossa and inguinal region. It specifies specimen, method (swab), and the two anatomical sites, establishing combined nature. It fits the SNOMED CT Specimen hierarchy and is an exact match to the concept for combined swab specimen from those sites. A general lab specimen or single-site swab would not capture the dual-site combined aspect, and other combined-site siblings would be incorrect. The added ‘Lab specimen’ context does not alter attributes relevant to coding."
467481000,Cardiopulmonary bypass system air bubble/fluid level detector (physical object),Inventory entry: heart-lung machine air bubble/fluid level detector,"This entry references a device in inventory for a heart-lung machine (CPB system) that detects air bubbles and fluid level, which is a Physical object (device). The inventory context is neutral with respect to coding. 'Heart-lung machine' is a well-established synonym for CPB system, and the explicit dual detection functions match the concept. Broader device categories or single-function detectors would not be as precise."
736245005,Pediatric community complex care plan (record artifact),Pediatric community complex care plan entry,"‘Entry’ indicates a specific item in the medical record representing the pediatric community complex care plan, preserving the same artifact concept. The main concept is a care plan record entry; attributes are pediatric and community. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This best matches 736245005; it is more specific than general care plan entries and avoids mismatches with non-pediatric or non-community complex care plans."
311527008,Polyester fumes (substance),Material: polyester fumes,"The entry uses 'Material' as a documentation context, naming 'polyester fumes' as the specific material, which remains a Substance concept in SNOMED CT: Polyester fumes (substance). It does not add attributes such as cause, timing, severity, or clinical events. Choosing a parent concept like 'Polyester' would drop the fume specification, and selecting siblings like 'Polycarbonate fumes' would be incorrect for this wording. Therefore, the precise concept is the designated substance 'polyester fumes.'"
86671006,Structure of mediastinum of testis (body structure),Specimen orientation marker: mediastinum of testis,"This entry identifies the mediastinum of the testis as an orientation marker for a specimen, still naming the same anatomy. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches Structure of mediastinum of testis (86671006) because the orientation marker refers to that specific anatomical part. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling/child terms would misrepresent the structure. The context does not introduce pathology or laterality; it simply references the anatomy."
1343306006,Radioactive cesium needle (physical object),Radiocesium needle,"‘Radiocesium’ refers to radioactive cesium, and paired with ‘needle’ it denotes the exact physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This best fits SCTID 1343306006, since it captures the cesium-based radiation source in needle form. Broader parents (e.g., ‘radioactive needle’) or siblings (e.g., ‘radiocesium seed’) would misrepresent either material specificity or the device form. The synonym ‘radiocesium’ is an accepted equivalent and does not add attributes."
725869001,Record of implantation of cardiac electronic device (record artifact),Chart entry: cardiac electronic device implantation record,"A chart entry that is a record of cardiac electronic device implantation is a documentation artifact. The main concept is the record itself, not the clinical event or current device status. This fits the Record artifact hierarchy and matches 725869001 specifically. Generic parent record artifacts lack the subject detail; device-type-specific children or siblings aren’t indicated. The term ""chart entry"" is a form of record and does not alter coding."
334253005,Absorbent cotton (physical object),Absorbent cotton fibers,"This wording points to absorbent cotton in fiber form, but does not specify a manufactured form such as balls or pads; it remains the same material concept. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It fits Absorbent cotton (physical object), SCTID 334253005, rather than broader “cotton” or sibling entities like “cotton ball” or “cotton roll,” which add shape/packaging attributes not present in the entry."
577921000005107,Referral to smoking cessation assistance not done (situation),Smoking cessation assistance referral not sent,"The phrase conveys that the referral to smoking cessation assistance was not transmitted/sent, indicating it was not performed. This fits the Situation with explicit context (procedure not done). The wording avoids causes or statuses like pending or cancelled, making performed referral and reason-specific siblings incorrect. “Not sent” is an administrative synonym for non-performance of a referral and does not introduce new attributes."
1279742004,Development of nutrition care plan (procedure),Nutrition care plan developed,"This phrasing indicates the completion of the development process for a nutrition care plan, which is the same procedure as the target concept. It is a Procedure, aligning with SNOMED CT code 1279742004. Alternatives like generic care plan development would be too broad (parent), and activities like updating or reviewing a plan would be siblings but not equivalent. The wording does not introduce extra attributes and remains focused on plan development, making the code selection appropriate."
422365004,Structure of lateral incisor tooth (body structure),Element of dentition: lateral incisor tooth,"The phrase identifies the lateral incisor tooth as a component of the dentition, i.e., a body structure. Category: Body structure. It corresponds to SCTID 422365004. No extra attributes (e.g., side, arch, stage) are provided, making child concepts too specific. The presence of 'lateral' rules out mapping to broader incisor structures or central incisor siblings."
702919008,Schizophrenia clinic (environment),Clinic specializing in schizophrenia,"The phrase identifies the clinic’s specialization—schizophrenia—without adding service type, timing, or patient attributes, describing a care setting. SNOMED CT category: Environment (Environment or geographical location). This matches Schizophrenia clinic (environment) [702919008] exactly because it is a clinic whose scope is schizophrenia. More general clinic concepts would be too broad, and any child concept specifying ambulatory or inpatient would be too detailed relative to the entry’s neutral setting."
315012009,Heartsave card (record artifact),Heartsave card noted,This is a concise documentation statement focusing on the Heartsave card as the artifact; it introduces no clinical qualifiers. Category: Record artifact. SCTID 315012009 best matches due to the explicit Heartsave identification; parent generic card or sibling emergency alert artifacts are less precise for this wording.
472923004,Peripheral vascular catheter tip submitted as specimen (specimen),Peripheral vascular catheter tip identified as specimen,"This entry states that the specimen identified is the tip of a peripheral vascular catheter. The category is Specimen. It perfectly fits SCTID 472923004 because it captures peripheral vascular, catheter tip, and specimen submission/identification. Parent concepts lack peripheral specificity, and siblings like central venous catheter tip specimens would be incorrect. There are no added attributes beyond specimen identification."
411893008,"Tetramin, fish feed specific diagnostic allergen extract (product)",Tetramin fish food allergen extract (diagnostic),"This entry explicitly states a diagnostic allergen extract related to Tetramin fish food, with the parenthetical reinforcing diagnostic use. The main concept is a branded allergen extract product; attributes are source (Tetramin fish food) and diagnostic role. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It precisely matches SCTID 411893008. Parent concepts lacking the brand source are too broad, and sibling concepts for different fish foods or non-diagnostic extracts would not fit. The parenthetical “diagnostic” is a conventional labeling consistent with the product description and does not add extraneous properties."
715953005,Mayotte (geographic location),Chart lists location as Mayotte,"This documentation statement identifies Mayotte as the listed location in the chart, matching the concept Mayotte (SCTID: 715953005). The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The phrase does not add clinical attributes like timing or conditions; it simply denotes the place. A general parent like Geographic location is too broad, and sibling territories are not referenced. The entry uniquely represents the geographic location of Mayotte."
450765008,Lymphocyte antigen CD154 (substance),gp39 protein (CD40 ligand/CD154),"The concept is gp39, explicitly clarified as CD40 ligand/CD154, preventing ambiguity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 450765008 is appropriate because the entry denotes the antigen itself and avoids attributes like recombinant status, labeling, or soluble forms. Parent classes (e.g., generic glycoproteins) are too broad, and siblings are distinct antigens. This synonym is accepted in immunology and does not alter the coding."
371545006,Confirmatory consultation report (record artifact),Confirmatory consultation report on chart,"This wording points to the confirmatory consultation report as a chart document. The main concept is the document artifact; 'on chart' is workflow context without altering the concept. Category: Record artifact. The best match is 371545006, Confirmatory consultation report. Using a parent like Consultation report would lose the confirmatory specificity, and sibling concepts (e.g., initial or follow-up consult reports) do not align with the stated confirmatory purpose."
302977008,Accident to specialized powered vehicle not for use on public roadway (event),Follow-up on accident involving specialized powered vehicle not used on public roads,"This follow-up note references an accident involving a specialized powered vehicle that is not used on public roads. Main concept: accident event; attributes: specialized, powered, non-public road. Category: Event. SCTID 302977008 precisely represents this scenario. More general accident categories would miss the non-road specification, and more specific child concepts (e.g., forklift accident) are not stated. The follow-up context does not alter the underlying event concept."
736362002,Minor urologic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Care planning entry: inpatient minor urologic surgery,"This reflects a care planning record entry documenting an inpatient plan related to a minor urologic surgery. The attributes are care plan artifact, inpatient setting, urologic surgery specialty, and minor scope. In SNOMED CT this is a Record artifact and corresponds to “Minor urologic surgery inpatient care plan.” A parent artifact lacking the minor designation would be less specific, and sibling artifacts for major surgeries would misrepresent severity. ‘Care planning entry’ is a synonymous way to describe the care plan document and does not add extraneous attributes."
122594008,Tears specimen (specimen),Tear fluid specimen,"The term 'tear fluid' is a clinically acceptable synonym for tears (lacrimal fluid) and indicates the material collected as a specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This matches Tears specimen (122594008) and does not introduce subtype, purpose, or method. Parent categories are less specific, and siblings like saliva specimen are clearly not intended."
227608002,Chocolate candy (substance),Nutrition note: chocolate candy,"Chocolate candy is documented in a nutrition note, with the concept centered on the confection substance. Category: Substance. The most accurate code is Chocolate candy (substance) SCTID 227608002. Broader parents (Candy or Chocolate substances) do not capture the combined specificity. No mention of detailed types or compositions means sibling or child concepts are not appropriate. The context phrase 'Nutrition note' does not introduce attributes."
79233002,Leucocytozoon costai (organism),Organism name: Leucocytozoon costai,"This formulation identifies the organism by its scientific name, aligning with the SNOMED CT Organism concept Leucocytozoon costai (SCTID 79233002). It conveys taxonomy only, without suggesting detection or disease, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate. No additional attributes such as host, site, or severity are present."
32448004,Structure of cortex of occipital lobe (body structure),Occipital lobe cortical region,"This entry describes the cortical region belonging to the occipital lobe, an anatomical body structure. The exact SNOMED CT mapping is “Structure of cortex of occipital lobe” (SCTID 32448004). It refrains from naming specific visual areas and adds no attributes like laterality or pathology, so children such as “Primary visual cortex” are not appropriate. It is narrower than the parents (occipital lobe or cerebral cortex) and rules out sibling lobar cortices. “Region” functions here as a neutral anatomical synonym, leaving the code selection unchanged."
448077001,Intraepidermal route (qualifier value),Delivery method: intraepidermal route,"This designates the delivery method specifically as the intraepidermal route, meaning into the epidermis. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 448077001 is the most accurate mapping because it targets the epidermal layer; intradermal, subcutaneous, transdermal, or epicutaneous routes describe different tissue levels or surface application. The parent route concept lacks this specificity. The entry adds no extra clinical information beyond the route attribute, supporting unique coding to the intraepidermal route."
270372007,Disabled driver orange badge report (record artifact),Disabled driver Orange Badge report provided,"The term “provided” indicates provision of the same report, not a distinct artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The core concept remains the exact report associated with the Orange Badge, making the specific SNOMED concept the most precise. Broader record artifacts or sibling documents like applications or certificates are not implied. No new medical attributes are introduced."
61442008,Structure of tubal branch of uterine artery (body structure),Surgical landmark—tubal branch of uterine artery,"The entry identifies the tubal branch of the uterine artery in a surgical context as a landmark, while still referring only to the structure itself. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 61442008 fits exactly. Neither parent concepts (uterine artery) nor sibling branches (vaginal or cervical) are implied. No attribute such as injury or laterality is added."
703725008,Culture technique (qualifier value),Technique of test recorded: culture.,"This states that the technique of the test was culture, indicating a method qualifier rather than a procedure or result. The concept is a Qualifier value, precisely matching Culture technique (qualifier value) [703725008]. A broader parent such as Technique (qualifier value) is less specific, and culture procedure concepts would incorrectly code an action performed. No attributes suggest child concepts like anaerobic culture technique, and no sibling techniques (e.g., PCR, staining) are implicated. The wording is clinically equivalent to 'culture technique' and supports the exact code."
707637004,Ribosomal ribonucleic acid of Coccidioides (substance),Molecular target: Coccidioides ribosomal ribonucleic acid,"The entry specifies the substance as a molecular target without implying detection status or technique. Main concept: ribosomal RNA of Coccidioides. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This fits SCTID 707637004 precisely, not a parent like general Coccidioides RNA or nucleic acid, nor a sibling like DNA. It avoids narrowing to species-level or an rRNA subunit child. Synonymous phrasing preserves clinical equivalence."
411943005,Ambrosia psilostachya specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Western ragweed diagnostic allergen extract (Ambrosia psilostachya),"This entry uses the common name 'western ragweed' alongside the scientific name Ambrosia psilostachya and explicitly states it is a diagnostic allergen extract, mapping precisely to the product concept 411943005. The main concept is a diagnostic allergen extract specific to the species; no details about dosing, concentration, or therapeutic use are present. The inclusion of the common name is a clinically accepted synonym for Ambrosia psilostachya and does not change code selection. Parent concepts are too generic, sibling species (e.g., common ragweed) would be incorrect, and therapeutic allergen extracts would be inappropriate due to the diagnostic qualifier."
411126008,Patch test product (product),Patch test product item,"The term 'item' maintains the product focus and does not change the meaning; it still denotes the patch test product. SNOMED CT category: Product. This fits 411126008, the generic patch test product concept, without adding attributes like kit status, dosage form, or allergen specificity. Therefore parent, sibling, or child codes would be less appropriate."
250774007,Inspired oxygen concentration (observable entity),Inspired O2 fraction,"The entry states the fraction of oxygen in inspired gas, which is a clinically standard synonym for inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2). It remains the observable property without a measurement result or context. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity; 250774007 specifically models this property. It is not a finding (no result), not oxygen saturation (blood-derived), and not expired oxygen concentration (different phase of respiration), so parent, child, or sibling concepts would be less accurate."
228740006,Lung block (physical object),Lung block identified,"The identification context does not alter the object; it still denotes a lung block. No extra qualifiers (e.g., processing status, laterality) are given. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and SCTID 228740006 (Lung block) is correct. Selecting a broader parent would lose lung specificity, while specimen/procedure siblings (e.g., lung specimen, biopsy) would miscode the entry because it references the block object itself."
12597001,Tin (substance),"Tin, pure element","The wording indicates tin in its pure elemental form with no additional chemical attributes. Main concept: pure elemental tin; attribute: purity qualifier that still denotes the element. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This is best coded as Tin (substance) [12597001], as it does not introduce ionic state, isotopes, or compounds. Parent concepts like 'chemical element' are broader, and children such as specific tin ions are explicitly excluded."
119612001,Hip joint closure (procedure),Hip joint closure only,"This states that the procedure performed was hip joint closure, emphasizing exclusivity but not adding clinical attributes to the concept itself. It is a Procedure, mapped to Hip joint closure (procedure) SCTID 119612001. It does not reference capsule, arthrotomy, or wound, thus avoiding misclassification to child or sibling concepts. The added word 'only' does not change the target or action and remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
75758000,Gobionellus gracillimus (organism),Photo identification: Gobionellus gracillimus,"The entry reports identification from a photograph as Gobionellus gracillimus, which conveys the species-level Organism concept SCTID 75758000. The imaging context is incidental and does not add clinical attributes. Parents (genus Gobionellus or fish) would be too broad, and siblings would be incorrect, making the exact species code appropriate."
462836002,Multiple diagnostic/therapeutic radiation mobile medical facility (physical object),Mobile multi-service radiation medicine facility (diagnostic and therapeutic),"This text describes a mobile radiation medicine facility that is multi-service, explicitly including both diagnostic and therapeutic roles. The concepts are mobility, facility, radiation medicine, and dual diagnostic/therapeutic services. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 462836002 fits because it represents a mobile medical facility offering multiple diagnostic and therapeutic radiation services. A general 'radiation medicine facility' or single-service mobile unit would not capture the specified combination. The phrase uses acceptable synonyms and clarifies both functions without adding attributes like modality, timing, or location."
64371009,Euphorbia lathyris (organism),Recorded taxon: Euphorbia lathyris,"The phrase records the taxon at the species level, Euphorbia lathyris. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This directly corresponds to SCTID 64371009, whereas broader taxa (genus or family) or other species would not match the entry. It introduces no clinical attributes; it is purely taxonomic identification."
223706009,Jamaica (geographic location),Jamaica (geographic location),"This explicitly states the toponym and its type as a geographic location, with no additional clinical attributes. The main concept is the place name Jamaica. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). Jamaica (geographic location) SCTID 223706009 is the exact concept. More general concepts like 'Country' or 'Geographic location' are less precise, and alternate places named 'Jamaica' (e.g., in New York) are not referenced. The parenthetical clarification mirrors the FSN and does not change code selection."
359065006,Low protein flour and mixes (product),Dietitian recommendation: low-protein flour and mixes,"Though presented as a recommendation, the coded entity remains the product 'low-protein flour and mixes,' matching SNOMED CT 359065006 (Product). The entry includes both flour and mixes under the low-protein qualifier, making broader parents or narrower children/siblings inappropriate. The recommendation context does not change the product identity or add attributes that would necessitate a different concept."
55208007,Bunostomum trigonocephalum (organism),Microbiology organism: Bunostomum trigonocephalum,"The entry indicates the organism reported in a microbiology context and specifies Bunostomum trigonocephalum. The suitable SNOMED CT concept is Organism SCTID 55208007. It does not add clinical attributes (infection, host, or stage), avoiding misclassification as a result finding or disorder. A genus-level code would be less specific, and other species would be incorrect relative to the stated name. The contextual label 'Microbiology organism' is descriptive and maintains species-level precision."
231034006,Biopsy of spinal nerve ganglion lesion (procedure),Biopsy of lesion of spinal ganglion of spinal nerve,"This phrasing elaborates the site as the spinal ganglion of the spinal nerve and identifies the action as a biopsy of its lesion. The concept is a Procedure. It is a precise match to SCTID 231034006, as it asserts the correct structure and target, without specifying approach or guidance. More generic parents lack the site specificity, while method-specific or different-structure siblings/children are not supported by the text."
700834006,Electronic thermometer probe cover (physical object),Electronic thermometer probe cover — device accessory,"Labeling it a ‘device accessory’ clarifies its role, but the object remains a probe cover intended for an electronic thermometer. No additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This aligns with SCTID 700834006, more specific than generic probe cover parents and not suggestive of site- or modality-specific children or siblings."
249266007,Thickening of spermatic cord (finding),Exam finding: thickening in the spermatic cord,"The entry identifies thickening within the spermatic cord as an exam finding, without severity, etiology, laterality, or timing. It is a Clinical finding suitable for SNOMED CT 249266007. Parent concepts are overly broad, and siblings such as vas deferens thickening or cord edema differ in anatomical focus or morphological nature. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term."
401085002,Hemochromatosis gene screening test (procedure),Patient underwent hemochromatosis gene screening,"This is a patient-centered phrasing indicating the performance of the hemochromatosis gene screening procedure. The core concept is still the genetic screening; no results or alternate context are added. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 401085002 fits best. It is not a general genetic test (parent), nor does it specify particular mutations or genes (child/sibling), and it is clearly genetic rather than biochemical screening. The patient-reported performance wording does not convert this to a “history of” finding; it documents the procedure itself."
3574007,Genus Bitis (organism),"Bitis, identified at genus level",This statement indicates that identification has been resolved to the genus Bitis without further species resolution. Main concept: Bitis genus. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The best match is Genus Bitis (3574007) since the level of taxonomy is explicitly genus. Parent (family) or child (species) concepts would misrepresent the specificity. The phrasing is a synonymic paraphrase and does not add clinical or exposure attributes.
358227002,Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis solution (product),CAPD peritoneal dialysis fluid,"This entry identifies the product used in CAPD, using 'fluid' as a clinically equivalent synonym for 'solution/dialysate' in the PD context. Category: Product. It fits SCTID 358227002 because it is CAPD-specific and avoids any additional attributes (e.g., dextrose strength, buffer type). Parent concepts are too general, and child concepts involving specific formulations or brands would be too narrow. It does not represent a procedure or device, so sibling codes for CAPD procedures or equipment are not appropriate."
5085001,Gonococcemia (finding),Blood culture positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae,"A positive blood culture for N. gonorrhoeae constitutes gonococcemia. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This wording precisely conveys organism-in-blood with laboratory confirmation, matching gonococcemia and not adding attributes like severity or associated conditions. Generic bacteremia is less specific, and sepsis or disseminated infection would be incorrect because they describe additional clinical states not asserted here."
284556001,Private tennis court (environment),Private tennis court setting,"The entry explicitly names the setting as a private tennis court, which is a precise match for SNOMED CT 284556001 (environment). It does not introduce indoor/outdoor, institutional, or public qualifiers. Thus, the parent Tennis court (environment) is too broad, and public-related siblings are incompatible with private specification."
1345148005,Aspiration of substance into lower respiratory tract (event),Aspiration into lower respiratory tract recorded,"The core clinical concept is an aspiration event into the lower respiratory tract with a documentation context implied by 'recorded.' This aligns with SNOMED CT Event 1345148005. No extra attributes such as substance type, timing, or sequelae are introduced, preventing shifts to more specific or different concepts. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that maintains the same code."
34824002,Anabaena flos-aquae (organism),Taxon recorded: Anabaena flos-aquae,"This entry records the taxon at species level—Anabaena flos-aquae—aligning with the Organism concept SCTID 34824002. 'Taxon recorded' is a documentation context and does not imply detection, disease, or environmental attributes. Parent (genus or higher) or sibling species are not referenced, ensuring the exact species code is most appropriate."
1306629001,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Imaging note: photographic extraoral 45° view of right half of face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion.,"This entry describes an extraoral photographic image documented in an imaging note, specifying a 45° right half facial view with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It aligns perfectly with the concept’s attribute set: modality (photographic), site (face), laterality (right half), angle (45°), lip posture (closed), and occlusal state (centric). Parents that omit these details or siblings that change any attribute (e.g., left side, different angle, open lips) would be less appropriate. The narrative context does not add clinical attributes."
736365000,Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care plan (record artifact),ED note: acute exacerbation of COPD care plan initiated,"This statement documents initiation of a care plan for AECOPD within an ED note, which is still a Record artifact. The key concept is the care plan targeting the acute exacerbation, matching the SNOMED care plan artifact. The initiation status does not add clinical attributes beyond the plan's existence. Disorder concepts or procedural management would be incorrect here since the entry refers to the documentation of the plan, not the disorder occurrence or interventions done."
216248009,"Sucked into aircraft jet, without accident to aircraft, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)",Provider note: crew member of a commercial plane injured—sucked into jet intake; aircraft itself had no accident; surface-to-surface transport.,"The provider note captures an Event with mechanism (sucked into jet intake), role (crew member of commercial plane), aircraft status (no accident), and context (surface-to-surface transport), consistent with SCTID 216248009. Parent categories lack specificity; sibling codes for passenger injuries or aircraft-accident scenarios are inappropriate. “Jet intake” and “commercial plane” are clinically equivalent terms to the preferred wording."
149380004,Entire spiral modiolar artery (body structure),Teaching note: spiral modiolar artery,"Educational context naming the specific artery leaves the anatomical concept unchanged and precise. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to SCTID 149380004 by identifying the entire spiral modiolar artery. Parents like 'inner ear artery' are not as specific, and children like side-specific variants add attributes absent here. The teaching label does not affect code selection; the synonym remains equivalent."
472904006,Swab from abdomen (specimen),ED triage note: swab from abdomen,"This entry records a swab specimen with an abdominal source within an emergency department context. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It directly maps to “Swab from abdomen (specimen)” SCTID 472904006 because it states both specimen type and site without extra qualifiers. A parent such as ‘Swab specimen’ would omit the site, and children that identify specific abdominal subsites or wound-related specimens are not indicated here."
409607005,Class II biological safety cabinet (physical object),Class 2 biological containment cabinet,"Using “Class 2” with “biological containment cabinet” is clinically congruent with Class II BSC terminology. The concept is a Physical object. The explicit class maps to SCTID 409607005, excluding parent generality and sibling classes. No subtype, brand, or functional attributes are added, keeping it aligned to the exact concept."
416700005,Written operative report (record artifact),Written operative report added to EHR,"The entry indicates that a written operative report has been added to the electronic health record, focusing on the artifact. The main concept is the written operative report; 'added to EHR' is workflow context and does not change the document type. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 416700005 is the most precise because it explicitly captures a written operative report. Parent concepts without the written qualifier would be less specific, and sibling artifacts like operative notes differ in type. The wording remains a clinically equivalent expression."
444959000,Peritoneal dialysis fluid specimen obtained before dialysis (specimen),"Order documentation: specimen—peritoneal dialysis fluid, pre-dialysis","This order documentation specifies the specimen as peritoneal dialysis fluid with a pre-dialysis timing. The main concept is the specimen source and the timing qualifier. Category: Specimen. This exactly matches SCTID 444959000 (peritoneal dialysis fluid specimen obtained before dialysis). A generic peritoneal dialysis fluid specimen would be less precise, and timing variants (during/after) would be inappropriate. No test details are included, ensuring the entry focuses solely on the specimen designation."
304071007,Souttar tube (physical object),Souttar catheter,"This is a common clinical synonym for the same eponymous device; in many contexts the Souttar tube is referred to as a catheter. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). It maps to Souttar tube (physical object), SCTID 304071007, as an equivalent device name without adding anatomical site, function, or timing. More general parent concepts like ‘catheter’ are too broad, and sibling named catheters are different devices."
447068006,Bacillus subtilis subspecies inaquosorum (organism),Organism: Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum,"This document-style entry explicitly labels the item as an organism, then provides the exact subspecies name. The category is Organism and the code SCTID 447068006 applies. The context marker “Organism:” does not introduce clinical attributes; it simply clarifies the taxonomic entity. The specificity to the inaquosorum subspecies avoids mapping to the parent species or other subspecies."
462849007,"Pulsed signal therapy system generator, portable (physical object)",Returned item: portable pulsed signal therapy system generator,"In a logistics context, the object remains a portable generator for a pulsed signal therapy system. No additional attributes beyond portability and the therapy type are introduced. The concept is a Physical object/device, mapping to SCTID 462849007. It does not indicate the entire system or a non-portable/implantable variant, avoiding parent or sibling mismatches."
3536004,Anopheles grabhanii (organism),Anopheles grabhanii species,"This phrasing denotes the species Anopheles grabhanii and nothing else—no detection, stage, or clinical association is implied. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 3536004 is the exact species-level concept. Using a genus-level organism or another species would be less precise or wrong. The wording is a straightforward synonym indicating the same taxon."
255290008,Petaloid (qualifier value),Classified as petaloid,"The classification term applied is “petaloid,” which is a shape/appearance Qualifier value. It maps directly to Petaloid (qualifier value), SCTID 255290008. The phrase does not introduce body structure, disorder, severity, timing, or causation, and does not imply a different morphology, so broader parent qualifiers or sibling descriptors are less accurate than the exact petaloid value."
73882002,Diplectrum bivittatum (organism),Organism name: Diplectrum bivittatum,"The wording presents Diplectrum bivittatum as the organism name, which directly corresponds to the species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This matches SCTID 73882002 exactly because the entry identifies the precise taxon. It does not imply exposure, infection, or any clinical finding, avoiding inappropriate mapping to parent or related concepts. No child or sibling species are mentioned, ensuring specificity."
367740008,Suspension - action (qualifier value),Surgery action designation: suspension,"This indicates the surgical action designation is 'suspension,' mapping to 'Suspension - action' (367740008). The category is Qualifier value. It does not add additional procedural attributes, so the action qualifier is the precise match. A parent 'Action' concept would be overly broad, and different action siblings would be incorrect. The entry is not about stopping treatment or pharmaceutical suspensions; it refers to the operative action."
1332390002,Implantable cardiac defibrillator component (physical object),ICD device component noted on imaging,"This entry references an implantable cardiac defibrillator device component within an imaging context, but the central noun remains a generic ICD component. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 1332390002 is appropriate because the object being referenced is a non-specific ICD component; the imaging context does not alter the identity of the physical object. Coding to presence or imaging findings would be less precise than coding the object itself."
394914008,Radiology - specialty (qualifier value),Radiology (specialty),"This phrasing indicates Radiology in the context of a clinical specialty, without adding scope, subtype, or actions. The primary concept is Radiology as a specialty, a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT. It precisely maps to 394914008. Organizational terms like “Radiology department” or procedural concepts are not referenced, and no child sub-specialty (e.g., interventional) is specified."
258561000,Parotid gland saliva specimen (specimen),Laboratory specimen—parotid gland saliva,"The entry labels the laboratory specimen as parotid gland saliva, indicating both the specimen type and its origin. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 258561000 because it specifies saliva from the parotid gland with no added attributes (e.g., laterality, stimulation, or test methodology). A generic parent such as “Saliva specimen” is insufficiently specific, and siblings like “Submandibular gland saliva specimen” are incorrect given the stated source. The lab-context phrasing is a safe paraphrase that does not alter code selection."
2054101000122107,Tremelimumab (substance),Substance identified: tremelimumab,"The phrase identifies tremelimumab as a substance and does not include any product or administration details. The main concept is the Substance category in SNOMED CT. The Tremelimumab (substance) code is the best match. Higher-level parents (e.g., monoclonal antibody substances) are too broad, and medicinal product children are inappropriate without formulation attributes."
140561000119102,Long-term current use of azathioprine (situation),Azathioprine: chronic ongoing medication,"This entry lists azathioprine and qualifies it as chronic and ongoing, which are clinically synonymous with long-term current use. The main concept is present long-term azathioprine use. SNOMED CT category: Situation. It maps exactly to 140561000119102 because it encodes the explicit context of current and prolonged use for azathioprine. More generic parent concepts that do not specify the medication, or sibling concepts that omit long-term or current context, are less appropriate. The synonym “chronic” does not add severity or indication; it reflects duration only."
309264007,Excised rectum specimen (specimen),Resected rectum specimen,"The term 'resected' is synonymous with 'excised' in surgical pathology context, and paired with 'rectum specimen' it maps precisely to SNOMED CT 309264007, a Specimen concept. It is more specific than 'Rectum specimen' by indicating procurement method and does not drift into siblings like 'Rectal tissue specimen' (tissue subset) or 'Rectosigmoid resection specimen' (additional anatomy). No additional attributes are introduced."
299008002,Passive range of wrist pronation (observable entity),Passive range parameter: pronation of wrist,"This phrasing identifies the parameter being measured—the passive range—for the pronation movement at the wrist. Category: Observable entity. It aligns with Passive range of wrist pronation (299008002) and does not shift to broader or sibling concepts. The term 'parameter' reflects its status as an observable and does not introduce values, timing, or modifiers, keeping the mapping precise to this concept."
70661000119105,History of arthrodesis of ankle (situation),Ankle joint fusion documented in history,"This states that ankle joint fusion (synonymous with arthrodesis) is documented in the patient's history. The category is Situation with explicit context. It maps exactly to SCTID 70661000119105 because it denotes a prior ankle arthrodesis without extra attributes. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts would either generalize surgery or specify different joints. The synonym 'fusion' is clinically equivalent to 'arthrodesis.'"
28991000087102,Swab from epiglottis (specimen),Swab of the epiglottis,"The wording indicates a swab taken from the epiglottis, specifying both specimen type and anatomical source without extra qualifiers. The main concept is a specimen; SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This maps exactly to Swab from epiglottis (specimen), SCTID 28991000087102. It is more specific than parent swab categories and distinct from siblings targeting other sites (e.g., oropharynx or larynx). The phrasing is a direct synonym that preserves the intended meaning."
275142008,Sick child (situation),Parent reports sick child,"This entry captures a situational context where a caregiver conveys that the child is sick, without adding clinical details. It aligns with “Sick child (situation)” SCTID 275142008 in SNOMED CT, emphasizing the scenario rather than a diagnosis. The source of information (parent) does not alter the core concept of a child being sick, so it remains a situation. Broader or alternate concepts for illness, complaints, or caregiver reports would be less precise because they lack the explicit child-and-sickness pairing. No attributes such as severity, timing, or specific symptoms are introduced."
701021004,Darkroom automated x-ray film processor (physical object),Darkroom automated radiographic film processor,This is a physical object: an automated processor for radiographic (x-ray) films that operates in a darkroom. Category: Physical object. 'Radiographic' and 'x-ray' are clinically equivalent descriptors for the film type. The inclusion of 'darkroom automated' matches the defining characteristics of SCTID 701021004. Broader devices (radiographic film processor without modality) or different modalities (daylight processing) would be parent/sibling concepts and less precise for this wording.
57008001,Structure of internal thoracic vein (body structure),Vascular structure name: internal mammary vein,"The entry names the vascular structure as the internal mammary vein, a recognized synonym for the internal thoracic vein. It is a Body structure and maps to SNOMED CT 57008001. There are no added attributes (e.g., side, condition, or procedure). Parent categories like general thoracic veins are too broad, and child laterality concepts are not specified. The synonym maintains equivalence without changing the code."
16490003,"Anorectal continence, function (observable entity)",Anorectal continence function under follow-up,"This entry specifies that the observable, anorectal continence function, is being followed over time, yet it does not state any value or abnormality. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 16490003 is the correct code because the concept remains the function of anorectal continence. Coding to a disorder like fecal incontinence would imply an abnormal finding that is not expressed, and a generic continence follow-up would be too broad. The follow-up context does not change the observable; it only indicates ongoing observation."
228345003,Use of stratagems to control drinking (observable entity),Nursing intake: patient uses techniques to control drinking,"This nursing note documents the observable use of techniques to control drinking, which matches the concept of stratagem use in alcohol management. The main concept is technique use for control without added attributes like effectiveness or temporal context. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 228345003 is precise, whereas broader or sibling concepts like alcohol reduction or abstinence would misrepresent the entry by implying outcomes. ‘Techniques’ functions as a synonym for stratagems, keeping the coding unchanged."
278742000,Transintestinal approach (qualifier value),Transintestinal approach,"The entry explicitly names the procedural access route as a transintestinal approach, indicating passage through the intestine. The main concept is an approach qualifier, not a procedure itself. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. This maps precisely to 278742000 because it denotes the approach via the intestine without introducing segment-specific detail (e.g., colon or duodenum) or additional attributes. Parent concepts like generic 'Approach' are too broad, and child/sibling concepts such as 'Transcolonic approach' or 'Transgastric approach' are too specific and not indicated here."
249932008,Lower facial weakness (finding),Motor deficit—lower facial weakness,"This notes a motor deficit specifically characterized as weakness in the lower face, fitting the Clinical finding Lower facial weakness (SCTID 249932008). The term does not add attributes of side, cause, or timing. A parent concept like Facial weakness is less precise, and children implying paralysis or different facial regions would miscode the entry. It is distinct from facial droop, which describes appearance rather than strength."
224631005,Girls boarding school (environment),Boarding school for girls,"This formulation explicitly identifies a boarding school serving girls, aligning with Girls boarding school (environment), SCTID 224631005. Category: Environment. It captures both necessary attributes: boarding and girls-only. Using the parent Boarding school (environment) would lose the sex restriction, while Girls school (environment) would omit the boarding/residential component. ""For girls"" is a direct, clinically equivalent phrasing without added qualifiers."
1359985003,Tap water (specimen),Specimen collected: tap water,"The collection note states the specimen collected is tap water, aligning with Tap water (specimen) SCTID 1359985003 in the Specimen category. Collection wording is procedural context without altering the specimen identity. It does not better fit parent water specimens or any alternative water source sibling concepts."
860719001,No scar of retina following laser photocoagulation (situation),No retinal scar noted after prior laser photocoagulation.,"This statement documents a negative retinal scar finding in the context that laser photocoagulation has already been performed. The concepts are the negated retinal scarring (no scar) and the post–laser photocoagulation situation. This is a Situation with explicit context, and SCTID 860719001 is the most precise code. Using a broader parent without the post-procedure qualifier or any sibling indicating presence would miscode. “Prior” conveys the same post-procedure context as “following,” without adding extraneous attributes."
223820009,Chios (geographic location),Chios [island],Bracketing “[island]” clarifies the type of place without altering the core referent. The main concept is the island of Chios; category: Geographic location (Location). This maps to SCTID 223820009. It excludes the city or regional unit interpretations and is more specific than parent locations. The bracketed descriptor does not introduce clinical attributes; it is a form of semantic disambiguation consistent with the intended concept.
703852005,Narrative comment section (record artifact),Narrative comment section in progress note,"The entry refers to the narrative comment section within a progress note, which is a contextual placement of the same record artifact. It introduces no clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and matches 703852005 precisely. A general “notes section” or a different sibling like “assessment and plan section” would not capture the specific narrative comment section. The phrasing is a safe paraphrase that preserves the intended concept."
445672005,Duplicate report (record artifact),Duplicate report in chart,"The entry conveys that within the clinical chart a report exists as a duplicate, which aligns with 'Duplicate report (record artifact)' SCTID 445672005. Main concept: a duplicated report entry; Category: Record artifact. The location context ('in chart') does not change the artifact’s identity and adds no attributes like type, cause, or timing. Choosing a broader parent concept would lose the specificity to 'report,' and siblings such as 'Duplicate document' or 'Duplicate entry' are not as precise because the text names the object a 'report'. The synonym preserves equivalence to the preferred term."
48612002,Echeneis naucrates (organism),Cataloged as Echeneis naucrates,"This entry indicates cataloging under the species Echeneis naucrates, which remains purely an organism reference. It maps to the SNOMED CT Organism category and specifically to code 48612002. The species-level designation avoids parent concepts (genus/family) and does not infer sibling species or clinical attributes."
737434004,Major depressive disorder clinical management plan (record artifact),Care plan: Major depressive disorder,"This phrasing indicates a care plan pertaining specifically to major depressive disorder, conveying a record of planned clinical management. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and 737434004 is appropriate because it captures a clinical management plan focused on MDD. It is not merely an unspecified care plan (parent concept) nor the disorder itself. The term 'care plan' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'clinical management plan' and does not add new attributes such as severity or episode type."
1208405007,Grand Turk (geographic location),Residence: Grand Turk,"‘Residence’ conveys context, but the entry’s coded value is still the geographic location Grand Turk. The main concept captured is the place Grand Turk. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). This fits SCTID 1208405007 precisely. Broader parent areas (e.g., Turks and Caicos Islands) or narrower localities within Grand Turk would not reflect the exact wording. No clinical attributes like severity, timeframe, or associated conditions are introduced, only the place name."
7203000,Hemileuca (organism),Reference organism: Hemileuca,"The entry designates Hemileuca as the referenced organism, without species, lifecycle, or clinical details, indicating the genus-level concept. Main concept: Hemileuca genus. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Hemileuca (organism) [7203000] is the most precise code. Parent taxa are too broad; child species would be too narrow. The reference context is informational and does not introduce attributes beyond the organism name, so the genus concept is appropriate."
250900006,Stapedial reflex threshold (observable entity),Audiology: stapedial reflex threshold,"The context 'Audiology' situates the observable within its typical clinical domain without altering the concept. The core concept remains the threshold of the stapedial reflex. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This maps to SCTID 250900006; parent categories would be too generic, and sibling concepts such as presence/absence or decay would not match the specified threshold parameter."
417462006,Order Acidimicrobiales (organism),Taxonomic order Acidimicrobiales,"The entry explicitly states the taxonomic rank (order) and the name Acidimicrobiales, which maps directly to SNOMED CT concept 417462006 in the Organism hierarchy. It presents no detection, disease, or clinical attributes, only classification. Choosing a parent such as 'Actinobacteria' would be too broad, whereas child taxa below the order (families, genera, species) would be too specific; sibling orders within the same class would be incorrect. 'Taxonomic order' is a synonymous descriptor that preserves the intended organism concept granularity."
450719005,Mastoid region structure (body structure),Anatomical region: mastoid region,"This phrase labels the mastoid region as an anatomical region, specifying the correct topographic entity without additional qualifiers. The concept is the mastoid region structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It avoids mapping to a parent like head/ear region or to child/sibling concepts like mastoid process or postauricular region, making SCTID 450719005 the exact match."
346415002,Enteral and supplement feeds (product),Enteral/supplement feed products provided,"The entry documents provision of the product category “enteral/supplement feed products,” which maps to SNOMED CT Product 346415002. The phrasing is a synonymic paraphrase of the preferred term, keeping the same scope and not introducing composition, brand, or patient group attributes. Parent categories lack specificity; child categories (e.g., single-type formulas) are not stated. This is not a procedure (no administration details), so the product concept code is most precise."
22232009,Hospital (environment),Clinical setting: hospital,"The entry identifies the clinical setting as hospital, directly corresponding to Hospital (environment) [22232009]. No reference is made to inpatient/outpatient status or specific units, so child concepts are not triggered. A broader parent like Healthcare facility environment would be too general, and organizational or physical-object interpretations are not intended. As a synonymous phrasing, it remains a clean match to 22232009."
420620005,Push - dosing instruction imperative (qualifier value),Pharmacy record instruction verb: Push,"This entry documents that the pharmacy record lists “Push” as the instruction verb. It corresponds to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value Push - dosing instruction imperative (420620005). The pharmacy context does not imply administration route or rate, keeping the focus on the imperative verb only. A parent concept would be less specific, and sibling imperatives such as Use or Apply would not match the verb, thus making this concept the appropriate choice."
74240004,Structure of tubal end of ovary (body structure),Tubal end—ovary,"A typographic dash does not change meaning; the entry identifies the ovary’s tubal end only, without laterality, condition, or procedural statements. Category: Body structure. Structure of tubal end of ovary (74240004) is the precise match. Mapping to the parent ovary structure would be overly broad, while siblings (e.g., uterine end of ovary or fimbrial end of fallopian tube) are not appropriate because the term explicitly situates the end on the ovary and on the tubal side."
224031006,Banks island (geographic location),Imaging report location: Banks Island,"The entry documents the location term within an imaging report as Banks Island. The concept to be coded is the geographic location; the report context is metadata. Category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224031006 is the specific code for this named island. Using a parent location category would lose specificity, and siblings would denote other islands. The framing does not introduce clinical severity, timing, or etiology; it preserves the unambiguous identification of the place."
399407000,Specimen from ureter obtained by ureterectomy (specimen),Operative note: ureter specimen collected during ureterectomy,"The operative context specifies a ureter specimen collected during ureterectomy, which aligns with the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 399407000. It is more precise than parent concepts without a stated method and does not align with sibling concepts involving biopsy or other procedures. The statement avoids introducing additional attributes that would change the code selection."
731080002,Entire deep inguinal lymph node (body structure),Anatomic site: deep inguinal lymph node,"This documentation statement references the deep inguinal lymph node strictly as an anatomical site, with no added clinical attributes (e.g., laterality, pathology, or procedure). The concept is a Body structure, and SCTID 731080002 is the most precise match. The wording does not imply a group of nodes, a superficial node, or a named deep node; hence parent or sibling alternatives are less accurate. The contextual phrase “Anatomic site:” does not alter code selection; it remains the same structure as in the FSN."
1255598005,Presence of regression of primary malignant neoplasm of ovary after neoadjuvant antineoplastic therapy (observable entity),Surgical candidate note: Primary ovarian malignancy demonstrates regression present after neoadjuvant antineoplastic therapy,"The note asserts regression is present in a primary ovarian malignancy and that this is after neoadjuvant antineoplastic therapy, a preoperative context. This represents an Observable entity and maps to SCTID 1255598005. It does not include degree of regression or specify a treatment modality beyond antineoplastic therapy, avoiding child concepts like complete response or chemotherapy-specific codes and excluding siblings like absence of regression."
88164008,Exhaustion due to exposure (finding),Exhaustion from exposure,"This entry expresses exhaustion with the causal preposition 'from exposure', without further modifiers such as exposure type or duration. It belongs to the Clinical finding category. 'From exposure' is commonly used to indicate causality and is synonymous with 'due to exposure'. SNOMED CT 88164008 is the exact fit. A generic exhaustion code would be insufficient because the cause is stated, and any child specifying particular exposures would be too narrow for this wording."
368441006,Cervical contraceptive cap (physical object),Female contraceptive cervical cap,"This entry indicates a cervical cap used for female contraception, aligning precisely with the cervical contraceptive cap device. It falls under Physical object in SNOMED CT; code 368441006 is the most accurate. The addition of 'female' is inherent to the device’s intended anatomy and does not add separate clinical attributes, nor does it imply use or presence, so it remains correctly mapped."
1155870001,Anatomic location directly invaded by primary malignant neoplasm of oral mucosa (observable entity),Site invaded by primary oral mucosa cancer (direct invasion),"This text denotes the observable variable for the anatomic site directly invaded by the primary oral mucosa cancer. The parenthetical clarifies the invasion is direct, distinguishing it from metastasis or indirect involvement. The observable entity SCTID 1155870001 is the most precise match; disorder codes or observables about extent/grade would be inappropriate. Using “cancer” as a synonym for malignant neoplasm is acceptable and does not change the concept. No specific invaded site or additional qualifiers are asserted."
1351968003,Free-standing pathology facility (environment),Stand-alone pathology lab,"The entry describes a pathology lab that is stand-alone, a common synonym for free-standing. This is a facility/environment concept with the explicit qualifier of independence. It fits the SNOMED CT concept “Free-standing pathology facility” rather than the generic parent “Pathology facility,” which lacks the standalone attribute, and it avoids siblings that imply hospital-based services. “Lab” is an accepted shorthand for laboratory and does not change the meaning. No added attributes are present, so SCTID 1351968003 is the most precise code."
870491000,Product containing growth hormone receptor antagonist (product),Med order for growth hormone receptor antagonist,"The main concept is a medication order for a product containing a growth hormone receptor antagonist, falling under Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). While the context is an order, the item being ordered is the product class itself. No specific ingredient, dose form, or brand is named, so it aligns with SCTID 870491000 rather than child concepts. It is more specific than parent classes by identifying the GH receptor antagonism."
1365794008,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with mandible postured forward (record artifact),"Image review: extraoral photograph of left hemiface, mandible forward; record artifact.","An image review documents an extraoral photograph of the left hemiface with the mandible forward, declared a record artifact. Category: Record artifact. 'Hemiface' and 'mandible forward' are equivalent synonyms to 'left half of face' and 'mandible postured forward.' This corresponds exactly to SCTID 1365794008. Choosing a parent artifact without these specifics or a sibling with right-sided or full-face coverage would not match the described attributes, and this is not a clinical finding."
230128007,"Passive movements of the hand, function (observable entity)",Observable entity: function of passive motion in the hand,Explicitly calling it an observable emphasizes the category and identifies the property of hand function under passive motion without implying measurement values. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The passive qualifier excludes active movement function and differentiates it from broader hand function or specific range-of-motion observables. The synonymy of 'motion' and 'movement' does not change code selection. SCTID 230128007 is the most specific match.
165346000,Laboratory test result abnormal (situation),Laboratory results flagged as abnormal,"This report-style entry indicates that laboratory results were flagged abnormal, without specifying which results or the nature of the abnormality. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 165346000 (Situation with explicit context: laboratory test result abnormal). Mapping to broader abnormal investigation results would be imprecise, and mapping to children such as high/low or specific test types would add specificity not present. The 'flagged' wording is a reporting convention and does not alter the clinical concept or require a different code."
411959005,Parietaria officinalis specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Panel reagent: Parietaria officinalis diagnostic allergen extract,"Refers to the single-allergen diagnostic extract for Parietaria officinalis as part of a testing panel, but still denotes the specific product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This is consistent with SCTID 411959005. A parent concept would not specify the allergen, while siblings for other species or for therapeutic extracts are inappropriate. The entry does not imply a mixture; it remains a specific single-allergen diagnostic product."
259490004,Peroxisomal oxidase (substance),Peroxisomal oxidase,"The entry names the substance exactly as the SNOMED CT preferred term, identifying the enzyme class located in peroxisomes without adding attributes such as activity, level, or specificity. The concept is a Substance, and SCTID 259490004 is the most precise match because it represents peroxisomal oxidase as a generic enzyme substance. Mapping to a parent like “Oxidase (substance)” would be overly broad and would lose the peroxisomal localization. Mapping to children (e.g., specific peroxisomal oxidases such as acyl-CoA oxidase) would add unwanted specificity not present in the wording. Similarly, observable entities like “oxidase activity” are inappropriate because no measurement or functional attribute is stated."
216313004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, home (environment)",Location of accident/poisoning: private residence,"The entry assigns the place-of-occurrence for an accident or poisoning to a private residence, which is semantically equivalent to home, mapping to Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, home (environment). The category is context-dependent. No mechanism, severity, or timing is added. Parent concepts lacking a place are insufficiently specific, and siblings like street, school, or residential institution do not match. “Private residence” is a safe synonym for home and does not alter code selection."
703442003,Gradient strip susceptibility test technique (qualifier value),Technique: gradient strip antimicrobial susceptibility test,"This entry conveys a technique attribute—specifically the gradient strip method—for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. It fits the Qualifier value category and aligns with SCTID 703442003. The wording does not add results, organisms, or brand information, avoiding drift to parent 'susceptibility test technique' or to sibling methods like disc diffusion. 'Technique' and 'method' are clinically equivalent descriptors for the same qualifier and do not change the code selection, supporting the precise match to the gradient strip susceptibility test technique."
217094006,Fall from steps (event),Incident described as fall from steps,"Main concept: incident characterized by fall from steps. There are no added details about time, place, or sequelae. SNOMED CT category: Event. The exact fit is 'Fall from steps (event)' SCTID 217094006, as the incident’s defining feature is the fall from steps. Using a more general fall code would omit specificity, and other fall types (e.g., from balcony or ladder) are not described. The wording is a neutral paraphrase that preserves equivalence."
223633000,European country (geographic location),European state (country),"The word 'state' is commonly used as a synonym for 'country' in international contexts; the parenthetical clarifies the intended level, and 'European' restricts the geography. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location/Qualifier value). This maps to 223633000 since it specifies a country within Europe without indicating a specific member. It excludes the parent concept (Europe) and avoids child concepts (named countries). The synonym does not add attributes."
707910003,Ribonucleic acid of Influenza A virus H6 (substance),Genomic ribonucleic acid of Influenza A H6,"This entry designates the genomic ribonucleic acid of Influenza A H6, a substance. The precise SNOMED CT match is 707910003. It avoids clinical interpretation, presence, or procedural context, so it is not a finding or test. The explicit H6 subtype makes it more specific than the parent Influenza A RNA concept and excludes sibling subtypes. ‘Genomic ribonucleic acid’ is an acceptable synonym for the virus’s RNA, maintaining equivalent meaning."
16209291000119109,Brain cyst fluid specimen (specimen),Specimen: brain cyst fluid,"This is a standard laboratory or pathology label indicating the specimen type as brain cyst fluid. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The phrasing aligns with 16209291000119109 by specifying both the anatomical context (brain) and the specimen material (cyst fluid), avoiding scope creep into broader or narrower specimen types. It does not imply procedures or additional attributes, keeping the mapping exact."
113485006,Evansella vedderi (organism),Binomial name: Evansella vedderi,"Referencing the binomial name Evansella vedderi clearly identifies the species-level organism only. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, mapping to concept 113485006. Parent or sibling organism concepts would misrepresent the specified species. No clinical attributes (presence, infection, site, severity, timing) are included, so disorder or finding categories are not applicable."
467600008,Cochlear implant system electrode array assembly (physical object),Follow-up device section—cochlear implant system electrode array assembly,"The follow-up section references the cochlear implant system electrode array assembly, which is categorized as a Physical object. The context does not add presence, status, or laterality; it merely names the device component, aligning with SCTID 467600008. Parent concepts (entire implant system) or sibling components (processor, receiver) would not match the wording. A generic electrode array would be underspecified. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym and does not change code selection."
770576004,Prevention of delirium care plan (record artifact),Delirium prevention care plan exists,"The statement asserts the presence of a care plan that targets delirium prevention, emphasizing existence without procedural action. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 770576004 matches exactly because it encodes a care plan for preventing delirium. Broader care plan codes would omit the preventive delirium focus, and alternatives like treatment plans or screening plans would be inaccurate. The phrasing introduces no new attributes and aligns directly with the concept’s intent."
411681002,Echinochloa crus-galli diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergy testing material—Echinochloa crus-galli extract,"The entry identifies material used in allergy testing and specifies it is an extract from Echinochloa crus-galli, indicating a diagnostic allergen product. SNOMED CT category: Product. 'Testing material' is a synonymous descriptor for a diagnostic allergen extract reagent, without adding attributes like method or dose. The species naming pins the code to 411681002 and avoids mapping to generic or other grass allergen extracts."
13851000181101,Halobacillus yeomjeoni (organism),Organism label: Halobacillus yeomjeoni,"Labeling the organism as Halobacillus yeomjeoni states the species identity. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Organism category, with the exact concept SCTID 13851000181101. The entry avoids introducing any clinical or taxonomic modifiers beyond species, so parents (genus, higher taxa) are insufficiently specific, and siblings or children are not indicated."
1290246003,Histologic grade of neuroblastoma (observable entity),Report field: neuroblastoma histologic grade,"As a report field designation, the entry identifies the observable attribute to capture: histologic grade of neuroblastoma. This is an Observable entity, best matched to SCTID 1290246003. Procedural or diagnostic process codes are not suitable because the text specifies the data element, and broader histologic grade concepts are less precise."
217685001,Puncture by sea urchin spine (event),Patient reports sea urchin spine puncture,"This patient-reported phrasing conveys that the event was a puncture caused by a sea urchin spine; it does not suggest a diagnosis, body site, timing, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 217685001 matches the described external cause mechanism and agent. Broader parents like 'contact with marine animal' lack specificity, and disorder concepts such as 'puncture wound' are not explicitly stated. Sibling concepts oriented to stings or bites do not align with 'spine puncture.'"
256128009,2-ethylhexyl acrylate (substance),Inventory item: 2-ethylhexyl acrylate,"Labeling it as an inventory item adds administrative context without altering the chemical identity of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. The SNOMED category is Substance. SCTID 256128009 is the exact match for the named compound; selecting a parent like acrylate esters or a different sibling (e.g., butyl acrylate) would be less specific. There is no implication of clinical use, exposure, or test result, so substance is correct."
22249002,Insect iridescent virus 8 (organism),Specimen library record notes Insect iridescent virus 8,"The text references a library record that notes the organism Insect iridescent virus 8, without stating detection, infection, or result status. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 22249002 is the most accurate code. Broader parent organism concepts would be less precise, and finding or disorder concepts would be inappropriate since no clinical state is described. The library-record context frames the naming but keeps the concept as the organism itself."
223497007,Geographical continent (geographic location),Spatial category set to continent,"This indicates that the spatial category for the location is continent, i.e., the continent class of geographic locations. It belongs to SNOMED CT’s Location (geographic location) category and maps to Geographical continent | 223497007. It remains generic to the class without naming a particular continent, avoiding children, and is more specific than the parent Geographic location. It does not suggest other location types, so siblings are less appropriate. The paraphrase maintains semantic equivalence and coding precision."
223563002,Mali (geographic location),Imaging site location: Mali,"The text records the imaging site’s location as “Mali.” The primary concept is the geographic place Mali. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The appropriate code is Mali (geographic location), SCTID 223563002, since the entry specifies the country. A parent like Geographic location or Country would be too general, and a child location within Mali is not indicated. The imaging context is a label; the codable content remains the place name."
13015001000119105,Lung cancer screening declined (situation),Lung cancer screening declined by patient,"This directly indicates that the patient declined lung cancer screening, captured as a Situation. The exact code is “Lung cancer screening declined (situation)” (13015001000119105). A broader parent such as “Cancer screening declined” does not specify the lung, and siblings concerning acceptance or other organ screening refusals would not match. The wording avoids adding modality, timing, or reasons."
736361009,Minor thoracic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Charted inpatient care plan for minor thoracic surgery,"“Charted” indicates documentation within the medical record; the artifact is an inpatient care plan tied to minor thoracic surgery. This is a Record artifact concept. It maps to SCTID 736361009 since it preserves both the inpatient context and minor thoracic surgery scope. It avoids referring to major surgery, outpatient settings, or more general care plans that would be parents or siblings."
787611004,Photographic image extraoral with mandible postured forward (record artifact),Extraoral facial image taken with the mandible in a forward position.,"This entry specifies an extraoral facial image and clearly states the mandible is in a forward position. The concept is an image metadata label, category Record artifact. It precisely maps to the SNOMED concept since it includes extraoral imaging and forward mandibular posture. Parent artifacts that do not specify posture are too general, and sibling artifacts for other positions or intraoral settings do not match. 'Forward position' is a direct paraphrase of 'postured forward' and does not change code selection."
285854004,Emotion (observable entity),Emotion discussed as an observable,"The phrase explicitly treats Emotion as an observable, aligning with SNOMED’s Observable entity category. SCTID 285854004 is appropriate because it denotes the construct, not a patient’s emotional state. It avoids emotional state findings and related observables like Mood or Affect. The discussion context does not add attributes and thus the general Emotion observable entity is the best fit."
127504005,Atypical Enterococcus (organism),Nonclassic Enterococcus (organism),"“Nonclassic” is a paraphrase consistent with the meaning of “atypical” and maintains the focus on the organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This wording remains semantically equivalent to “Atypical Enterococcus,” warranting code 127504005. No site, clinical status, species, or resistance is stated, thus broader or alternative organism concepts (parent or sibling) would not be as precise."
422680004,Battery entry (record artifact),Battery item in record,"This expresses a single recorded item belonging to a battery, which is a Record artifact. SCTID 422680004 is the best fit because it denotes the entry-level unit of a battery. The parent Battery (record artifact) would indicate the entire grouped artifact, not the individual entry, and panel-based siblings are not indicated. 'Item in record' adds only location context without introducing clinical attributes, preserving semantic equivalence."
730345004,Entire capsule of interphalangeal joint (body structure),Patient education: discussing the entire interphalangeal joint capsule,"Within an education context, the entry still denotes the entire capsule of the interphalangeal joint. Main concept: whole joint capsule anatomy. Category: Body structure. SNOMED CT 730345004 is the best match, as the statement references the complete capsule without specifying PIP/DIP or extremity. Parent concepts lack the whole-structure emphasis; child/sibling concepts introduce extra specificity not mentioned."
1285103009,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of upper urinary tract at surgical margin in ureterectomy specimen (observable entity),Is primary upper tract malignancy present at the ureterectomy margin?,"Posed as a question, this expresses the same observable: the presence (yes/no) of a primary malignant neoplasm in the upper urinary tract at the margin of a ureterectomy specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It avoids a result, so finding concepts like tumor at margin are inappropriate. Generic margin status observables or those not specifying specimen/tumor type would be less specific, and histology- or subsite-specific children are too narrow. The wording corresponds to SCTID 1285103009."
1304306004,Impaired ability to distinguish internal mental experiences from external reality (finding),Blurred boundary between inner experience and external reality,"This phrasing describes a blurred boundary between internal experience and the external world, which directly reflects impaired reality testing. It is a Clinical finding and aligns with SNOMED CT SCTID 1304306004. No causation, severity, or temporal details are introduced, ensuring specificity to the concept. Parent categories are overly broad, and sibling concepts like hallucinations, delusions, or derealization add specific phenomenology not asserted here. The paraphrase is clinically safe and semantically equivalent to the preferred term, warranting the same code."
242668002,Asphyxia by unchewed food bolus in air passages (event),Discharge summary: asphyxia by unchewed food bolus in air passages,"The discharge summary entry captures an event of asphyxia caused by an unchewed food bolus in the air passages. Category: Event. SCTID 242668002 is exact because it includes both the asphyxia outcome and the specific mechanism/location. More general parents like “Asphyxia” omit the cause, and siblings such as “Choking” or “Airway foreign body” are less precise because they do not mandate asphyxia. The documentation context is neutral with respect to coding; no new attributes are introduced."
1003622002,Measured quantity of intake of cholesterol in 24 hours (observable entity),Measured amount of cholesterol intake in 24 hours,"This wording conveys a quantified amount of cholesterol consumed over a 24-hour period, meeting the observable attributes of intake (dietary), substance (cholesterol), and timeframe (24 h). It corresponds specifically to the Observable entity SCTID 1003622002. Broader or sibling concepts either lack the timeframe, the measured qualifier, or the specific nutrient. ‘Measured amount’ is a clinically equivalent synonym to ‘measured quantity’ without adding units or values."
262450004,Mozdok (qualifier value),MOZDOK,"Uppercase rendering of the place name Mozdok still indicates the same geographic entity with no added details. The SNOMED category is Qualifier value, and the precise code is Mozdok (qualifier value), SCTID 262450004. No additional qualifiers such as country, administrative level, or specific site are present, so broader parent concepts or different siblings (e.g., districts) do not apply. Case variation is a display choice and does not alter the concept."
414591000,Leifsonia aquatica (organism),Leifsonia aquatica bacterium,"The term identifies the organism Leifsonia aquatica and notes that it is a bacterium, which is consistent with its taxonomy. This remains an Organism concept and correctly maps to Leifsonia aquatica (414591000). Adding 'bacterium' does not introduce new clinical attributes; it is a clinically safe synonym clarifying classification. Broader bacterial or genus-level codes would be less precise, and strain-level concepts are not indicated."
789130005,Photographic image with mouth partially opened position and teeth apart (record artifact),"Photographic image (record artifact): mouth partially opened, teeth apart","This statement explicitly frames the content as a photographic image classified as a record artifact, with the mouth partially opened and teeth apart. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the entry aligns exactly with SCTID 789130005. Choosing a parent such as Photographic image (record artifact) alone would omit the mouth/teeth posture, and sibling concepts featuring different mouth opening or teeth contact are not appropriate. The wording preserves equivalence to the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
16211331000119100,Specimen obtained by cystoprostatectomy (specimen),Post-cystoprostatectomy specimen submitted,"This entry describes submission of a specimen following cystoprostatectomy, with the source procedure explicitly stated. The main concept is a specimen; timing language (“post-”) indicates normal workflow but does not add a clinical attribute beyond the source procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It fits SCTID 16211331000119100 exactly, whereas a parent like “Submitted specimen” is nonspecific and a sibling like “Specimen from radical cystoprostatectomy” would be inappropriately narrow as ‘radical’ is not specified. The wording is a compliant paraphrase that preserves the core concept."
353352001,Gluten-free cracker bread (product),Gluten-free crispbread,"The documented concept is gluten-free crispbread, which is a clinically accepted synonym for gluten-free cracker bread and fits the SNOMED CT Product category. Crispbread and cracker bread are interchangeable terms in food nomenclature; the gluten-free qualifier is preserved. A parent concept such as crispbread/cracker bread without the gluten-free attribute is less specific, and siblings like gluten-free bread or gluten-free crackers would misrepresent the product type. Therefore, SCTID 353352001 is the most accurate code."
228781003,External beam radiation therapy beam energy (observable entity),Radiotherapy plan parameter: external beam beam energy,"This entry situates beam energy within treatment planning for radiotherapy, explicitly referring to the external beam. It indicates an Observable entity parameter, matching SNOMED CT 228781003. It excludes attributes such as dose, fractionation, or modality (IMRT/VMAT), which would point to sibling concepts, and is more specific than generic beam energy parent concepts due to the external beam therapy context."
242647003,Bite of pubic louse (event),Bite from crab louse,"This entry identifies an event caused by a crab louse, the common name for Pthirus pubis, without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event, matching SCTID 242647003. More general or different-organism bites are inappropriate, and this does not suggest a disorder state. The synonym 'crab louse' maintains the same clinical meaning as 'pubic louse.'"
266882009,No family history: Ischemic heart disease (situation),FHx: no ischemic heart disease.,"“FHx” denotes family history, and the statement negates ischemic heart disease within that context. The category is Situation with explicit context. This maps most precisely to 266882009 since it documents the absence of familial IHD. It does not specify subcategories like coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, which would be narrower child concepts, nor does it generalize to heart disease broadly, which would suggest a parent concept. The shorthand does not change the clinical meaning."
773507005,Gynecology oncology care plan (record artifact),GYN oncology plan of care,Using the common abbreviation 'GYN' for gynecology coupled with 'plan of care' denotes the same record artifact in the gynecologic oncology domain. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It precisely matches SCTID 773507005 and is not adequately represented by broader care plan concepts or non-gynecologic oncology variants. The abbreviation preserves clinical equivalence without adding attributes.
285126008,Corrosive environment (environment),Corrosive ambient environment,"The entry declares the ambient environment as corrosive, with no mention of cause, severity, timing, or specific setting. It aligns with the Environment category and the specific concept Corrosive environment (environment), SCTID 285126008. More general parents would be less precise, and specific siblings/children such as Acidic environment or Hazardous environment would introduce details not present. ‘Ambient’ functions as a neutral descriptor and does not change the concept or code."
122591000,Serum specimen from blood product (specimen),Blood product serum specimen,"The entry explicitly denotes a serum specimen whose source is a blood product. The main medical concept is a specimen, with the attribute of origin specified as a blood product. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Specimen category. SCTID 122591000 (Serum specimen from blood product) is the most precise match because it captures both the specimen type (serum) and its source (blood product). A generic parent like 'Serum specimen' would omit the blood product origin, and a broader sibling like 'Specimen from blood product' would fail to specify serum. No additional attributes such as timing or associated tests are introduced, and 'serum specimen' is a clinically equivalent phrasing."
450874000,Collection of first stream urine specimen (procedure),First part of urine stream sample obtained,"This statement indicates that the sample was obtained from the first part of the urine stream, explicitly defining the stream portion and confirming the collection procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It aligns with SCTID 450874000 and is more specific than parent concepts. It avoids midstream and catheterization references, keeping it distinct from sibling procedures. The synonym “sample” is equivalent to “specimen.”"
1217279005,Telephone order (record artifact),Order originated by telephone,"This entry makes clear the order originated through telephone communication as documented in the record. No other attributes such as the type of order or timeframe are given. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The explicit telephone modality corresponds to Telephone order (record artifact) SCTID 1217279005. Parent concepts are too broad because they omit modality, and siblings (e.g., verbal face-to-face, electronic) do not match. The absence of order content avoids implying any child concept."
1961000181108,Caballeronia catudaia (organism),Caballeronia catudaia,"The entry states the exact binomial species name without any added qualifiers. The main concept is the organism Caballeronia catudaia. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This precisely matches SCTID 1961000181108, which represents the species itself. Broader parent concepts (e.g., the genus Caballeronia) would be too general, and any strain-level or subspecies child concepts are not mentioned. No sibling species are referenced. The simple species name is the most accurate and unambiguous expression of the organism concept."
424836000,Assessment section (record artifact),Assessment section — provider note,"The phrase identifies the Assessment section of a provider-authored note, focusing on the record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 424836000 is the most precise code, denoting the Assessment section. Generic section codes are too broad, and siblings such as Objective section or Plan section are different entities. No clinical evaluation or impression content is implied, avoiding misclassification into procedure/finding concepts."
363892006,Psychodynamic features (observable entity),Psychodynamic features identified during assessment,"This line indicates identification of the observable entity during a clinical assessment, still referring to 'psychodynamic features' generically and precisely. SCTID 363892006 is appropriate because it denotes observable psychodynamic characteristics. It does not imply a procedure code (assessment itself) or a clinical finding; instead it names the observed feature category. Parent/sibling concepts are less accurate, and no additional attributes are introduced."
1336132003,Plain X-ray of trachea with contrast (procedure),Tracheal contrast plain film X-ray,"The entry specifies tracheal imaging via plain film X-ray with contrast, directly matching the concept. Main elements: trachea, plain film radiography, contrast. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It does not suggest fluoroscopy, CT, or include bronchi/larynx, thus avoiding sibling misclassification. The synonyms used ('plain film' and 'contrast') are clinically equivalent and maintain the same code."
846666005,Prison health center (environment),Encounter location: prison health center,"This line specifies the encounter location environment as the prison health center. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps precisely to SCTID 846666005 because it indicates both a prison context and the health center type. Parent concepts that separate prison or health center alone are less specific, and sibling concepts with different facility types would be inaccurate. The 'Encounter location' label is contextual and does not add clinical attributes beyond the environment."
251852001,Total fluid input (observable entity),Total fluid input,"The main concept stated is the total amount of fluid taken into the patient, expressed as a single observable measure. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Observable entity. The phrasing precisely matches SCTID 251852001 (Total fluid input), which represents the aggregate intake of fluids without specifying time, route, or units. Parent concepts like general “Fluid intake” would be less specific, while sibling concepts such as “Total fluid output” or “Net fluid balance” introduce different measurements. No child concept (e.g., route-specific intake) is implied, making this the most accurate code."
407625007,Epilepsy suspected (situation),Impression: suspected epilepsy,"‘Impression’ in clinical documentation conveys the clinician’s interpretive view, here indicating suspected epilepsy. The main concept is epilepsy with a suspicion attribute. This clearly maps to a Situation and matches Epilepsy suspected (situation) SCTID 407625007. Parent Epilepsy (disorder) would be incorrect due to lack of confirmation. Related concepts such as seizure suspected or investigative contexts are less precise because the impression is specifically suspicion of epilepsy."
431776009,Swab of surgical drain (specimen),Specimen received: swab of surgical drain,This receipt statement designates the specimen received as a swab of a surgical drain. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 431776009 because the specimen modality (swab) and source (surgical drain) are clearly stated. More general parents or siblings/children focusing on different specimen materials (fluid) or sites (drain insertion area) would not reflect the exact wording here.
78419005,Antennarius scaber (organism),Antennarius scaber species name confirmed,"The entry confirms the species name Antennarius scaber, clearly identifying the organism at the species level. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The best match is 78419005 because the exact binomial is affirmed; parent or sibling concepts would be less specific or incorrect. 'Species name confirmed' is a verification context, not an added clinical attribute."
449007006,Reason for discharge section (record artifact),FHIR composition section: Reason for discharge,"The entry specifies a section within a FHIR Composition labeled ‘Reason for discharge,’ which is a record artifact. No details of the reason are included, only the presence of the section. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 449007006 best fits this defined section. Using a general composition section code would be too broad, while sibling sections (e.g., discharge diagnosis or disposition) represent different document content elements. The phrasing is semantically equivalent and maintains the same concept."
778072006,Dorsal closing wedge osteotomy of calcaneus (procedure),"Dorsal closing wedge osteotomy, calcaneus","This is a concise listing of a Procedure: dorsal closing wedge osteotomy at the calcaneus. It includes the necessary specifics—site (calcaneus), osteotomy type (closing wedge), and dorsal orientation—matching SCTID 778072006. A parent 'Osteotomy of calcaneus' would be too broad, and sibling codes for opening wedge or lateral/medial closing wedge osteotomies do not align with 'dorsal closing wedge.' No laterality, timing, or additional technique is implied."
164978006,Mantoux test not done (situation),PPD test was not performed.,"The entry indicates the PPD (Mantoux) test was not performed, with no mention of reasons or timing. It fits the Situation category. SCTID 164978006 Mantoux test not done is the precise match as PPD test directly refers to the Mantoux method. Parent concepts such as Tuberculin test not done are broader, and sibling concepts with outcomes or reasons are not appropriate. 'Was not performed' is an acceptable paraphrase that preserves the concept."
470361000,"General-purpose suction system, vacuum (physical object)",General suction vacuum system (medical),"The phrase denotes a general (non-specialized) vacuum system for suction within medical settings. Main concept: general-purpose vacuum suction system. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It is congruent with SCTID 470361000, not drifting into parent generic suction objects or child items like handheld suction devices. The parenthetical 'medical' provides contextual setting without adding device attributes, keeping the selection precise."
46783000,Wallaby (organism),Wallaby identified,"The entry indicates that the organism identified is ""wallaby"" without adding details about methods, specimens, or relationships. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Wallaby (organism) [46783000] is the exact match, representing the organism concept for wallaby. Parent (broader) concepts such as Marsupial or Mammal would be insufficiently specific, and sibling organisms like Kangaroo are not the same. No species-level subtype is mentioned, making child concepts inappropriate. The verb ""identified"" does not alter the organism concept."
223403002,"Saint Martin, French part (geographic location)",Saint-Martin (French part),"The hyphenated form ‘Saint-Martin’ is a common orthographic variant and, with ‘French part,’ it denotes the French side of the island specifically. Category: Geographic location (Qualifier value). It maps directly to 223403002 and avoids broader or different locations. Using ‘French part’ rules out the sibling concept (Sint Maarten) and prevents mapping to the parent concept of the entire island. The entry conveys only the location name, without any added attributes, and is appropriate for documentation contexts where the place must be identified precisely."
163200004,Entire intervertebral disc space of third cervical vertebra (body structure),Entire disc space at the level of the third cervical vertebra,"The phrase 'at the level of the third cervical vertebra' identifies C3, and 'disc space' clarifies the intervertebral disc space; 'entire' ensures the whole structure is intended. This is a Body structure entry mapping to SCTID 163200004. Parents without level specificity are too broad, and siblings specifying C2–C3 or C3–C4 are not indicated here. It does not shift to the disc itself or any partial region, preserving accuracy."
69620002,Daily (qualifier value),Daily basis,"The phrase 'Daily basis' is a common clinical and lay synonym indicating an every-day frequency. The main concept is a temporal frequency qualifier, with no dosage, timing-of-day, or other attributes included. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Qualifier value Daily (qualifier value) [69620002]. Using more general parent nodes like 'Temporal frequency' would reduce specificity, and sibling values such as 'Weekly basis' or 'Every other day' are clearly not intended. The paraphrase does not alter meaning, so 69620002 remains the precise match."
275937001,Family history of malignant neoplasm (situation),Family history: malignant neoplasm present,"The phrase indicates that malignant neoplasm (cancer) is present within the family history, with no site, type, or relative specified, which matches the general concept. This is a Situation with explicit context. The appropriate code is 275937001. Concepts about benign neoplasms or personal history are incorrect, and more specific family history of particular cancers would be over-coding given the wording."
774202005,Special care baby care plan (record artifact),Special care baby POC (plan of care),"“POC” is a common abbreviation for Plan of Care; specifying “special care baby” keeps the artifact scoped to the special care nursery context. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 774202005 is the correct code for a special care baby care plan artifact. Parent concepts like Care plan (record artifact) are too broad, and sibling entries such as NICU POC refer to different levels of care. The abbreviation expands to the same concept and does not add attributes; it remains a plan document."
61861001,Speed of associations (finding),Mental associations speed,"This synonym indicates the speed at which mental associations occur, presenting the same attribute as the preferred term without any qualifiers. It is a Clinical finding and should be coded to “Speed of associations (finding)” (61861001). Broader thought process findings or different attributes (e.g., coherence, content) are less suitable. Using ‘mental’ instead of ‘thought’ is a clinically equivalent paraphrase and does not affect code selection."
1365802007,Photographic intraoral direct image of frontal view with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Front-facing intraoral direct dental photograph with centric occlusion,"This denotes a dental photographic record artifact: intraoral, direct, front-facing (frontal) orientation, with teeth in centric occlusion. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 1365802007 best applies because it contains all relevant qualifiers—photographic intraoral direct image, frontal view, teeth in centric occlusion. Parent concepts lacking occlusion or direct-capture detail are insufficiently specific; sibling artifacts like lateral or mirror-based images would not match. The terms “front-facing” and “dental photograph” are acceptable synonyms that maintain the same concept."
411407008,Color Developer CD 2 (product),Color Developer CD-2,"This orthographic variant with a hyphen ('CD-2') still names the exact same product entity. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The inclusion of 'CD-2' maintains the specificity required for SNOMED CT 411407008, avoiding mapping to a general color developer product or other CD variants. No attributes like brand, lot, dosage form, or timing are added, so parent, child, or sibling concepts are less appropriate."
73711000119107,History of cholangiocarcinoma (situation),Patient reports previous cholangiocarcinoma,"The phrase identifies cholangiocarcinoma as a prior condition, with the documentation context being patient-reported. This aligns with the Situation concept “History of cholangiocarcinoma” (73711000119107). It does not introduce location, staging, activity, or treatment details, so parent concepts like general cancer history are too broad and sibling or child concepts indicating subtype or active disease are not supported by the wording."
284648005,Dietary intake finding (finding),Imaging report notes a dietary intake finding,"Although the context is an imaging report, the entry only states that a dietary intake finding is noted, without clinical qualifiers. It remains a Clinical finding focused on dietary intake. ‘Dietary intake finding’ (284648005) is the most precise SNOMED CT mapping. No children (such as abnormal intake patterns) or siblings (e.g., nutrient intake finding) are implied by the wording."
76590004,Coenurus cerebralis (organism),Reported as Coenurus cerebralis,"The wording indicates that the entity being reported is Coenurus cerebralis, without adding clinical detail. The singular medical concept is the organism name; SNOMED CT category is Organism, best coded as Coenurus cerebralis (76590004). It does not state infection, detection, body site, or host, so mapping to a disorder or presence finding would introduce unintended semantics. More general or alternative taxa are not supported by the text, so the specific organism concept is the most precise match."
67839001,Merrill Palmer preschool performance (procedure),Merrill Palmer preschool performance conducted,"The wording states that the named procedure was conducted, which denotes performance of the test without adding results, indications, or timing details. It maps to the SNOMED CT category Procedure. SCTID 67839001 specifically identifies the Merrill Palmer preschool performance. Parent categories like general developmental tests are too broad, and sibling instruments (including revised versions) are not indicated. The verb “conducted” is a neutral procedural descriptor and maintains equivalence with the preferred term."
95920001,Homicide by overkill (event),Homicide classified as overkill,"This entry conveys an event classification where the homicide is categorized as overkill. The main concept is an Event; the phrase indicates classification context but does not alter the underlying event concept or introduce mechanism/severity attributes. Parent “Homicide (event)” is too general, and no specific sibling subtype is mentioned. The wording is equivalent to “homicide by overkill,” justifying SCTID 95920001."
429557002,Moderate to high risk of (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value),Follow-up entry: moderate to high risk.,"The phrase indicates that in a follow-up context the risk descriptor is 'moderate to high', with no additional attributes. It is a Qualifier value and maps best to 'Moderate to high risk of (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value)' (429557002). The term 'follow-up entry' is contextual narrative and does not introduce timing attributes within the coded concept; the coded element remains the risk band. Parent qualifiers are too broad, and sibling single-level or alternative-range qualifiers fail to capture the moderate-to-high band."
127503004,"Enterococcus, group IV (organism)",Group IV of Enterococcus,"This paraphrase clearly indicates the Group IV taxonomic grouping within the Enterococcus genus. The main concept is the organism taxon, fitting the Organism hierarchy. It best maps to SCTID 127503004 and does not suggest species-level specificity or clinical findings. Parent 'Enterococcus' would be less specific, and other groups would be incorrect."
249583002,Position of kidney (observable entity),Kidney position noted during exam,"The phrase denotes that the exam included noting the kidney’s position as an observable, without specifying any result, laterality, or abnormality. This is an Observable entity mapped to Position of kidney (249583002). General parents lack organ specificity, and child concepts requiring laterality or an abnormal finding are not indicated. ‘Noted during exam’ is contextual language that doesn’t change the underlying observable."
257678004,Public utility (environment),Public utility environment,"The entry denotes the setting as an environment and names it as “public utility,” mapping directly to Public utility (environment), SCTID 257678004. It remains purely contextual without adding location qualifiers, activity, or hazard, so the environment category is correct. More general environmental codes are too broad, while any named utility subtype would be overly specific and not supported by the text."
737428006,Arthritis clinical management plan (record artifact),Arthritis care plan,"This phrase indicates the existence of a documented care plan pertaining to arthritis. The concept falls into the Record artifact category, aligning directly with SCTID 737428006. It is more specific than a general 'care plan' parent and does not narrow to particular arthritis subtypes, avoiding child concepts. It does not describe the disease itself or a procedure, so sibling disorder or intervention codes are less appropriate. 'Care plan' is an accepted synonym for a clinical management plan and maintains semantic equivalence."
248180000,Lip line (finding),Lip line reported by clinician,"This indicates the clinician reported the lip line as an observed feature, consistent with a documented finding. Main concept: lip line; category: Clinical finding. The most accurate code is Lip line (finding) [248180000], because the entry does not describe an anatomical border or alternative lip-related observations. It does not specify characteristics or states that could lead to child or sibling concepts. The wording is a clear paraphrase of the preferred term in a documentation context."
247731002,Non-verbal auditory hallucinations (finding),Non-speech auditory hallucinations noted on mental status exam,"This clinician documentation specifies hallucinations in the auditory modality and clarifies non-speech content, consistent with non-verbal auditory hallucinations. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 247731002 is the correct code, as it directly encodes non-verbal auditory hallucinations; the parent auditory hallucination concept lacks the non-speech qualifier. The wording excludes verbal content and does not introduce any narrower subtype."
16880931000119102,History of eyelid ptosis (situation),Records indicate a history of eyelid ptosis,"The entry specifies that existing records document a past occurrence of eyelid ptosis, establishing the explicit situational context. This fits the Situation with explicit context category and maps to History of eyelid ptosis (16880931000119102). It is more appropriate than coding the active disorder and does not include extra attributes such as laterality or congenital origin, avoiding child or sibling concepts."
224164009,Financial circumstances (observable entity),Economic circumstances,"The entry expresses the observable characteristic of an individual's economic/financial circumstances without specifying a value. Category: Observable entity. It is best coded to SNOMED CT 224164009 because it targets the financial domain specifically. Broader socioeconomic constructs would add non-financial aspects, and problem-oriented siblings such as financial hardship would add a negative finding not present. 'Economic circumstances' is a safe synonym for financial circumstances."
122682005,Specimen from left kidney obtained by partial nephrectomy (specimen),OR specimen: left kidney—partial nephrectomy,"The entry denotes an operating room (OR) specimen and precisely states left kidney and partial nephrectomy. The main concept is a specimen with the source organ and laterality specified, along with the procurement method. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122682005 is the best match as it represents a specimen from the left kidney obtained via partial nephrectomy. Parent concepts miss the method detail; siblings with right laterality or different methods (biopsy/total nephrectomy) are not appropriate. The OR context does not change the clinical meaning and keeps code selection intact."
1303728006,Entire wall of infrarenal aorta (body structure),Anatomical focus for report: entire wall of infrarenal aorta,"This entry states the report’s anatomical focus is the entire wall of the infrarenal aorta, meaning the full circumferential vessel wall at that segment without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 1303728006 is the precise code. Less specific parents or different-region siblings would not match the phrasing. The context phrase 'for report' does not change the structure being referenced; it remains the exact 'entire wall of infrarenal aorta.'"
223705008,Haiti (geographic location),Haiti documented in the location field,"The location field contains Haiti, which denotes the country as a geographic entity without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). Haiti (geographic location) is the correct code; using a parent or a regional sibling would not match the explicit place stated, and no sublocations within Haiti are referenced."
285063001,Domestic front garden (environment),Domestic front garden,"The entry explicitly names the environment as a domestic front garden. Main concept: domestic front garden. No additional attributes (cause, time, severity, laterality) are present. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This precisely matches SCTID 285063001, which is the environment representing the front garden of a domestic dwelling. Broader parents like “Garden (environment)” or “Front garden (environment)” lack the domestic qualifier, and siblings such as “Domestic back garden (environment)” would be incorrect because this is the front area. The phrase is the preferred term and thus requires no synonym justification."
736358008,Minor ophthalmic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Ophthalmology: minor surgery inpatient care plan,"This documents a care plan within the ophthalmology domain for minor surgery in an inpatient context. The main concept is the care plan artifact, not a procedure or encounter. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and SCTID 736358008 precisely represents 'minor ophthalmic surgery inpatient care plan.' Referencing the specialty (ophthalmology) is context and does not alter the artifact type. Parent concepts that are broader or sibling concepts like outpatient plans are less appropriate."
257672003,Private track (environment),Setting documented as a private track,"The entry notes the setting is a private track, specifying the environmental context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It aligns with SCTID 257672003 by asserting the track’s private status. Parent terms lacking the privacy aspect are less precise, and nothing in the wording indicates a specialized track subtype or public access. The documentation context (“setting documented”) does not add medical attributes, preserving the exact concept."
80359000,Infant diet 7-9 months: meat and egg (finding),Clinic record: infant at nine months—diet includes meat and egg.,A clinic record noting that at nine months the infant’s diet includes meat and egg is a Clinical finding that directly corresponds to SNOMED CT 80359000. The age falls within 7–9 months and the foods are exactly those specified. Parent concepts would be too broad and siblings would differ in content. The dash-separated formatting does not introduce any new attributes or change the code selection.
394821009,Occupational medicine (qualifier value),Occupational medicine—workplace health specialty,"The phrasing identifies occupational medicine as the specialty focused on workplace health, which remains the same specialty concept and maps to 'Occupational medicine (qualifier value)' [394821009]. Category: Qualifier value. No referral, clinic, or department context is introduced. Parent categories like 'Medical specialty' are too broad, and siblings (e.g., 'Public health medicine') address different scopes. The descriptive wording is a safe paraphrase of the specialty without altering the coding target."
73220000,Structure of flat bone (body structure),Anatomic site specified as flat bone structure,"The entry designates the anatomic site and uses the term “flat bone structure,” which corresponds to the SNOMED CT Body structure concept 73220000. No particular bone, laterality, or condition is introduced. It is more precise than parent concepts like “Structure of bone” because it conveys the flat-bone class, and less specific than child concepts such as “Structure of parietal bone.” It does not shift to sibling bone types (e.g., long bone), so this code is the most accurate."
430531002,Tamponade of anterior nasal bleeding using nasal tampon (procedure),Anterior nasal bleeding controlled by tamponade using nasal tampon,"The documented action is tamponade of anterior nasal bleeding using a nasal tampon, which is a Procedure and directly maps to SNOMED CT 430531002. Although the word 'controlled' is descriptive, the core concept remains tamponade with a nasal tampon. This excludes broader management options and different devices (parent/sibling concepts), and specifically rules out posterior bleeding. The use of 'anterior nasal bleeding' and 'nasal tampon' ensures accurate device and location matching without introducing extra attributes."
417905003,Fluoroscopic angiography of testicular artery with contrast (procedure),Testicular arterial fluoroscopic angiography with contrast documented,"The documentation reflects an angiography of the testicular artery performed with fluoroscopic technique and contrast, aligning with the intended procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 417905003 is the correct match as it captures the vessel, fluoroscopy, and contrast. Parent concepts that omit these details and siblings like CT/MR angiography or non-testicular arteries would be inappropriate. The documentation context does not modify the procedure attributes."
104224007,"Anaerobic bacteria, definitive identification, including gas chromatography (procedure)",Gas chromatography–included definitive ID of anaerobic bacteria,"This entry conveys that the identification of anaerobic bacteria is definitive and that gas chromatography is included, directly mapping to SCTID 104224007. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It is more specific than general anaerobic bacterial identification because it mandates definitiveness and GC inclusion. It avoids misclassification into siblings like aerobic bacteria identification or non-GC methods. The shorthand ‘ID’ for identification is a common clinical synonym and does not change the procedure’s nature."
399603006,Specimen from retina obtained by complete exenteration of eye (specimen),Retina specimen obtained by complete exenteration of eye,"The entry explicitly identifies a specimen of retina and states the acquisition method as complete exenteration of the eye. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This aligns precisely with SCTID 399603006, which encodes a retinal specimen obtained via complete exenteration. More generic parents such as 'Retina specimen' lack the specified method, and siblings like 'specimen from retina obtained by enucleation' or 'biopsy' are incorrect because the wording specifies complete exenteration. The phrasing does not introduce laterality, diagnosis, or other attributes, making it a precise match."
214357002,"Motor vehicle traffic accident due to motor vehicle going out of control due to blowout, without collision on the highway, driver of motor vehicle injured (event)",EMS narrative: driver injured; highway scene; tire blowout led to loss of control; no collision occurred.,"The EMS note states a highway motor vehicle traffic accident where a tire blowout led to loss of control, the driver was injured, and no collision occurred. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 214357002 is the exact external cause for this scenario. Parent concepts like generic traffic accidents are less specific, and siblings that include collision, non-traffic locations, or different injured roles would be incorrect. “No collision occurred” is synonymous with “without collision,” preserving the exact attributes."
719964001,Immunoglobulin M antibody to aflatoxin (substance),IgM anti-aflatoxin antibody,"This entry identifies an antibody of the immunoglobulin M class against aflatoxin, which is a substance description. It maps precisely to SCTID 719964001. The wording does not introduce test results or clinical context indicating detection or diagnosis, avoiding Clinical finding or Observable entity concepts. It is more specific than a parent concept like “antibody to aflatoxin” by stating IgM, and it does not imply a child concept that would specify aflatoxin subtype (e.g., B1), maintaining exact specificity."
708131002,"Anti human globulin test technique, direct (qualifier value)",Method: Direct antiglobulin (DAT) technique,"The main concept here is the method, specifically the direct antiglobulin technique, commonly abbreviated as DAT. This clearly indicates the technique qualifier and belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value. The explicit use of “direct” rules out the sibling concept for the indirect AHG technique and avoids the parent nonspecific AHG technique. It does not represent a procedure or result, making 708131002 the most precise match. “DAT” is a clinically accepted synonym for direct antiglobulin and does not alter code selection."
705350006,External prosthesis (physical object),Exoprosthesis,"“Exoprosthesis” is a recognized synonym denoting a prosthesis worn externally. The entry does not introduce details like anatomical site or laterality. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. External prosthesis (physical object) 705350006 is the most exact match, as exoprosthesis and external prosthesis are equivalent terms. Parent prosthesis is too broad, and siblings like endoprosthesis (internal) are incorrect. No child concept is signaled due to lack of site specifics."
722052006,Physical therapy consult note (record artifact),Physical therapy consultation note,"Using “consultation note” instead of “consult note” is a standard linguistic variant without changing meaning; it still denotes the document type of a physical therapy consultation. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and code 722052006 best captures this exact document subtype. Alternatives like “physical therapy evaluation note” or “referral note” would introduce different document purposes or workflows, so they are less appropriate."
720108005,Antibody to Hepatitis C virus C2 (substance),Antibody to HCV C2,"The entry states an antibody to HCV C2, which directly expresses the antibody substance aimed at the Hepatitis C virus C2 antigen. No immunoglobulin subclass, titer, or test result is included. This is a Substance concept, best represented by Antibody to Hepatitis C virus C2 (substance), SCTID 720108005. A broader parent omits the C2 specification, and siblings targeting other HCV antigens are not applicable. The phrasing is a concise synonym that preserves the exact antigenic specificity."
224056000,Oahu (geographic location),Oahu Island,"The phrase explicitly identifies the entity as the island named Oahu. The main concept is the island as a place. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 224056000 is correct because it encodes Oahu specifically. A parent like “Hawaiian Islands” is too broad, and siblings (e.g., “Kauai,” “Maui”) are different islands. The wording adds no extra attributes beyond naming the location."
701254008,Bidirectional-anesthesia breathing circuit (physical object),Anesthesia machine equipped with a bidirectional breathing circuit,"The statement identifies the attached physical object: a bidirectional anesthesia breathing circuit. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Although it notes the circuit is equipped on the machine, the object itself is a bidirectional anesthesia breathing circuit, aligning with SCTID 701254008. Using 'bidirectional' prevents mapping to the parent 'anesthesia breathing circuit' and does not imply other specific subtypes, thus excluding siblings such as unidirectional circuits."
411613005,Turkey feathers diagnostic allergen extract (product),Order placed for turkey feathers diagnostic allergen extract,"This documentation line identifies the specific product ordered: turkey feathers diagnostic allergen extract, mapping to SNOMED CT 411613005 (Product). While the phrase mentions an order action, the coded concept remains the product itself; no procedural details or therapeutic intent are added. Broader parent concepts would omit the turkey feather source, and sibling concepts (e.g., chicken feather extracts or therapeutic extracts) would not be accurate. The wording is a context variant that still represents the same product."
468835006,Electrolytic sterilizer (physical object),Electrolytic sterilizer unit,"The term specifies a sterilizer unit operating via an electrolytic mechanism, indicating a single physical object device. Category: Physical object. SCTID 468835006 applies because it denotes the electrolytic sterilizer subtype precisely. Using a parent concept like 'Sterilizer unit' would omit the electrolytic modality, and sibling device types are not implied. The addition of 'unit' describes the device form factor without changing the concept, remaining clinically equivalent."
768457003,Product containing bismuth and/or bismuth compound (product),Bismuth-based medication,"This phrase describes a medicine whose active component is bismuth or a bismuth compound, which is a Pharmaceutical/biologic product in SNOMED CT. No dose form, brand, or specific compound is named, so Product containing bismuth and/or bismuth compound (768457003) is the exact fit. It avoids mapping to child concepts like bismuth subsalicylate and does not drift to the substance hierarchy (e.g., Bismuth (substance)). The synonym “medication” is a standard clinical expression for a product and does not alter the code selection."
122719002,Specimen from fallopian tube obtained by hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy (specimen),Uterine tube sample from hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy,"This phrase identifies a sample from the uterine tube (synonym for fallopian tube) and links it to procurement via hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy. The main concept is a specimen, and the explicit attributes are anatomical source and obtaining procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122719002 is the exact concept because it specifies both the site (fallopian/uterine tube) and the combined surgery. A parent “fallopian tube specimen” would lose the method detail, and a sibling tied to other procedures or sites would not match. “Sample” is a common synonym for specimen and does not change coding."
765492005,Non-drug prescription record (record artifact),Non-pharmaceutical prescription record,"This phrase states there is a prescription record and clarifies it is non-pharmaceutical, aligning with a record artifact focused on non-drug items. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps most precisely to Non-drug prescription record (SCTID 765492005) because 'non-pharmaceutical' is a clinically equivalent synonym for non-drug. Using the broader parent Prescription record would ignore the explicit exclusion of medication, and selecting the sibling Medication prescription record would contradict the wording. No more specific child (e.g., device-specific) is indicated, so the general non-drug record artifact is the correct code."
431063007,Nocardia pneumoniae (organism),Taxonomic entity: Nocardia pneumoniae,"The wording emphasizes the taxonomic nature of the reference and provides the precise species name, without clinical attributes like presence or infection. The main concept is an Organism, and SNOMED CT code 431063007 Nocardia pneumoniae (organism) fits exactly. A parent organism concept would be less specific, and any child/strain concepts are not mentioned. The term “taxonomic entity” is a contextual descriptor, not a different concept, so it does not shift coding to a finding or disease."
719325005,Smallpox vaccination contraindicated (situation),Preventive care plan: smallpox vaccine contraindicated,"The preventive care plan records that the smallpox vaccine is contraindicated, aligning with 'Smallpox vaccination contraindicated' (SCTID 719325005). The main concept is the contraindication for smallpox vaccination; there are no extra attributes such as cause or timing. The SNOMED category is Situation with explicit context. Using a general parent concept would be too broad, and selecting any child concept would require a specified cause, which is absent. 'Vaccine contraindicated' here is semantically equivalent to 'vaccination contraindicated.'"
409968004,Preventive medicine (qualifier value),Area of practice: preventive medicine,"This entry frames 'preventive medicine' as an 'area of practice,' which is a synonymic way of denoting a medical specialty qualifier. The main concept is the specialty; no procedural action or clinical finding is described. It fits the Qualifier value category, and 409968004 precisely represents 'Preventive medicine' as a specialty. The parent 'Clinical specialty' would be too general, and no specific subspecialty or sibling specialty is named. Terms relating to preventive services or prophylactic interventions are not present, so it does not map to procedures or intents."
441484007,History of craniopharyngioma (situation),Patient reports history of craniopharyngioma,"The patient’s report indicates a past diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, clearly reflecting historical context rather than active disease. The main concept is personal history of this tumor, under Situation with explicit context. Code 441484007 is the most specific mapping. A sibling concept like family history is excluded by the explicit personal report, and the disorder concept would imply current presence. The phrase is an equivalent expression of 'history of craniopharyngioma' without altering attributes."
1237570003,Maternal history of viral hepatitis B (situation),Prenatal record notes maternal history of HBV,"This documentation entry specifies that the prenatal record contains a maternal history of HBV (hepatitis B virus), maintaining the context of maternal and historical. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. It maps to SCTID 1237570003 because it denotes historical information about the mother’s HBV, not the patient’s personal history or current maternal infection. 'HBV' is a clinically equivalent synonym for hepatitis B. Sibling concepts like 'Family history of HBV' are less precise, and adding timing such as 'during pregnancy' would constitute a different child concept."
105442005,Death of companion (event),Patient states companion died,"A patient-reported phrasing that conveys the event of a companion’s death, without adding time, cause, or associated emotional reactions. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The term 'companion' keeps this aligned with Death of companion (event) rather than a parent death concept or siblings like Death of spouse/partner/friend. 'Died' is an accepted synonym for 'death,' so the appropriate code is 105442005."
71420008,Central venous pressure (observable entity),Central venous pressure noted in documentation,"This entry reflects that the central venous pressure parameter is mentioned, not measured or interpreted. It aligns with the Observable entity SCTID 71420008. The phrasing avoids more general pressures and does not imply distinct observables like right atrial or jugular venous pressures. It also avoids findings such as abnormal/normal and procedures such as monitoring or measurement. Therefore, the pure observable entity code is the most precise match."
167869007,Elbow joint synovial fluid (specimen),"Synovial fluid, elbow joint — specimen received","This describes a received specimen of synovial fluid from the elbow joint, aligning directly with 'Elbow joint synovial fluid (specimen)'. The category is Specimen. 'Received' is process context and does not change the specimen identity. The entry is more precise than the generic synovial fluid specimen and does not imply child attributes like laterality or additional findings."
26720006,Blood group antibody McC^c^ (substance),History note—McC^c^ blood group antibody,"In a history note, the term identifies the McC^c^ blood group antibody, focusing on the antibody substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, aligning with SCTID 26720006. The context 'history note' does not add attributes like presence, titer, or timing for coding; the core content is the named antibody. Broader parent antibody concepts lack the specified McC^c^ target, and antigen or detection findings would be misclassifications. The wording is a clinically equivalent label for the same substance."
303637009,Audiological device (physical object),Audiological device—unspecified type,"The entry explicitly identifies the device as audiological and clarifies that no specific type is provided, which keeps it at the generic device level. It maps to SNOMED CT 303637009 (Physical object). Mentioning 'unspecified type' avoids any implication of child devices such as hearing aids or implants. Parent device categories are less specific than the audiology domain, making the given concept the optimal match. The wording adds clarity without introducing prohibited attributes like laterality or function."
1193625000,Island in region of American Samoa (geographic location),Referral origin: island within American Samoa,"The origin context highlights the location as an island inside the American Samoa region. Main concept: geographic location (island). SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. By specifying 'island' and 'American Samoa', it is more specific than the generic island parent and distinct from the broader region concept. No specific island is named, so child concepts are not indicated. SCTID 1193625000 is the precise match."
771677008,Product containing calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist (product),Medication list: CGRP receptor antagonist,"The context indicates that the medication list includes a product from the CGRP receptor antagonist class, emphasizing the product rather than a substance. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). SCTID 771677008 is the best match because it captures the class of products without specifying a particular agent, dose, or route. Substance-only concepts or procedure-related administration codes would be less appropriate. The phrasing maintains equivalence to the product concept and does not introduce additional attributes."
223588005,Cambodia (geographic location),Kingdom of Cambodia,"“Kingdom of Cambodia” is the official country name and a clinically acceptable synonym for the same geographic entity. The main concept remains the national geographic location; no additional attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). This precisely maps to Cambodia (geographic location), SCTID 223588005, because it refers to the same sovereign country. Parent concepts like Geographic location are too broad, while child concepts such as specific provinces are not indicated. The synonym does not change the code selection since it denotes the identical country entity."
178845007,Reconstruction of thumb from existing index finger (procedure),Index-to-thumb pollicization procedure,"The phrase indicates pollicization in which the index finger is transformed to serve as the thumb, i.e., thumb reconstruction from the index finger. This is a Procedure. It aligns precisely with SCTID 178845007 by naming both the donor (index) and recipient role (thumb). Broader procedures or different donor digits are excluded, preventing misclassification to parent or sibling concepts. The wording is a safe synonym and does not introduce attributes like laterality or etiology."
223825004,Cephalonia (geographic location),Travel diary entry: Kefalonia,"Although framed as a travel diary entry, the substantive concept given is the place name “Kefalonia,” a synonym for Cephalonia. No additional attributes like dates, country, or region are present. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location within the Location hierarchy, appropriately coded as SCTID 223825004. Parent concepts (e.g., Greece) would be too general, while child/sibling options (Ionian Islands, specific towns) do not match the wording. The synonym maintains equivalence and does not alter the coding target."
185487007,Podiatry outreach clinic (environment),Podiatry outreach clinic facility,"This entry identifies the facility environment as a podiatry outreach clinic, fitting SNOMED CT’s Environment category and mapping to 185487007. The term “facility” does not change the semantic scope; it still denotes the clinic environment without introducing other attributes (e.g., location details or timeframe). Parent concepts lacking either the outreach qualifier or the podiatry specialty are less precise, and sibling concepts (e.g., generic outreach facilities or other specialty outreach clinics) do not match the stated specialty."
708253009,Family Sordariaceae (organism),Patient mentions the term ‘Sordariaceae’,"A patient-reported mention of “Sordariaceae” names the organism family without implying disease or test attributes, aligning with Family Sordariaceae (organism), SCTID 708253009 in the Organism category. Choosing a broader parent taxon would lose family specificity, and a child genus/species would over-specify beyond the statement. The phrasing remains uniquely codable to the family concept."
768624005,Product containing thiazole (product),Product with thiazole as an ingredient,"This phrasing states that thiazole is an ingredient within a product, clearly pointing to a medicinal/pharmaceutical product concept. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). Product containing thiazole (768624005) precisely fits as it represents any product containing thiazole without specificity for dose or form. Substance-only concepts would not reflect the product context, and no extra attributes warrant a child concept like a tablet or solution form."
708204009,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Brucella (substance),Brucella DNA — the pathogen’s DNA,"The entry references the DNA of Brucella (a pathogen), which remains deoxyribonucleic acid of Brucella; SNOMED CT category: Substance. No testing, detection, or clinical status is implied. The correct code is Deoxyribonucleic acid of Brucella (708204009). Using parent DNA or organism/infection codes would be inaccurate. The explanatory apposition reiterates the same substance without introducing new attributes."
1011000181107,Comamonas jiangduensis (organism),Report entry — Comamonas jiangduensis,"The text reflects a report line item naming Comamonas jiangduensis. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Despite the report context, the core concept is the species itself, which maps to SCTID 1011000181107. No method, presence, or clinical condition is asserted, so a finding or procedure concept would be less appropriate. Parent genus or sibling species do not match the exact species designation provided."
420652005,Until gone - dosing instruction fragment (qualifier value),Pharmacy counseling: continue until gone,"The counseling note uses the dosing fragment “continue until gone,” conveying the supply-completion endpoint. This is the Qualifier value concept represented by SCTID 420652005. No added attributes or conditions are introduced. Parent concepts would be generic, while siblings that specify time durations or symptom-based stopping points would mischaracterize this instruction."
1365798006,Photographic extraoral image of face with teeth positioned to indicate occlusal cant (record artifact),Facial photograph (extraoral) with teeth arranged to indicate occlusal cant,"This entry describes the same artifact using the synonym 'facial photograph' and clarifies extraoral acquisition, noting teeth arranged to indicate occlusal cant, matching SCTID 1365798006. The main concept is a photographic record artifact; attributes are extraoral facial imaging and explicit indication of occlusal cant via tooth positioning. It is more specific than parent concepts of facial photographs and must not be confused with sibling artifacts (intraoral photos or x-rays). The wording does not introduce a new clinical finding; it only describes the content design of the photograph, making the record artifact concept the precise match."
4138004,Hebeloma (organism),Cataloged as Hebeloma,"This phrasing indicates an organism catalog entry naming Hebeloma, which is the genus-level organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and Hebeloma (organism) SCTID 4138004 is the precise match because only the genus is specified with no species or clinical attributes. Parent concepts such as Fungal organism are broader than needed, and child species would add specificity absent from the text. The cataloging context is a synonymic variation that does not affect code selection."
225767001,Every thirty minutes (qualifier value),q½h,"The notation 'q½h' means 'every half hour,' i.e., every 30 minutes. The concept is a temporal frequency qualifier under the Qualifier value hierarchy. SNOMED CT code 225767001 precisely corresponds. Other interval qualifiers (quarter-hourly, hourly) are siblings and not applicable. The fractional shorthand is semantically equivalent and keeps the same frequency."
260575009,Septal-splitting approach (qualifier value),Split-septal approach,"This synonym reorders the words but conveys an identical method: an approach via a split of the septum. Category: Qualifier value. It aligns exactly with Septal-splitting approach (260575009). Parent concepts are overly broad, and siblings that imply puncture, fenestration, or traversal are not stated. The wording holds strictly to the approach and adds no anatomical specificity or timing, preserving the correct qualifier."
272955001,KI10 (body structure),"Acupoint Yingu, KI10","This entry pairs the traditional name Yingu with KI10, unambiguously denoting the Kidney-10 acupoint. It represents a Body structure. The most specific SNOMED concept is KI10 (SCTID 272955001); parents (generic acupoints or Kidney meridian) are less specific, and siblings (other KI points) are different locations. The synonym does not alter attributes or imply procedures."
469915001,Isolation room trolley (physical object),Isolation-room trolley,"Hyphenation does not change the semantics; the concept remains the trolley for isolation rooms, which maps directly to Isolation room trolley (physical object), SCTID 469915001. Category: Physical object. The wording excludes broader or different-use trolleys and does not add attributes such as purpose beyond the isolation room designation. Parent concepts (generic trolley) would be less precise, and functional sibling concepts (e.g., procedure trolley) are not supported by the text."
362132003,Entire gastric muscularis (body structure),Anatomical layer: gastric muscularis,"This entry identifies the anatomical layer as the gastric muscularis and adds only contextual labeling (“anatomical layer”), not altering the underlying structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It precisely aligns with ""Entire gastric muscularis"" because it specifies the muscle layer of the stomach without suggesting any sublayer or abnormality. Parent structures like stomach wall would include multiple layers, and child/sibling sublayers are not specified by this wording. Therefore, the entire gastric muscularis concept is the most accurate match."
217927009,Accident caused by falling object due to action of machinery (event),"Patient-reported: ""The machine made the item drop; that was the accident.""","The patient report clearly links a falling item (falling object) to the machine’s action, identifying the accident mechanism. This is an Event and matches SCTID 217927009. The phrasing uses lay language but remains semantically equivalent to 'due to action of machinery.' Broader falling-object accidents without machinery, or different machinery-related accident concepts, would not reflect the stated cause."
308713002,Ethyl chloride dental pulp vitality test (procedure),Pulp vitality testing via ethyl chloride cold spray,"This text describes conducting pulp vitality testing using ethyl chloride cold spray as the stimulus. The main concept is a dental pulp diagnostic procedure. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The method specification (ethyl chloride cold spray) aligns directly with SCTID 308713002 and is more precise than the unspecified parent test. It excludes other cold media and electric methods, maintaining the correct mapping without adding timing or result attributes."
41399007,Product containing oxazolidinedione (product),Oxazolidinedione-containing product,"This paraphrase identifies a product that contains oxazolidinedione, without adding attributes such as strength, route, or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The entry is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and maps cleanly to 41399007. More general parent product concepts lack the specified ingredient, while child/sibling concepts (e.g., formulation-specific or branded variants) would require details not present in the entry. It avoids mapping to the oxazolidinedione substance concept by explicitly stating the product context."
714727002,Femur tibia shaft prosthesis (physical object),Orthopedic prosthesis for femur and tibia shafts,"This describes an orthopedic device specifically for the shafts of both femur and tibia, which is a Physical object corresponding to Femur tibia shaft prosthesis (714727002). The specification of both bones and the shaft segment makes it more precise than an undifferentiated bone prosthesis parent concept and distinct from single-bone or joint-focused siblings. The phrasing adds no extra attributes such as laterality or clinical status, maintaining clear alignment with the target concept."
409700000,Animal to human transmission (qualifier value),Transmission type: animal-to-human,"The entry categorizes the transmission ‘type’ and specifies animal-to-human direction, keeping the focus on the qualifier value. The main concept is a transmission qualifier consistent with SNOMED CT code 409700000. A general transmission type parent would be insufficiently specific, and alternative siblings (human-to-human, environment-to-human) would be inaccurate. The phrase avoids introducing certainty or disorder semantics and remains a pure qualifier."
721599005,Wound care management note (record artifact),Wound care management clinical note,"This phrase identifies a clinical note whose topic is wound care management, which precisely corresponds to Wound care management note (record artifact), SCTID 721599005. The explicit note type (clinical note) and subject (wound care management) indicate a record artifact. Category: Record artifact. It is more specific than a generic Clinical note and does not imply narrower siblings like Progress note, Discharge note, or Wound assessment note. The addition of “clinical” describes the documentation context without changing the concept; it does not introduce author role, timing, or wound subtype, keeping the mapping to 721599005 exact."
214530003,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving explosion of any part of motor vehicle while in motion, passenger on motor cycle injured (event)",Cause of injury: explosion of motor vehicle while in motion in a noncollision traffic accident—motorcycle passenger,"This entry clearly sets the external cause as an explosion of a motor vehicle while in motion, occurring in a noncollision traffic accident, with the injured person being a motorcycle passenger. It matches SNOMED CT 214530003 (Event). Parent categories lack the necessary detail, and sibling concepts involving different occupant roles or collision mechanisms are inappropriate. The phrasing is a direct restatement and introduces no additional qualifiers."
410605003,Confirmed present (qualifier value),Confirmed as present.,"The entry specifies that presence has been confirmed, with no mention of cause, severity, timing, or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the precise code is 410605003 Confirmed present. Using Present alone would fail to capture confirmation, and using Suspected present or Possible would misstate the certainty. The phrase is a standard clinical paraphrase of confirmed presence and does not change the code selection."
423204009,Orthopedic assessment (procedure),Orthopedics assessment documented,"This entry indicates that an assessment by the orthopedics specialty is documented, maintaining focus on the procedure itself without adding attributes such as timing or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Orthopedic assessment (procedure) [SCTID: 423204009] precisely captures an orthopedic specialty assessment. Broader parents like general assessment are too nonspecific, and siblings such as consultation or referral do not match the wording. The documentation context does not alter the underlying procedure concept."
350273004,Product containing quaternary quinolinium and surfactant (product),Product name descriptor: quaternary quinolinium plus surfactant,"A name descriptor that enumerates quaternary quinolinium plus surfactant directly specifies the product’s constituent substances, mapping to SNOMED CT SCTID 350273004 in the Pharmaceutical/biologic product domain. The entry includes no extra attributes such as dose, route, or brand. Parent concepts lacking one substance or generic product classes would be less precise, and siblings/children with different or additional substances or with specified forms would be mismatched. The phrasing remains a pure composition statement suitable for the exact concept."
218107005,Accident caused by explosive gases (event),Accident due to explosive gases,"This phrasing conveys the same concept: an accident whose cause is explosive gases. The attributes are limited to accidental nature and causal agent, aligning with the original concept. In SNOMED CT, this is an Event, and SCTID 218107005 precisely captures an accident caused by explosive gases. Using “due to” is a clinically standard synonym for “caused by” and does not alter the code selection. A broader parent like “Accidental event” lacks the specified cause, while siblings such as “Accident caused by electricity” or “Exposure to gas” do not match the stated explosive gas cause or accident framing, making 218107005 the correct choice."
871552002,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody (observable entity),Detection of anti-COVID-19 antibodies,"The phrase targets detection of antibodies to the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and does not include results, isotype, or methodology. Category: Observable entity. The correct code is 871552002, which models the observable entity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. A procedure code would imply performance of a test, and a finding code would imply an outcome; neither is present. Children specifying IgG/IgM or neutralizing antibodies are too specific for this general detection wording."
9985006,Desarginisated complement enzyme (substance),Desarginated complement enzyme,"“Desarginated” is a spelling variant synonymous with “desarginisated” and indicates the removal of terminal arginine, maintaining the same substance meaning. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. No additional qualifiers, measurements, or component identities are given, so the precise concept remains SCTID 9985006. Broader parent concepts would not capture the des-Arg state, and any more specific child concepts indicating a particular complement factor are not implied."
1303272008,Structure of digital vessel of hand (body structure),Diagram annotation: finger vessel (hand),"This indicates a diagram annotation for a hand finger vessel, which is the same anatomical concept as a digital vessel of the hand. Category: Body structure. The context 'diagram annotation' does not add clinical attributes; thus SCTID 1303272008 is appropriate. It avoids specifying vessel subtype or detailed site, preventing mapping to child concepts, and retains digital specificity beyond broader hand vessel parents."
463909007,"Orthopedic cement mixer, manual (physical object)",Manual mixer for orthopedic bone cement,"Main concept: manual mixer for orthopedic bone cement; explicit attribute: manual (nonpowered). SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The phrasing identifies the mixer and its intended orthopedic cement use and the manual method of operation, making it an exact fit for “Orthopedic cement mixer, manual.” Parent terms without manual operation are less precise, and siblings including powered devices or vacuum systems are not suggested here."
309055005,Breast fluid specimen (specimen),Follow-up notes reference a breast fluid specimen,"Follow-up context is administrative, while the referenced entity is a breast fluid specimen, aligning with the Specimen category concept Breast fluid specimen. No collection method, subtype, laterality, or pathology attributes are added. It is more specific than the parent Breast specimen and avoids children such as breast milk or nipple aspirate fluid specimens. It does not suggest tissue/swab siblings. Therefore, Breast fluid specimen is the most precise choice."
224839009,Grocer's shop (environment),Grocery store environment,"The phrase explicitly denotes the environment type, a grocery store setting. Main concept: grocery store environment. No cause, time, or other attributes are added. SNOMED CT category: Environment. Because it specifies the environment as a grocery store, it matches SCTID 224839009. Parents like “shop environment” lack the grocery specificity, while siblings such as “supermarket environment” are different entities. This entry is a precise paraphrase that retains the intended concept without scope change."
411431003,Yarrow allergen patch test product (product),Yarrow allergen patch test product administered,"Despite the action verb, the subject remains the product—the yarrow allergen preparation for patch testing. The SNOMED CT category is Product. No outcome or dosing attributes are added; it simply denotes use of the product. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings for other allergens or for prick testing would not fit the explicit patch test context."
371538006,Advance directive report (record artifact),Advance directive report forwarded from facility,"This indicates the report was forwarded, clarifying that the artifact is an advance directive report, a Record artifact. The forwarding is a workflow detail only. The most precise code is “Advance directive report (record artifact).” It neither conveys specific directive content nor a status finding, so mapping to sibling concepts like DNR order or to broader parent document classes would be less accurate."
256404001,Plasma - cryoprecipitate depleted (product),Plasma – cryoprecipitate depleted (product),"This entry restates the preferred term and explicitly notes the product nature, ensuring the focus is on the blood product rather than an action or diagnosis. The main concept is a blood Product where cryoprecipitate has been removed, exactly mapping to SCTID 256404001. Broader plasma concepts are less precise, and sibling products like fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate itself are not appropriate. No extra attributes are added."
17034005,Wad Medani virus (organism),Wad Medani orthobunyavirus,"This text uses the accepted taxonomic genus descriptor 'orthobunyavirus' alongside the specific name 'Wad Medani,' referring to the same organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It still targets SCTID 17034005 rather than the parent Orthobunyavirus (organism) because the specific virus is named; no findings or clinical states are implied. The synonym is clinically equivalent, providing taxonomy context without changing the coded concept."
1352891003,Union for International Cancer Control stage IIID (qualifier value),UICC stage group IIID,"The wording specifies 'stage group' with the UICC system and the subgroup IIID, which is a staging qualifier. This is a Qualifier value and corresponds to SCTID 1352891003. It does not state any cancer type, TNM components, clinical vs pathologic designation, or timing, so it remains a pure qualifier. Using 'stage group' is a clinically equivalent synonym for the UICC stage subgroup, not implying a different concept."
242545004,Exposure to heat flash (event),Environmental exposure noted: heat flash,"This phrasing labels the exposure specifically as environmental and identifies the hazard as a heat flash, without introducing injury, time, or severity. The concept type is Event. SCTID 242545004 is exact because it captures heat flash exposure specifically, whereas parent concepts that reference general heat exposure would be less specific. No sibling hazards (e.g., flame, smoke) or injury outcomes are mentioned, keeping the selection focused on the event exposure."
426007002,Multiple dose characteristic (observable entity),Multiple-dose classification,"The wording frames the characteristic as a classification, which is still an observable attribute indicating a multiple-dose nature. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 426007002 is appropriate because it identifies the multiple-dose characteristic; it does not suggest regimen, container specifics, or counts that would map elsewhere. Parent dose characteristic would be less specific."
735321000,Surgical inpatient care plan (record artifact),Chart contains a surgical inpatient care plan,"This indicates that the patient's chart includes the care plan for surgical care in the inpatient setting, focusing on the document artifact. Category: Record artifact. Surgical inpatient care plan (record artifact) 735321000 is the most accurate code. Parent concepts are overly broad, while siblings like inpatient care plan without surgical specificity or surgical care plan without setting would be incomplete. The entry adds no timing, severity, or other attributes."
773446009,Rehabilitation psychiatry care plan (record artifact),Problem list item: rehabilitation psychiatry care plan,"This entry indicates the artifact appears as a problem-list item, while the named concept is the rehabilitation psychiatry care plan itself. SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The surrounding context is neutral and preserves the artifact’s identity, justifying SCTID 773446009. Parent or sibling care plan concepts lacking the dual specialty focus would be less precise. No extra qualifiers are present."
31441000087106,Erostrotheca multiformis (organism),Cataloged as Erostrotheca multiformis,"Describing the entity as cataloged under 'Erostrotheca multiformis' indicates the species-level taxon, mapping to the Organism concept SCTID 31441000087106. The statement does not add attributes like pathogenic role, infection, or anatomical site. Parent genus or sibling species concepts would be less precise or incorrect, and no child strain details are provided. The wording remains a direct reference to the same species."
272083002,Non-International System of Units unit of concentration part 1 (qualifier value),Use non-SI concentration unit — part 1,"The entry instructs the selection of a unit from the non-SI concentration set, specifically part 1, which aligns with SCTID 272083002. The concept is a unit classification (Qualifier value), with attributes limited to non-SI, concentration, and the part 1 grouping. A more general parent like 'Unit of concentration' does not capture the non-SI or part designation, and a child concept would name a particular unit, which is absent here. Sibling concepts such as SI concentration units or the part 2 subset are incompatible with the explicit 'non-SI' and 'part 1' phrasing."
411834000,Trichophyton mentagrophytes variant goetzii diagnostic allergen extract (product),Fungal diagnostic allergen extract: Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. goetzii,"The entry indicates a fungal diagnostic allergen extract and then specifies the fungus and variant, T. mentagrophytes var. goetzii. The concept is a Product in SNOMED CT. SCTID 411834000 is the most precise match because it encodes the diagnostic allergen extract for this specific variant. A broader fungal allergen extract parent would be underspecified; different variant or therapeutic extracts are inappropriate. The phrasing clarifies taxonomy but does not introduce new attributes beyond diagnostic use and source."
289471003,Small labia minora (finding),Physical exam: small labia minora observed,"This exam documentation notes the observation of small labia minora, which corresponds to Small labia minora (finding), SCTID 289471003. The category is Clinical finding; the entry does not introduce additional attributes (timing, cause, laterality, severity). Parent concepts would be less specific, and sibling concepts ('large labia minora', 'atrophic labia minora') do not match. 'Observed' simply indicates documentation and does not change the concept."
223876001,Durham (geographic location),Facility: Durham,"The facility context anchors the single codable concept 'Durham' as a place. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and Durham (geographic location) SCTID: 223876001 is the most precise match. The wording does not specify a particular jurisdictional type or nation, therefore a more specific child is not appropriate, and the generic parent would be less precise than this named location."
413920005,Corneal shape (observable entity),Form of the cornea,"This wording conveys the attribute of shape specific to the cornea, with no mention of normality, laterality, severity, timing, or methods. It is best represented by Corneal shape (observable entity) 413920005. Using a broader parent like Shape (observable entity) omits the anatomical specificity, and choosing related observables such as curvature or topography would misclassify the property. 'Form' is a clinically equivalent synonym for shape in this context."
710004005,Retruded to maximum intercuspation (observable entity),Jaw relation item: retruded to MIP,"Labels a jaw relation observable from retruded to maximum intercuspation (MIP), without quantification or clinical judgment. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The concept 710004005 specifically captures this occlusal relation. Parent/sibling concepts that address jaw relations broadly or single positions are less precise, and child concepts indicating measurement or pathology are not supported here."
105166005,Diphenhydramine measurement (procedure),Assay for diphenhydramine level,"This describes an assay performed to determine the level of diphenhydramine, i.e., measurement. In SNOMED CT, it is a Procedure and matches 105166005. The entry avoids adding attributes such as specimen, timing, or result, so it doesn’t point to child specimen-specific procedures or sibling screening tests. 'Assay' is a clinically equivalent term for measurement and does not change the intended code."
231247007,Local anesthetic intravenous regional block of arm (procedure),Bier block of the arm,"‘Bier block’ is a well-established synonym for intravenous regional anesthesia using local anesthetic; specifying 'of the arm' pinpoints the site. The category is Procedure. SCTID 231247007 precisely matches a local anesthetic intravenous regional block of the arm. Using a parent like 'Bier block' without site is underspecified, and siblings (e.g., Bier block of leg) are excluded by the arm reference. The synonym does not introduce new attributes; it is clinically equivalent nomenclature for the same procedure."
218072001,Accident caused by explosion of air tank (event),Air cylinder explosion accident,"“Air cylinder” is commonly used interchangeably with “air tank” when referring to compressed air vessels. Coupled with “accident,” this maps to accident caused by explosion of air tank. Category: Event. Using “air cylinder” does not broaden to other gases and does not introduce new attributes, so parent or sibling concepts like general cylinder explosions or non-accident explosions are less accurate. The synonym preserves equivalence without altering the intent."
47235009,Contact with power tool (event),Contact with motorized tool,"The term 'motorized tool' is a clinically safe paraphrase for 'power tool' and does not introduce new attributes, maintaining the concept of contact with a powered tool. The category is Event. The correct SNOMED CT code is 47235009. Parents (machinery contact) are too general, and children specifying a tool subtype are not justified by the wording. The synonym does not change the code selection."
134385008,Referral to dietician declined (situation),Referral to a dietician was declined.,"This sentence clearly expresses that the referral to a dietician was declined. It is a Situation and aligns with SNOMED CT 134385008. Parent concepts such as “Referral declined” don’t specify the professional target, and sibling concepts such as “Referral to dietician requested” or “made” represent different referral states. The wording remains within the scope of refusal without introducing added attributes."
765428001,Product containing rhenium radioisotope (product),Clinical note: radiopharmaceutical product with rhenium radioisotope,"This clinical documentation references a radiopharmaceutical product containing rhenium radioisotope, which maps to Product containing rhenium radioisotope (product), SCTID 765428001. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. 'Radiopharmaceutical product' is a valid synonym indicating a radioisotope-containing medicinal product. The lack of isotope number, compound, dose, route, or intended use prevents misclassification to child or procedural concepts."
364972005,Finding related to ability to perform hand functions (finding),Clinic documentation: finding tied to ability to perform hand functions,"This phrase describes a clinical finding in clinic documentation related to the ability to perform hand functions, with no status (normal/abnormal), laterality, severity, timing, or cause stated. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 364972005 is the most precise match, as it encodes findings about hand function ability. Parent-level functional findings are too general, and child-level terms specifying impairment or intact function are not supported by the neutral wording. Sibling findings that focus on strength or dexterity are narrower constructs and not indicated."
1255768001,Presence of ALK tyrosine kinase receptor in primary malignant neoplasm of lung by immunohistochemistry (observable entity),IHC for ALK tyrosine kinase receptor presence in primary lung carcinoma,"This entry captures an immunohistochemical evaluation of the presence of ALK tyrosine kinase receptor in a primary lung carcinoma, directly matching the Observable entity. It does not add a result or other attributes. Parent or sibling concepts such as generic ALK presence by IHC without lung primary context or ALK gene rearrangement by FISH are not as precise. 'Primary lung carcinoma' and 'IHC' are standard synonyms that maintain semantic equivalence."
217989009,Accident caused by water driven turbine (event),Mechanism: accident caused by water-driven turbine,Stating the mechanism clarifies the causal agent as a water-driven turbine for an accident event. This corresponds to the Event concept SCTID 217989009. The entry does not include injury details or context that would shift coding. Generic machinery accident concepts or other turbine types would be less specific; the chosen code is therefore the best fit.
1352559008,Union for International Cancer Control pT1 (qualifier value),Pathology: UICC TNM pT1,"This entry frames the context as a pathology result and explicitly states UICC TNM pT1. The main concept is UICC pathologic T1. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The wording aligns directly with the qualifier value for UICC pT1 without any added attributes like substage or organ site. Parent or generic T-category concepts would be less specific, and child variants such as pT1a/pT1b are not indicated. Sibling concepts like AJCC pT1 or UICC cT1 are excluded by both 'UICC' and 'pT' language."
124733001,Delayed male climacteric (finding),Delayed onset of andropause documented,"The documentation states that the onset of andropause is delayed, which is equivalent to delayed male climacteric as a Clinical finding. The most precise code is Delayed male climacteric (finding). Coding to male climacteric without delay would omit the key attribute, and coding to hypogonadism disorders would add etiology beyond the documented finding."
1365809003,Photographic intraoral direct image of left buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Dental imaging: photographic intraoral direct image of the left buccal segment with teeth in CO.,"This describes a dental imaging artifact consisting of a photographic intraoral direct image of the left buccal segment taken with teeth in centric occlusion. The concept is a Record artifact and corresponds exactly to SCTID 1365809003. A general parent 'intraoral photographic image' would omit laterality and occlusal positioning, and siblings (e.g., right buccal, anterior segment, indirect mirror images) are excluded by 'left,' 'buccal segment,' and 'direct.' The abbreviation 'CO' is a standard synonym for centric occlusion in dentistry and does not alter the semantics."
700685000,Rigid penile prosthesis (physical object),Rigid penile implant device,"This refers to a device implanted in the penis characterized as rigid, which is a physical object. “Implant” is a typical synonym for prosthesis in device naming. The correct mapping is Rigid penile prosthesis (physical object), SCTID 700685000. General penile prosthesis is too broad, and inflatable/malleable siblings are excluded by the rigid attribute."
368135005,Entire skin of antecubital fossa (body structure),Site of interest: whole skin in antecubital fossa,"The phrase identifies the anatomical site and uses 'whole' to indicate the entire skin within the antecubital fossa. Category: Body structure. It is the precise match because it selects skin tissue and the specific fossa region, with no added clinical attributes. A parent such as 'skin of antecubital area' without explicit fossa or siblings like 'dermis of antecubital fossa' would be less appropriate."
277972004,Full movement (qualifier value),Full movement reported,"Whether clinician or patient report, the core concept is that movement is full. Reporting is contextual and does not add attributes like body site or timing. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 277972004 correctly represents 'Full movement.' Other qualifiers (e.g., 'normal') are broader and less specific than 'full.'"
217189008,Explosion caused by conflagration in tenement (event),Detonation triggered by conflagration in a tenement,"The concept captured is an explosion event, described as a detonation, triggered by a conflagration, with the site being a tenement. SNOMED CT category: Event. “Detonation” functions as a synonym for explosion in this context, and “triggered by” maintains causality equivalent to “caused by.” This matches SCTID 217189008 precisely. Parent terms lacking the tenement attribute and siblings involving different causes or venues would be less specific. No additional attributes are introduced beyond cause and location."
442364007,Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 vaccination status (observable entity),Influenza A (H1N1) vaccination status,"This wording explicitly names Influenza A subtype H1N1 and focuses on the vaccination status concept. As a status indicator, it is an Observable entity rather than a procedure or finding with a value. The best code is Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 vaccination status (442364007). More general parents (e.g., influenza vaccination status) lack the H1N1 specificity, and siblings for other subtypes (e.g., H3N2) are excluded by the explicit H1N1 reference. The parentheses format A(H1N1) is a standard synonym and does not alter the concept."
299927006,Absent pin prick discrimination (finding),Exam shows absent pinprick discrimination,"This sentence documents the examination result of absent pinprick discrimination, directly reflecting the concept. No body site, cause, timing, or other modifiers are present. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, and the most precise code is SCTID 299927006. Using parent or sibling codes would either be overly general or misrepresent the severity/modal nature (e.g., decreased discrimination or absent sensation). The inclusion of 'Exam shows' is contextual and does not alter the finding."
735323002,Thoracic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient thoracic surgery care plan,"This phrasing conveys the same artifact: a care plan applying to thoracic surgery within the inpatient setting. The main concept is a documented plan of care tailored to thoracic surgical patients who are hospitalized. Category: Record artifact. The wording does not add attributes like phase of care, severity, or unit (e.g., ICU), so it remains general within the inpatient scope. It matches SNOMED CT 735323002 exactly and is tighter than broad parents such as Care plan or Surgical care plan. It excludes sibling concepts such as outpatient variants and non-thoracic surgical care plans, and it does not descend into child concepts that could specify procedure type or perioperative phase. “Care plan” and “plan of care” are clinically equivalent terms and do not change code selection."
40757004,Aphagia algera (finding),Swallowing cannot be performed due to pain,"The statement denotes that swallowing cannot be performed and cites pain as the reason, matching aphagia algera. The core concepts are inability to swallow and pain, categorized under Clinical finding. SCTID 40757004 is the most precise match. Odynophagia captures pain during swallowing without inability; aphagia lacks the pain qualifier; dysphagia is non-specific. This phrasing is a safe paraphrase that keeps the concept intact without introducing additional attributes."
441608000,Republic of the Marshall Islands (geographic location),The Republic of the Marshall Islands,"Adding 'The' does not alter meaning; it denotes the same country. The concept represented is the sovereign state as a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). This matches the target concept exactly; broader parent classes do not name the specific country, and related sibling entries would refer to other nations. The definite article adds no extra attributes or context and is a semantically equivalent paraphrase."
105180003,Ethoheptazine measurement (procedure),Ethoheptazine level measurement,"The phrase specifies measuring the ‘level’ of ethoheptazine, which is a standard clinical way to indicate quantification of a substance. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It fits Ethoheptazine measurement (procedure) because ‘level’ implies quantitative measurement; it does not imply detection or screening. Parent concepts are broader, and child concepts with specimen/method detail are not introduced here."
71213003,Arthrotomy of sternoclavicular joint for infection with drainage (procedure),Surgical opening and drainage of the sternoclavicular joint for infection,"‘Surgical opening’ of a joint equates to arthrotomy; drainage is included, as is the infection indication and sternoclavicular site. Category: Procedure. SCTID 71213003 matches the combination of arthrotomy plus drainage for infection at the sternoclavicular joint. Parent concepts are less specific without the indication/drainage, and siblings (arthroscopy, aspiration) would misstate technique. No added attributes such as debridement or irrigation appear."
223745004,Lesser Sunda island (geographic location),Patient reports being on a Lesser Sunda island,"The statement includes context of patient-reported presence but the codable concept is the geographic location: a single island within the Lesser Sunda Islands. Category: Geographic location. The phrasing does not imply the whole archipelago or any specific island; thus Lesser Sunda island is the most accurate code. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., archipelago-level) would be less precise, and child concepts (specific named islands) are not indicated. The context does not alter the location concept."
1812491000004107,Histologic grade of primary malignant neoplasm of prostate by International Society of Urological Pathology technique (observable entity),Histological grading per ISUP for primary prostate malignancy,"The wording indicates histological grading performed per ISUP for a primary prostate malignancy, which is the ISUP histologic grade observable. Main concepts: ISUP method, histological grade, primary malignant neoplasm of prostate. It is an Observable entity and maps to SCTID 1812491000004107. Parent concepts without technique are less precise, and Gleason or other grading systems would be siblings. No numeric grade is provided, ensuring it does not map to value-level child concepts."
268663007,Solitary stealing (finding),Theft carried out alone,"This wording indicates stealing performed alone, capturing the solitary attribute of the behavior. Category: Clinical finding. It is a direct match to 'Solitary stealing (finding)' and more specific than the parent concept 'Stealing (finding)' because it includes the solitary qualifier. It avoids introducing additional attributes like repetition, location, or motive, thereby not mapping to sibling concepts."
359920004,Repair of large omphalocele with prosthesis (procedure),Procedure performed—closure of large omphalocele with prosthetic patch,"This indicates the performed procedure is closure of a large omphalocele with a prosthetic patch. It is a Procedure category entry. The explicit size and prosthesis make SCTID 359920004 the most specific match. Concepts for closure without prosthesis or for unspecified size would not capture the documented details, and related procedures for small omphaloceles would be incorrect. 'Patch' is a common prosthetic form and is clinically equivalent to 'prosthesis' for coding purposes."
1365868009,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror of left buccal segment with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),Captured intraoral mirror image of the left buccal segment with teeth in CR.,"The statement documents a captured photographic intraoral image through mirror, focused on the left buccal segment, with teeth in CR (centric relation). This is the precise Record artifact SCTID 1365868009. The abbreviation 'CR' is clinically standard and equivalent to 'centric relation.' Parent concepts are too general, and siblings differ by view or laterality, which are correctly specified here."
242092009,Pedestrian trapped under motor vehicle wheel (event),Mechanism: pedestrian trapped under motor vehicle wheel.,"Stating ‘Mechanism’ frames the same event without adding injuries or intent; it describes a pedestrian trapped under the wheel of a motor vehicle. This belongs to the Event category and maps to SCTID 242092009. General transport mechanisms involving pedestrians are too broad, while specifying vehicle type or impact vs. entrapment would shift to sibling/child concepts. The synonymy is retained with the core idea of ‘trapped under motor vehicle wheel.’"
1236877003,Genetic pathology (qualifier value),Pathology etiology: genetic,"This entry frames the pathology’s etiology as genetic, which is clinically equivalent to 'genetic pathology' and serves as a qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, fitting SCTID 1236877003. A disorder concept would be inaccurate because the text conveys an attribute of pathology rather than a specific disease."
117100005,Human immune globulin product issued (situation),Human immune globulin product issued,"The main concept is the issuance of a human immune globulin product to a patient, describing a supply/dispense event rather than administration or ordering. This aligns with the SNOMED CT category Situation (situation with explicit context). The phrase explicitly states the product is human immune globulin and that it was issued, matching SCTID 117100005. Broader parents like 'Immunoglobulin product issued' would omit the human derivation, and children such as specific route (e.g., IVIG issued) or antigen-specific preparations would be overly specific and not stated. 'Immune globulin' here is a clinically standard synonym of 'immunoglobulin' and does not change code selection."
164176006,"Ear, nose and throat examination not performed (situation)",No E/N/T examination performed.,"The abbreviation E/N/T stands for ear, nose, and throat; the phrase states the exam was not performed, a Situation. SCTID 164176006 correctly represents ENT exam not performed. Parents that omit the ENT specificity are not precise, and siblings that add reasons or narrow the scope are inappropriate. The abbreviation is a conventional synonym and does not alter the code intent."
736351002,Breast surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Breast surgery inpatient care plan available,"This denotes that the breast surgery care plan in the inpatient context is available in the record, which maps to 'Breast surgery inpatient care plan' (736351002). Category: Record artifact. Generic care plan artifacts or surgical plans without breast specificity are less precise, and outpatient care plans are siblings that do not match the inpatient qualifier. 'Available' reflects presence and does not change the artifact’s identity or introduce new attributes."
411788002,Paspalum notatum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Bahia grass allergen diagnostic extract,"This refers to a diagnostic allergen extract sourced from Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), indicating a product for allergy testing. SNOMED CT category: product (pharmaceutical/biologic product). Using the common name does not alter the concept and remains uniquely codable to the Paspalum notatum diagnostic allergen extract. Generalized diagnostic extracts or other grass species would be less precise, and therapeutic forms would misrepresent the diagnostic intent."
225711009,Collection of nasal pharyngeal aspirate (procedure),Collection of NP aspirate,"This entry indicates the collection of a nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirate, a Procedure. It matches SCTID 225711009 by specifying the method (aspirate) and site (nasopharynx). Parent concepts (e.g., generic specimen collection) are too broad, and sibling procedures (NP swab, nasal aspirate) describe different techniques or anatomical sites. The use of the NP abbreviation is clinically standard and does not add attributes or change the code selection."
182428009,Structure of collateral ligament of distal interphalangeal joint of middle finger (body structure),Collateral ligament at the distal interphalangeal joint of the long finger,"The term ""long finger"" is a common synonym for the middle finger, and the entry specifies the distal interphalangeal joint and its collateral ligament. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This exactly matches SCTID 182428009 because it identifies the collateral ligament of the middle finger DIP joint without specifying radial/ulnar sides or clinical states. Parent concepts for interphalangeal collateral ligaments would be too broad, while sibling concepts like PIP joint collateral ligaments are excluded by the explicit DIP reference."
411262001,Sodium-2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide (in water) (product),Sodium pyrithione in water,"This uses the clinically accepted synonym 'sodium pyrithione' for sodium-2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide and preserves the 'in water' attribute, identifying the same product formulation. The main concept is the product, and the SNOMED CT category is Product. It does not add any attributes such as concentration, route, or brand. A parent concept for sodium pyrithione product without specifying the aqueous vehicle would be too broad, and sibling concepts with different solvents or combined ingredients would be inaccurate. Thus, it maps precisely to SCTID 411262001."
399419008,"No organ AND/OR tissue, other than fallopian tube, macroscopically involved by tumor (finding)","Surgeon’s note: grossly, no organ or tissue beyond the fallopian tube is involved by tumor","The surgeon’s gross assessment confirms that only the fallopian tube may be involved, with no macroscopic involvement of any other organ or tissue, which directly matches SNOMED CT 399419008. This is a Clinical finding based on macroscopic observation. It avoids additional attributes such as staging or microscopic data. A parent concept asserting no macroscopic involvement anywhere would be inaccurate, and a sibling focusing on single named organs (e.g., uterus) would be too specific. The phrasing “grossly” is a standard synonym for “macroscopically” and preserves the concept."
1153602009,Body mass index for age percentile (observable entity),Follow-up: BMI-for-age percentile,"This places the observable within a follow-up context but does not specify values, timing details beyond the label, or interpretations. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It aligns with SCTID 1153602009, as the term unambiguously refers to BMI percentile standardized to age. Broader concepts like 'Follow-up observation' lack specificity; siblings such as 'BMI percentile' without the age qualifier or 'Weight-for-age percentile' are not appropriate."
411947006,Atriplex lentiformis specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic preparation: Atriplex lentiformis allergen extract,"The phrase labels the item as a diagnostic preparation and specifies it is an allergen extract from Atriplex lentiformis, aligning with a diagnostic product. This corresponds to SCTID 411947006 in the Pharmaceutical/biologic product hierarchy. It lacks details on route, dosing, or specific testing method, avoiding misclassification to child concepts. Broader parent codes without species specificity would be less precise than this species-specific diagnostic extract."
251651006,Cervical mucus pH (observable entity),Cervical mucus pH analyte,"Referring to pH as the “analyte” in cervical mucus indicates the exact observable being considered. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 251651006 is the specific concept. This does not imply the act of testing (procedure) or a result; it merely names the property. Choosing a parent like generic analyte pH or a sibling such as other cervical secretion measurements would be less accurate. The term is a clinically safe synonym for the observable."
463138009,"Injectable vocal cord medialization implant, human-derived (physical object)",Patient reports a human-derived injectable implant to medialize the vocal cord,"This patient-reported statement still centers on a physical implant: injectable, intended for vocal cord medialization, and human-derived. That combination maps to SNOMED CT 463138009 (Physical object). Although the phrasing references the clinical purpose, it does not describe the procedure; it identifies the object. Parent implants lacking injectability or human origin are less specific, and sibling implants with synthetic or animal-derived materials would be inconsistent with the stated source."
421899008,Open loop anterior chamber lens (physical object),Open-loop AC IOL (intraocular lens),"This entry uses standard clinical abbreviations and expands them to ensure clarity: AC for anterior chamber and IOL for intraocular lens, with the open-loop design noted. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). It maps to SCTID 421899008 because it specifies a lens designed for the anterior chamber with open-loop haptics. A parent without the haptic design is less specific, while siblings like closed-loop AC IOLs or posterior chamber IOLs are different devices. The synonymic phrasing remains equivalent and does not add attributes such as laterality or material."
223771000,Panay (geographic location),Diagnostic report location: Panay,"The phrasing places Panay as a location reference within a report context but does not introduce procedural, temporal, or relational attributes—only the geographic entity is named. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Panay (geographic location), SCTID 223771000, is the precise match. Mapping to parent regions or sibling islands would be incorrect, and no child localities are specified. The “diagnostic report” label is contextual metadata and does not change code selection."
14103001,Product containing opioid receptor antagonist (product),Opioid antagonist medicinal product,"Using “opioid antagonist” as a synonym for “opioid receptor antagonist” is clinically accurate, and “medicinal product” fixes the product-level intent. Category: Product. The entry does not add attributes such as ingredient specificity, dose form, or route and thus fits SCTID 14103001. Parent or sibling classes would be either broader or different (e.g., agonists), which are not indicated here."
284544002,Crossroads (environment),Found at a road junction,"The phrase states the location as a road junction, synonymous with a crossroads, without adding other details. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (environment). It best matches Crossroads (environment) [284544002] and avoids specifying subtype or control features. More general parents (e.g., road) are less specific, and sibling concepts like roundabout or pedestrian crossing are not suggested by the entry. The synonym preserves the same environment meaning for coding."
1351941003,Structure of soft tissue of joint region of hand (body structure),Exam focus area: periarticular soft tissues of hand,"This entry references periarticular soft tissues in the hand as the exam focus, aligning with the Body structure 'Structure of soft tissue of joint region of hand' (1351941003). 'Exam focus area' is a contextual qualifier and does not modify the anatomical semantics. Using 'periarticular' equates to 'joint region' soft tissue. Parent concepts for all hand soft tissues are too broad, and child concepts naming specific joint regions are too narrow. Sibling concepts for wrist or non-soft tissue structures are excluded by the wording."
442931000124103,Adult soy protein isolate formula (product),Inventory item: adult soy protein isolate formula,"This inventory description names a product that is an adult-focused formula based on soy protein isolate. Attributes: adult, soy protein isolate, formula product. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 442931000124103 is the precise match, reflecting adult soy protein isolate formula. Parent concepts would omit the adult qualifier; sibling concepts (e.g., infant formulations or soy isolate supplements) differ by age group or product class. The inventory context adds no attributes like form or route."
1145142009,Structure of metatarsophalangeal joint region of fourth toe (body structure),Mapping anchor: 4th toe MTPJ region,"This describes an anatomical mapping reference point and identifies the region around the metatarsophalangeal joint of the fourth toe, consistent with SNOMED CT 1145142009 (Body structure). The contextual label does not introduce clinical attributes; the coded target remains the site. It is more specific than a parent concept without toe numbering, and by stating 'region' it avoids a sibling concept that would refer to the joint structure alone. 'MTPJ' is a standard abbreviation and does not alter the semantic equivalence."
398023000,Range constraints (qualifier value),Bounded range constraints,"Bounded range constraints denotes constraints that use a bounded interval, directly aligning with range constraints semantics. This is in the Qualifier value category, and Range constraints (398023000) is the accurate code because the wording solely captures a constraint defined by a range. No additional attributes such as endpoint type, normal/reference status, or domain are introduced. The phrase is a valid synonym that leaves code selection unchanged."
16471006,Entire macula cribrosa superior (body structure),Macula cribrosa superioris,"This Latinized form (superioris) refers to the same sieve-like superior macula in the fundus of the internal acoustic meatus. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. Clinically, it is equivalent to macula cribrosa superior and selects SCTID 16471006. It excludes parent macula cribrosa (unspecified) and distinguishes from basalis/media sibling regions by the explicit 'superior' qualifier. No laterality or other attributes are present."
736368003,Coronary heart disease care plan (record artifact),Coronary heart disease plan of care,"This entry uses the clinically equivalent term “plan of care,” which is a common synonym for “care plan,” and specifies coronary heart disease as its focus. No extra attributes are introduced. As a Record artifact, it maps most precisely to SCTID 736368003. Parent-level “Care plan” lacks the CHD focus; sibling or child concepts aimed at other cardiac disorders are not appropriate. The disorder concept is not chosen because this is a documentation artifact describing planned care, not a disease."
30131000087101,Antigen of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus-like particle (substance),Antigen from SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles,"This entry describes the antigen originating from SARS-CoV-2 VLPs, aligning exactly with an antigen of a SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It remains specific to VLP-derived antigen rather than any general viral antigen, avoiding a parent concept. It also does not name a particular protein, so child or sibling subtypes (e.g., spike protein antigen) are excluded. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to the preferred term, preserving identity and scope."
108649005,Product containing piperidine derivative (product),Piperidine derivative medication product,"Stating “medication product” indicates a medicinal product, and “piperidine derivative” denotes the ingredient class, matching the SNOMED CT pharmaceutical/biologic product for products containing piperidine derivatives. It is not a substance record and does not introduce formulation, dose, or specific derivative details, so the general product-containing class is the most exact fit."
713207007,Block dissection of cervical lymph nodes not done (situation),No cervical lymph node block dissection.,"The concise statement 'No cervical lymph node block dissection' conveys the absence of this specific procedure having been performed, which constitutes a 'procedure not done' situation. Category: Situation with explicit context. The exact code SCTID 713207007 applies, as it refers to block dissection of cervical lymph nodes not done. Using a general 'procedure not done' concept would be less specific, and mapping to related procedures (e.g., neck dissection, radical neck dissection) would be incorrect because only the block dissection of cervical lymph nodes is referenced."
720377006,Lithium electrolyte (substance),Substance recorded—lithium electrolyte,"The documentation context denotes a recorded substance and identifies it as 'lithium electrolyte.' The core concept is a Substance, matching SCTID 720377006. It does not include additional attributes (e.g., salt type, concentration, clinical purpose). Parent concepts like Lithium (substance) or sibling classes like Electrolyte (substance) lack the combined specificity, so this code is optimal."
411757001,Pimenta dioica diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allspice diagnostic allergen extract,"Allspice is the common name for Pimenta dioica, making this a clinically equivalent synonym for the same diagnostic allergen product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The phrasing indicates a diagnostic allergen extract without introducing procedure details or concentration, aligning with 411757001. Broader parent terms lack the source specificity, while sibling products from other spices or non-diagnostic (therapeutic) allergen extracts would not match the diagnostic intent conveyed here."
224996000,Appropriate growth (finding),Patient reports growing appropriately,"A patient-reported context still conveys the same clinical finding: that growth is appropriate. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. Appropriate growth (finding) SCTID 224996000 is the correct code because the statement does not add attributes (e.g., age/gestational qualifiers, specific measurements, development status). It remains distinct from related concepts such as abnormal growth or normal growth and development."
286781002,Character trait finding of level of suggestibility (finding),History: level of suggestibility as a trait,"Within a history note, this documents the level of suggestibility framed as a trait. The concept remains a Clinical finding and maps to SNOMED CT 286781002. No severity, timing change, or associated conditions are stated, so it does not imply an alternative concept. The trait framing prevents confusion with situational behavior findings."
225567004,Appearance of cornea (observable entity),Visual appearance of cornea,"The entry refers to the visual appearance of the cornea, which is equivalent to 'Appearance of cornea' and remains an observable parameter. No modifiers or result states are included. It should be coded to SCTID 225567004 (Observable entity). Parent observables that are broader, and specific pathologic findings that are narrower, are not appropriate here. The synonym 'visual appearance' is clinically safe and does not add attributes."
248843009,Vaginal hymen finding (finding),Female genital—hymen finding,"This phrasing indicates a clinical finding of the hymen within the female genital context, without specifying any particular condition. The concept is a Clinical finding and aligns with Vaginal hymen finding (248843009). It is more specific than general female genital findings and avoids implying child/sibling concepts such as intact hymen, hymenal tear, or hymenal variants. The wording serves as a synonym and retains the same code."
223839004,Sardinia (geographic location),Charted geographic place: Sardinia,"The wording denotes Sardinia as a charted geographic place, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 223839004 in the Location hierarchy. The contextual phrase “charted geographic place” does not alter the concept or add attributes like timing or causation. Parent concepts such as Italy would be insufficiently specific, and child entities within Sardinia would be overly detailed relative to the entry. The statement does not imply any sibling location. Therefore, Sardinia (geographic location) is the precise selection."
232839003,Operation on implanted aortic valve (procedure),Procedure performed on aortic valve prosthesis,"This phrasing documents that a procedure was performed on the prosthetic aortic valve, which is synonymous with an implanted aortic valve. It belongs to the Procedure category and matches the concept of operation on the implanted aortic valve. It avoids additional attributes such as approach, specific action, or cause, so child concepts like 'revision' or 'explantation' would be too specific. Parent concepts for generic aortic valve operations are less appropriate because native valve surgeries are excluded by the prosthesis reference."
242774005,Accident caused by safety pin (event),Accidental safety pin event,"The entry conveys an accidental event associated with a safety pin; the semantics indicate an accident attributable to the object without implying injury details. In SNOMED CT, the correct category is Event, with the specific concept “Accident caused by safety pin” (242774005). A parent like “Accidental event” fails to capture the specific cause, and sibling codes for different instruments or non-accidental contact would be mismatches. The phrase is a safe synonym consistent with the same external cause."
242866001,Assault by torture with electric current (event),Assault by torture with electric current,"Main concept: intentional assault characterized specifically by torture using electric current. No added attributes of severity, timing, or location are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Event. This wording exactly matches SCTID 242866001. Broader parents such as “Assault by torture (event)” lack the explicit electrical mechanism, and siblings like “Assault by electric shock (event)” omit the torture component. The entry uses the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
1167365001,Dual energy X-ray photon absorptiometry lumbar spine scan T score (observable entity),Lumbar spine DXA T-score,"The entry identifies the T-score derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for the lumbar spine, which corresponds exactly to the observable entity for the lumbar spine DXA T score (SCTID 1167365001). The main concept is a standardized T-score and the explicit site is lumbar spine, with the method implied by “DXA.” This is an Observable entity, not a procedure or interpretation. More general parent concepts like a generic DXA T-score or a non-site-specific T-score would be less precise, and sibling concepts such as Z-score or T-scores at other skeletal sites would be incorrect given the wording. “DXA” is a clinically equivalent synonym of “dual-energy X-ray photon absorptiometry,” and does not alter the code selection."
568101000005109,Hemoglobin variant not detected (finding),No variant hemoglobin identified,"The wording denotes that testing identified no variant hemoglobin, which is a negative result for hemoglobin variants. This Clinical finding corresponds to Hemoglobin variant not detected (finding). It avoids specifying methods, timing, or variant types. Parent concepts related to general hemoglobin findings or normal results are broader, and children/siblings tied to specific variants or positive detection do not match. 'Identified' versus 'detected' does not change the semantics."
302002000,Difficulty moving (finding),Problem list: difficulty moving,"As a problem-list entry, this indicates a general clinical finding of difficulty moving without severity, timing, etiology, or anatomical specificity. The main concept is difficulty moving in the Clinical finding category. The exact SNOMED CT code is Difficulty moving (finding) SCTID 302002000. More specific concepts (walking difficulty, immobility, stiffness) are not supported, and broader parent terms are less exact. The phrasing is a direct representation of the concept."
89830004,Osteoclasis of radius (procedure),Procedure performed: radius osteoclasis,"This entry documents that the performed procedure is osteoclasis on the radius. Attributes explicitly stated are the procedure (osteoclasis) and site (radius), without qualifying laterality, approach, or indication. Category: Procedure. The closest and most precise SNOMED CT concept is Osteoclasis of radius (SCTID 89830004). Parent concepts are insufficiently specific, and child concepts with added technique details (open/closed) or laterality are not present. Siblings like osteotomy of radius or fracture reduction are distinct and therefore incorrect. The 'performed' context does not change the concept; it simply affirms the procedure."
242698009,Accidentally struck by falling street furniture (event),Unintentional impact from falling street furniture,"This entry describes the same event: an unintentional (accidental) impact resulting from street furniture that fell. The attributes are accidental nature, impact/strike, and falling street furniture as the source. The SNOMED CT category is Event. 'Unintentional' is a synonym of 'accidental' and 'impact' a synonym of 'struck', both maintaining the same meaning without introducing additional attributes. It maps specifically to SCTID 242698009 rather than a parent like 'struck by falling object', and does not suggest an injury diagnosis or a different mechanism."
714093000,Sexually active in last six months (finding),Sexual activity within the past half-year.,"Half-year is an exact synonym for six months, and the entry states sexual activity occurred in that interval, matching SNOMED CT 714093000 (Clinical finding). More general or differently timed sexual activity concepts would be less accurate. The synonym 'half-year' does not change the clinical meaning or add attributes."
223610001,Jordan (geographic location),Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,"This is the official name of the country Jordan and is a clinically safe synonym for the same geographic entity, matching Jordan (geographic location), SCTID 223610001. Category: Location (Geographic location). It does not introduce different attributes or a different granularity. Parent concepts such as Country or Geographic location are less precise, and children (e.g., Amman) or siblings (other countries or the Jordan River) are not implied."
122635003,Specimen from stomach obtained by partial gastrectomy (specimen),Patient reports stomach tissue removed by partial gastrectomy was sent as a specimen,"A patient-reported statement about stomach tissue removed through partial gastrectomy being submitted as a specimen. Main concepts: specimen, stomach site, partial gastrectomy procurement. Category: Specimen. Despite the patient voice, the clinical content aligns exactly with the concept of a specimen from stomach obtained by partial gastrectomy. Parent concepts lack the procedural detail, and siblings representing other methods would not fit. No cause, diagnosis, or additional attributes are added."
371546007,Educational visit report (record artifact),Educational visit report scanned,"The entry identifies the artifact (educational visit report) and notes it has been scanned, a processing detail that does not alter the report’s nature. The main concept is the record artifact of an educational visit. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Educational visit report (SCTID: 371546007) is the most specific match; generic parents or sibling concepts (e.g., “scanned document” without visit type) are less appropriate because the educational visit context is explicit. No clinical attributes are added beyond identifying the document."
768766000,Product containing mercury and/or mercury compound (product),Inventory record: product containing mercury,"This entry documents a product with mercury content in an inventory context, which aligns with the concept without adding new attributes. The main concept is a product containing mercury; no specific product subtype is provided. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 768766000 best represents this because it covers products containing mercury and/or mercury compounds. Parent concepts are too broad, while child or sibling concepts for particular mercury-containing items are not specified. The inventory framing does not alter the semantic equivalence to the target concept."
443483005,Inadequate sleep hygiene (finding),Follow-up note: suboptimal sleep hygiene,"In follow-up context, 'suboptimal sleep hygiene' denotes the same finding as inadequate sleep hygiene, aligning with SNOMED CT 443483005 (Clinical finding). The entry refrains from adding temporal qualifiers beyond the section header and includes no causes or associated diagnoses, so it does not fit parent or sibling concepts. 'Suboptimal' is a clinically equivalent synonym."
72573008,Infraspinatus muscle structure (body structure),Identified rotator cuff component—the infraspinatus muscle,"This denotes the infraspinatus muscle as a component of the rotator cuff, clearly naming the muscle structure itself. It is a Body structure and maps to SCTID 72573008. Parent concepts like rotator cuff structure are too general, and siblings such as supraspinatus are not applicable. The phrasing does not add pathology or laterality, keeping the concept precise."
223925003,County Tyrone (geographic location),"County Tyrone, NI","“NI” is a common abbreviation for Northern Ireland, used here only for context, while the core entity is County Tyrone. This maps directly to SNOMED CT concept 223925003 in the Location → Geographic location category. The entry does not imply a parent mapping to Northern Ireland or a child mapping to a town. The mention remains precisely the county, making County Tyrone the correct and most specific code selection."
261995001,Non-pulsatile (qualifier value),Impression: non-pulsatile,"An impression statement noting the quality as non-pulsatile, with no other attributes. This matches SNOMED CT 261995001 Non-pulsatile (qualifier value), Qualifier value. It does not specify a phenomenon (so child concepts are not appropriate) and does not claim absence of a pulse, avoiding misclassification as a clinical finding."
702880004,Lymphedema clinic (environment),Clinic site: lymphedema clinic,"The wording identifies the site as a clinic for lymphedema, which is an environment concept. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This maps to SCTID 702880004, describing the exact clinic type by condition focus. Parent concepts like Clinic (environment) are too general, and sibling or child concepts that add modality or population are not implied. The phrase remains within environmental designation without adding other attributes, justifying the specific code."
431205006,Specimen from epididymis obtained by biopsy (specimen),Biopsy of epididymis—specimen submitted,"This submission note identifies the specimen as derived from a biopsy of the epididymis. Main concept: specimen; attributes: anatomical site (epididymis) and acquisition method (biopsy). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. While it mentions the procedure, the key coded entity is the specimen; this aligns directly with 431205006. A parent “epididymis specimen” or a sibling using another method would be less precise."
66031007,Structure of glossopharyngeal nerve inferior ganglion (body structure),Anatomy checklist: glossopharyngeal inferior ganglion,"This checklist entry specifies the inferior ganglion associated with the glossopharyngeal nerve and does not include any additional attributes. It references a Body structure. The most precise SNOMED CT mapping is Structure of glossopharyngeal nerve inferior ganglion (SCTID 66031007). Choosing the parent ‘glossopharyngeal nerve’ would be overly broad, while the sibling ‘superior (jugular) ganglion’ is excluded by the ‘inferior’ wording. The phrase is a straightforward synonym of the preferred term and does not change the concept."
773760007,Traumatic event (event),Traumatic event documented,"This entry indicates documentation of a traumatic event without adding detail about timing, mechanism, or outcomes; the core concept remains an event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 773760007 is exact, as the documentation context does not transform it into a finding or disorder. Parent Event would be less specific, and sibling concepts like Accident (event) or Assault (event) would add specificity not provided. The phrase is equivalent to the base concept with a documentation context."
216423009,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, children's home (environment)",Place of occurrence: children's home,"The entry states the location where the accident or poisoning occurred as a children's home, directly matching the SNOMED CT concept 'Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, children's home (environment)'. This is an Environment category concept that encodes the site of the event without adding clinical details. It is more precise than the parent 'place of occurrence of accident or poisoning (environment)' and more accurate than sibling locations like private home, school, or daycare. The phrasing is a straightforward location descriptor and does not introduce timing, cause, or severity, so the code 216423009 is the most appropriate."
86244002,Structure of left epididymis (body structure),Exam landmark: left epididymis,"This entry refers to the left epididymis as a landmark for examination, identifying only the anatomical structure and side. It conforms to the Body structure category and adds no pathologic or segmental detail. A parent concept without laterality is less exact, and the right side is incorrect. No child-level subparts are specified. The best match is Structure of left epididymis (86244002)."
258769000,Unit of volume (qualifier value),Unit of volume,"The entry explicitly names the concept 'Unit of volume,' which is a SNOMED CT Qualifier value representing the class of units used to express volume. No specific unit (e.g., liter, milliliter) is mentioned, so child concepts are not implied. It is more specific than the parent 'Unit of measure' and does not align with sibling categories like 'Unit of length' or 'Unit of mass.' The wording matches SCTID 258769000 exactly, with no added attributes such as magnitude, timing, or per-time factors."
60583000,Postaxial (qualifier value),Postaxial descriptor selected,"The wording indicates that the selected descriptor is 'postaxial', i.e., the axial qualifier. No additional clinical attributes are added. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value and the exact code is 60583000. It avoids site-specific alternatives and does not suggest a disorder, ensuring the most accurate mapping is the postaxial qualifier rather than a parent or sibling concept."
78175001,Glutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (substance),Identified substance is glutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase,"The phrase confirms the identity of the substance as glutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, the specific enzyme. It should be coded as a Substance in SNOMED CT using SCTID 78175001. No attributes such as activity level, disease involvement, source organism, or formulation are added. Parents like Enzyme (substance) and sibling enzymes (e.g., glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase) would be less accurate given the precise identification."
25986004,"Hospital admission, under police custody (procedure)",Admission to hospital in police custody.,"This describes the procedure of admission to a hospital with the defining attribute that the patient was in police custody. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The explicit inclusion of police custody ensures a unique match to 25986004, whereas a general admission without that qualifier would map to a parent concept. No other qualifiers (e.g., emergency status, unit, or cause) are present, avoiding any drift toward sibling concepts."
162023004,No problem swallowing (situation),Chart note: swallowing problem absent,"This entry explicitly states the absence of a swallowing problem, a negated clinical assertion without additional qualifiers. It maps to SNOMED’s Situation category, with the exact match “No problem swallowing (situation)” SCTID 162023004. Parent negative symptom categories are overly general, and siblings such as ‘normal swallow’ or ‘presence of dysphagia’ do not represent a negated problem. ‘Problem absent’ is a clinically equivalent phrasing that maintains the same code."
442664003,Swelling of right tonsil (finding),Right tonsil edema,"The entry conveys edema (swelling) of the right tonsil; ‘edema’ is clinically synonymous with ‘swelling’ in this context. This is a Clinical finding. Swelling of right tonsil (SCTID 442664003) is the correct code because it represents tonsillar swelling with right laterality. A parent like ‘tonsil swelling’ would be less specific, and codes for hypertrophy or infection would misrepresent the described finding. The synonym ‘edema’ does not introduce causation or severity."
116808005,Transfusion of cryo-poor plasma (procedure),Blood bank record—cryo-poor plasma transfusion,"Contextualizing in a blood bank record does not alter the clinical act: transfusion of cryo-poor plasma. The core concept is the Procedure involving cryoprecipitate-depleted plasma, mapping directly to SNOMED CT 116808005. Parent concepts such as nonspecific plasma transfusion are less precise, and siblings like cryoprecipitate transfusion are inappropriate given the specified product. No extra attributes (e.g., volume, timing) are introduced; it remains uniquely codable."
263914008,Uncomplicated (qualifier value),Entry: uncomplicated,"The entry is the qualifier ‘uncomplicated,’ with the label ‘Entry’ serving as contextual metadata and not altering the clinical concept. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. 263914008 is the correct code as it represents the classification modifier. Sibling concepts (e.g., ‘Complicated’) or situation/findings would misrepresent the intent. No additional attributes are present."
405624007,Administrative documentation (record artifact),Follow-up note: administrative documentation,"This entry references administrative documentation within a follow-up note context but still points to the non-clinical record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, with Administrative documentation (record artifact) 405624007 as the precise match. No specific subtype (consent, billing) is implied, and it does not become clinical documentation. Thus, siblings or children are less appropriate. It is more specific than a generic documentation parent due to the administrative designation."
368659004,Entire subcutaneous tissue of supraorbital area (body structure),Anatomy noted: entire subcutaneous tissue of the supraorbital area,"The central concept is the entire subcutaneous tissue of the supraorbital area, noted in an anatomical documentation context. Attributes are tissue type (subcutaneous) and location (supraorbital), with completeness ('entire'). The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This aligns with SCTID 368659004, as it precisely identifies the whole layer at this site. Parent or sibling concepts would either lack the completeness detail or target different tissues or regions. The documentation context does not introduce any non-anatomical attributes."
721927009,Referral note (record artifact),Referral document,"The phrase denotes the document that conveys a referral, fitting the Record artifact category. The precise code is Referral note (record artifact) SCTID 721927009, as it identifies the documentation artifact rather than the act of referral. It is not better mapped to a broader parent like Document (record artifact), because 'referral' is specified, nor to sibling document types. No timing, destination, or clinical details are added."
761938008,Medicinal prescription record (record artifact),Medication prescription record,"The phrase describes a record documenting a prescription for medication, clearly a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 761938008 matches because it is defined as a medicinal prescription record. Choosing a parent such as Record artifact would lose specificity, and selecting related concepts such as Medication order (procedure/situation) or Medication administration record would misinterpret the entry as an action or administration log. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym focused solely on the record of a medicinal prescription."
43305003,Protein-tyrosine kinase (substance),Protein-tyrosine kinase class,"The wording indicates the class of protein-tyrosine kinases as a substance group, with no mention of receptor subtype, activity levels, inhibition, or specific members. In SNOMED CT, this fits the Substance hierarchy and is best represented by 43305003. A broader parent like “Protein kinase” is not specific enough, and narrower children/siblings such as receptor tyrosine kinases or individual kinases would add detail not present in the text; the general PTK substance concept is the exact match."
272282004,Tray or applicator for topical oral medication (physical object),Delivery tray for topical oral drugs,"The phrase describes a tray used to deliver drugs topically in the mouth, matching a physical device intended for topical oral application. Category: Physical object. It avoids procedural or therapeutic details and does not specify the medication, keeping it at the correct granularity. Parent concepts (e.g., drug delivery device unspecified site) are too broad; child concepts with specific drugs or designs are not supported by the wording. The synonym does not alter the code selection."
789538006,Postcoital oral contraceptive prescribed (situation),Clinical summary: morning-after oral contraceptive was prescribed.,"This clinical summary states that a morning-after oral contraceptive was prescribed, which is a synonym for a postcoital oral contraceptive pill. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 789538006 is the appropriate code because it captures the prescribing of a postcoital oral contraceptive. Broader parents or siblings covering administration, dispensing, device-based emergency contraception, or counseling would be misaligned with the precise action of prescribing described here."
223635007,Austria (geographic location),Facility country: Austria,"Austria is specified as the country where a facility is located, which is a geographic location value. Category: Geographic location (Location). The context does not change the geographic identity or require a child/sibling concept. Parent regions are overly broad. Hence, Austria (geographic location) 223635007 is the most precise code."
432058006,Specimen from skeletal muscle obtained by biopsy (specimen),Skeletal muscle specimen from biopsy,"This entry identifies a specimen, specifies the tissue type (skeletal muscle), and states it was obtained by biopsy. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It matches SCTID 432058006 as it neither adds granularity (like specific muscle) nor omits key elements (biopsy method). Parent concepts lacking biopsy or child concepts with additional attributes are not invoked by this wording."
282337009,Unit of blood analysis (qualifier value),Testing qualifier: unit of blood analysis,"This entry designates the qualifier for testing as ‘unit of blood analysis,’ reflecting how the test result is expressed. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It correctly matches SCTID 282337009, focusing on the analytical denominator, not a specimen type or product. Parent concepts would be less specific; siblings for other specimen types are not appropriate. The synonymic phrasing does not add or change clinical attributes."
702934002,Pediatric surgery clinic (environment),Record location: pediatric surgery clinic,"This indicates the location associated with a record, specifically a pediatric surgery clinic environment. No extra attributes are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (environment). The exact match is 702934002. More general parents or different sibling environments (departments/wards) are not reflected in the entry."
264180000,Right sided (qualifier value),Laterality confirmed as right-sided,"This indicates confirmation of the laterality attribute as right-sided, with no additional clinical details. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 264180000 is the exact code for 'Right sided'. Parent laterality would be too general, and sibling qualifiers represent different sides. The confirmation wording does not alter the attribute; it remains equivalent to right-sided laterality."
106511000119106,Long-term current use of mycophenolate (situation),Active medication: mycophenolate (long-term use),"This documentation note identifies mycophenolate as an active medication and specifies it is long-term use, indicating current ongoing therapy. As a Situation capturing medication status, it precisely matches 106511000119106. It does not introduce formulation-specific details or any indication, keeping it distinct from parent categories lacking drug specificity and child concepts tied to particular salt forms."
309494003,Ampulla of Vater biopsy specimen (specimen),Specimen type: biopsy; site: ampulla of Vater,"The structured phrasing states the specimen type (biopsy) and the anatomical site (ampulla of Vater) without extra qualifiers, matching a Specimen concept. SNOMED CT 309494003 is the correct code due to specificity. Parent terms like biopsy specimen without site are too broad, and siblings like excision specimen or papilla of Vater biopsy specimen describe different methods or sites. The structured format is a clinically equivalent expression of the same concept."
40561000284102,Dark blue color (qualifier value),Dark blue hue documented.,"The documentation indicates a hue of “dark blue,” solely a color qualifier. As a Qualifier value, Dark blue color (40561000284102) is the exact match. Parent Blue color is less specific, and sibling values such as light blue would be incorrect. The use of “hue” is a synonym for color and does not alter the code selection or introduce other attributes."
161465002,History of dementia (situation),Discharge summary: history of dementia,"In a discharge summary, listing dementia as history reflects a contextual situation rather than active disorder status. This falls under Situation with explicit context. 'History of dementia (situation)' is the specific code, more precise than a parent history concept, and more accurate than 'Dementia (disorder)' for this wording. No subtype or familial context is suggested."
224019009,Nova Scotia (geographic location),Residence: Nova Scotia,"Although the context label suggests a residency field, the value to be coded as a location is Nova Scotia. The main concept remains the place name, which fits the SNOMED CT Geographic location category. The best code is Nova Scotia (geographic location) SCTID 224019009 because only the province is specified; the residence context does not imply a different SNOMED concept in this task. It does not generalize to Canada nor specify a child municipality. The wording is context-only and keeps the location unchanged."
390910005,Thrombolysis contraindicated (situation),Nursing documentation: thrombolysis contraindicated,"This nursing note records that thrombolysis is contraindicated, without any added detail about reasons, timing, or specific agents. The category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 390910005 is the accurate match because it is specific to thrombolysis. Parent concepts describing any procedure contraindication are overly broad, and siblings involving other therapies or non-indication are mismatches. The documentation context maintains equivalence to the core concept."
70081006,Structure of anterior basal branch of right pulmonary artery (body structure),Anterior basal branch of right pulmonary artery,"The entry names the specific anatomical branch of the right pulmonary artery that serves the anterior basal segment, corresponding to the segmental artery commonly referred to as A8. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This wording precisely matches SCTID 70081006 and does not introduce any pathology or other attributes. A broader parent such as 'Structure of right pulmonary artery' would be less specific, while sibling branches (e.g., lateral basal or posterior basal) would be incorrect. The phrasing is a direct synonym of the preferred term without changing semantic scope."
468794000,Endoscopic video imaging system (physical object),Endoscopic video imaging system powered on,"Operational status ('powered on') is noted, but the entry clearly identifies the endoscopic video imaging system, a Physical object (device). No attributes beyond status are present, avoiding mapping to parent generic video systems or to component-level devices. Therefore, the endoscopic video imaging system code (468794000) remains the most specific and accurate representation."
782660000,Combined upper and lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy report (record artifact),GI endoscopy report for both upper and lower tracts,"The wording specifies a gastrointestinal endoscopy report that covers the upper and lower tracts, i.e., a combined document. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and SCTID 782660000 is the exact concept. Parent concepts (general GI endoscopy report) fail to capture that both tracts are included, and siblings for individual tract reports would be incomplete. The phrasing targets the report artifact rather than the procedures or outcomes."
1304193006,Structure of apical inferior segment of 18-segment model of myocardium of left ventricle (body structure),Anatomic site: apical inferior LV myocardium segment (18-segment),"This documentation-style entry designates the anatomical site as the apical inferior segment of the LV myocardium and includes the 18-segment context, aligning precisely to SNOMED CT concept 1304193006 (Body structure). The phrase does not introduce pathology or procedure, remaining purely structural. More general parents (e.g., LV myocardium) do not capture segment-level specificity; siblings (apical anterior/lateral/septal) are ruled out by “inferior.” Reference to the 18-segment structure excludes concepts from other models, preserving code specificity."
735365008,Aspergillus quadrilineatus (organism),Laboratory naming: Aspergillus quadrilineatus,"This entry indicates the laboratory’s naming of the organism as Aspergillus quadrilineatus, purely identifying the species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 735365008 is the best match because it corresponds to the organism’s specific taxon. Parent concepts lack species specificity, and sibling species or child detection concepts are not conveyed. The phrase adds no clinical attributes, ensuring the selection remains the organism entity."
223746003,Timor (geographic location),Location: Timor,"The phrase identifies a location value of “Timor,” with the contextual label “Location” indicating the data field rather than changing the coded concept. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). This maps directly to 223746003 Timor (geographic location), not to the country Timor-Leste or regional qualifiers like West Timor. A parent like Southeast Asia would be too general, and siblings such as Timor Sea would be incorrect in type and scope."
304267002,Hydratase (substance),Hydratase substance record,"This wording indicates a reference to the hydratase substance, keeping the focus squarely on hydratase without adding attributes like usage or source. The main concept is hydratase. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It maps exactly to Hydratase (substance) [304267002], not to broader parent categories such as Enzyme (substance). No specific subtypes are stated, so child or sibling concepts are not implicated."
1359769003,Therapeutic thoracocentesis (procedure),Therapeutic evacuation of pleural fluid via thoracentesis,"This phrase describes therapeutic evacuation of pleural fluid using the thoracentesis technique, a procedure. The most accurate SNOMED CT concept is Therapeutic thoracocentesis (procedure), SCTID 1359769003. It is more specific than generic evacuation/drainage procedures and does not fit diagnostic-only variants or other techniques like needle thoracostomy."
1296749001,No evidence of glaucoma of left eye (situation),OS without evidence of glaucoma.,"OS denotes the left eye, and 'without evidence of glaucoma' asserts a negative finding. The concept is a Situation indicating absence-of-evidence for left-eye glaucoma. SCTID 1296749001 maps precisely due to the combination of 'no evidence' and left laterality. Parent concepts lacking laterality and siblings invoking different contexts (such as screening, ruling out, or disease absence as a separate modeling) do not match better. The synonym does not introduce additional attributes."
259903004,Salivary duct cell antibody (substance),Salivary ductal cell antibody,"This uses ‘ductal’ as a synonymous modifier for ‘duct,’ referring to the same anatomical cell target. No test result, patient status, or reagent subclass is implied. Category: Substance. The most precise code is 259903004, since the term maps exactly to an antibody specific for salivary duct cells. Parent categories (generic antibodies) or siblings (salivary gland antibodies) would be less accurate, and child concepts like specific isotypes are not mentioned. ‘Ductal’ is a clinically acceptable synonym that preserves meaning."
736376001,Infectious disease care plan (record artifact),Laboratory report: infectious disease care plan,"This indicates the infectious disease care plan within the context of a laboratory report while still referring to the record artifact itself. It cleanly maps to Infectious disease care plan (record artifact) [736376001]. The entry avoids any added attributes such as causative organism, severity, or timeframe, so neither a generic care plan nor a specific infection care plan would be a better fit."
420626004,Oklahoma (geographic location),The documented geographic location is the state of Oklahoma in the United States.,This narrative specifies the same place while adding documentation context without altering the core concept. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). It maps to Oklahoma (geographic location) SCTID 420626004. Mentioning the U.S. provides context but not a different concept; no patient or event attributes are introduced.
257636005,Vacation resort (environment),Social context environment entry: vacation resort,"The entry captures the environment in a social context as a vacation resort, with no extraneous attributes. This is most precisely represented by SNOMED CT 257636005, Vacation resort (environment), classified under Environment or geographical location. Using a broader environmental parent would be nonspecific, and selecting a sibling such as hotel or campground would misidentify the setting. The wording retains the intended environmental concept."
442210006,History of total excision of stomach (situation),S/P total gastrectomy,"“S/P” (status post) indicates a past procedure, and “total gastrectomy” specifies complete removal of the stomach. The main concept is historical context of total stomach excision. This belongs to the Situation with explicit context category. The code 442210006 for history of total excision of stomach is most precise; a generic status-post or history-of-gastrectomy concept without total specification would be overly broad, and the procedure concept for total gastrectomy would be inappropriate because the entry is not about performing the procedure now."
258497007,Abscess swab (specimen),Culture source: abscess swab,"Here, the source of a culture is specified as an abscess swab, and the core concept remains the specimen type. This belongs to the Specimen category and maps to Abscess swab (specimen), SCTID 258497007. Although a culture may be performed, the entry itself does not encode the procedure, only the specimen. Sibling concepts (e.g., pus swab) or child concepts with body-site qualifiers are not indicated, maintaining precise alignment."
256659007,Chondromucosal graft (substance),Cartilage-mucosa graft,"This entry names a graft composed of cartilage and mucosa, which is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of chondromucosal graft and introduces no additional attributes. Category: Substance. The precise match is SNOMED CT 256659007 because the material is defined by its dual tissue composition. Parent concepts (generic graft materials) are too broad, while sibling or child concepts specifying only one tissue type (e.g., cartilage graft) or a specific donor source (e.g., autograft) would add or remove attributes not present here. It does not imply any procedure, making substance the correct axis."
224041009,Arizona - United States of America state (geographic location),Arizona (USA),"This indicates the place Arizona with the country context USA, still denoting the state-level geographic entity. It maps to the Geographic location category. SCTID 224041009 is the most precise match, as it represents the U.S. state Arizona. Parent concepts such as 'United States of America' are too broad, while children/siblings (cities or other states) are not implied by the wording. The parenthetical country does not change the concept; it simply clarifies location."
110517009,Vertebral column and cranium (combined site) (body structure),Anatomical site label: skull and spine,"This labels the anatomical site as the skull (cranium) and the spine (vertebral column) together. It is a Body structure reference and matches SNOMED CT 110517009 exactly. No timing, laterality, severity, or causation is implied. More specific siblings like 'craniovertebral junction' or broader constructs like 'axial skeleton' would misrepresent the stated site. Therefore, the combined site code is the most precise mapping."
457550008,Escherichia coli serotype O172:H11 (organism),Escherichia coli O172:H11 serotype,"Main concept: The organism Escherichia coli with explicitly stated O172:H11 serotype. No context of infection, specimen, or resistance is provided. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The code 457550008 represents Escherichia coli serotype O172:H11 exactly, and this phrasing is equivalent. Choosing a broader parent (E. coli without serotype) would lose specificity; choosing any sibling serotype would not match the O172:H11 markers. The term order (organism then serotype) is a standard phrasing that retains the same meaning and code."
1306647007,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with lips closed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),"Facial extraoral image—left half at 45°, lips closed, jaws positioned in CR.","The phrase describes an extraoral facial image capturing the left half of the face at 45 degrees, with lips closed and jaws positioned in centric relation (CR). Category: Record artifact. It precisely fits SNOMED CT 1306647007 because it is an artifact with defined orientation, laterality, and positional attributes. Generic extraoral images are parent-level and less specific, and siblings with right-side views or non-CR jaw positions would be incorrect. “CR” is a standard shorthand and maintains equivalence."
80866009,"Streptococcus, group N (organism)",Laboratory organism designation: Streptococcus group N,"The entry assigns the organism designation as Streptococcus group N in a lab context, without adding clinical attributes. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It directly maps to SCTID 80866009. More general streptococcus is less accurate, and other groups or species are not indicated. No infection or site is implied, so organism code is the most precise match."
6588002,"Tertiary peristaltic contraction of esophagus, function (observable entity)",Esophagus tertiary contraction,"Although succinct, this entry identifies a contraction in the esophagus specified as tertiary, which maps to the observable entity Tertiary peristaltic contraction of esophagus, function (SCTID 6588002). It does not introduce severity, temporality, or causation; it purely denotes the functional motility pattern. Broader parent concepts for esophageal motility would not capture the tertiary specification, and sibling categories such as primary or secondary peristalsis would be inaccurate. The brevity does not change the concept."
303769008,Structure of abductor of metacarpophalangeal joint of finger (body structure),Abductor muscle serving the finger MCP joint,"The entry identifies the muscle that serves the abductor function at the finger MCP joint, an anatomical Body structure aligning with SNOMED CT 303769008. It precisely captures the concept (abductor, finger, MCP joint) without adding attributes like condition, laterality, or digit specificity, avoiding over-specific child mappings. It is not a parent concept because it retains joint specificity. Sibling concepts (adductor or thumb MCP abductor) are excluded. The phrase 'serving the finger MCP joint' conveys functional role without altering the intended anatomical code."
405995002,Type of fetal tissue present in specimen (observable entity),EHR field label: fetal tissue type in specimen,"The entry describes an EHR field that captures the observable for fetal tissue type in a specimen. The wording maintains a classification focus and does not introduce additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 405995002 is the correct code because it represents the data element for the type of fetal tissue present. Parents lacking fetal restriction are overly broad; siblings addressing different properties (e.g., presence) or children listing specific tissue values do not match the generic type attribute expressed here."
363922000,Characteristic of language (observable entity),Language characteristic value (unspecified),"This indicates the existence of a value for a language-related characteristic, but the type and value remain unspecified. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It maps to SCTID 363922000 as the general observable for language characteristics. The lack of specificity avoids mapping to child concepts such as preferred language or mother tongue, and it is narrower than the parent ‘characteristic of communication.’ The phrasing is equivalent to referencing the language characteristic observable."
216424003,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, dormitory (environment)",Follow-up: prior accident’s place of occurrence documented as dormitory,"A follow-up note confirms the dormitory as the previously documented place of occurrence of an accident, which maps to SNOMED CT 216424003. The main concept is the environmental place-of-occurrence, and the attribute is dormitory. Category: Environment. This is more specific than generic place-of-occurrence and does not suggest any other location. The entry remains free of added attributes such as time or severity, keeping it uniquely codable."
423876004,Clinical document (record artifact),Clinical document in the medical record,"Locating the document in the medical record keeps the focus on the artifact and identifies it as clinical in nature. This aligns with Clinical document (record artifact). There is no indication of a specific document class (report, note, summary), excluding child concepts. The clinical qualifier is why the parent document artifact is less precise."
736282001,Neonatal critical care plan (record artifact),Neonatal critical care treatment plan,"This entry conveys a treatment plan within the neonatal critical care setting, i.e., the plan artifact targeted to critical care for a neonate. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. 'Treatment plan' is a common synonym for 'care plan' in documentation and still refers to the record artifact, not a procedure. Parent concepts like Critical care plan miss the neonatal qualifier; siblings like Neonatal care plan may not imply critical care. The synonym does not add new attributes and remains uniquely codable to the given concept."
1293223004,Division of carpal bone (procedure),OR log entry: division of carpal bone,"An operating room log noting 'division of carpal bone' directly represents the procedure Division of carpal bone (1293223004) in the Procedure hierarchy. No details about approach, laterality, or named bone are added. It is more specific than a generic bone division parent and excludes siblings such as excision (carpectomy) or fusion (arthrodesis), supporting precise coding to the provided concept."
226340000,Monosaccharide intake (observable entity),Chart note: monosaccharide intake,"This entry places the observable monosaccharide intake within a chart note context, retaining the exact concept. It fits the Observable entity category and should be coded to Monosaccharide intake (226340000). Broader carbohydrate intake or sibling disaccharide intake would misrepresent scope, and specific monosaccharide types would be overly narrow. The documentation context does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
410309002,"Signs/symptoms-physical education, guidance, and counseling (procedure)",Physical signs and symptoms counseling documented,"This statement confirms counseling on physical signs and symptoms, which is the core educational procedure. Category is Procedure, and 410309002 is the exact match for education/guidance/counseling concerning physical signs/symptoms. A broader counseling documentation code would be imprecise; topic-specific children are not indicated. The wording is equivalent and does not add qualifiers such as severity or etiology."
846756007,No raised intracranial pressure (situation),Chart note: intracranial pressure is not high,"The wording 'not high' is equivalent to 'not elevated' in the context of intracranial pressure, stating the absence of raised ICP. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. No raised intracranial pressure (situation) [846756007] is the most precise mapping. Parent or sibling concepts—such as general ICP findings, raised ICP, or normal ICP measurements—are less appropriate because this entry only negates elevation without implying specific normal values or measurement context."
702844004,Cystic fibrosis clinic (environment),Attended the CF clinic,"A patient attendance statement that specifies the CF clinic directly references the cystic fibrosis clinic environment, mapping to Cystic fibrosis clinic (environment), SCTID 702844004. The main concept is the clinic environment; 'attended' is contextual and does not modify the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This is more precise than generic Clinic (environment) and not indicative of another facility type like a center. Hence, 702844004 is the best match."
4301000179109,Educational activity report (record artifact),Educational activity report added to the medical record,"This indicates that an educational activity report has been incorporated into the medical record; the artifact remains the report. Category: Record artifact. SCTID 4301000179109 is exact for a report about educational activity. Parent Record artifact lacks specificity, and siblings like Education session note or Training certificate would misclassify the document type. The administrative action does not change the underlying concept."
216334006,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, gravel pit (environment)",Follow-up: original accident location listed as gravel pit,"This follow-up entry references the original accident's place-of-occurrence, specifying 'gravel pit' and not introducing additional attributes. It maps to the Environment or geographical location category. The precise SNOMED CT code is 216334006 for gravel pit as place of occurrence. Using a general parent would lose specificity; selecting siblings like 'quarry' or 'mine' would misclassify. The phrase remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
309105004,Bone biopsy specimen (specimen),Specimen name: bone biopsy,"As a specimen name, 'bone biopsy' indicates bone tissue collected by biopsy, with no added attributes like location or technique. The concept belongs to the Specimen hierarchy. Bone biopsy specimen (309105004) is the most precise code, as it represents bone plus biopsy. Broader parents lack this combined specificity, and choosing a technique-specific child would introduce detail not present. The wording is about the specimen, not the procedure."
44064002,Urginea burkei (organism),Documented organism: Urginea burkei,"This documents an organism and explicitly names it Urginea burkei, fitting the Organism category. The contextual term 'Documented organism' does not alter the target concept—it remains the species identity. It should not be coded to higher-level taxa or different species, since the exact species epithet burkei is present. Thus, SCTID 44064002 is the most precise code."
1204483005,Turks and Caicos Islands (geographic location),Map location: Turks and Caicos Islands,"‘Map location’ is context indicating a geographic reference; the value is the named territory. SNOMED CT category: Location. This corresponds to SCTID 1204483005. It does not imply a different parent region or a child locality, and it introduces no clinical attributes like timing or severity. The entry remains solely the place name."
304667005,Visual intelligence quotient (observable entity),Visual IQ value,"The term 'value' references the observable's output without stating a number, keeping focus on the variable itself. Category: Observable entity. It is specific to visual IQ rather than the generic IQ or other domains. 'Value' here denotes the same quotient construct and does not introduce interpretation or severity, so 304667005 is appropriate and more precise than parent or sibling concepts."
112471008,Dermacentor occidentalis (organism),Taxon recorded: Dermacentor occidentalis,"Recording the taxon as Dermacentor occidentalis points to the species-level organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The entry does not introduce attributes beyond the taxonomic name, so SCTID 112471008 is correct. Parent or sibling taxa would be less specific or incorrect given the wording."
470191003,"Laboratory scale, mechanical (physical object)",Mechanical lab weight-measuring scale,"The entry denotes a scale used in the laboratory for measuring weight and clearly specifies it as mechanical. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The phrasing is equivalent to 'Laboratory scale, mechanical' and does not add features like capacity, brand, or state. It is not the broader 'laboratory scale' parent due to the mechanical specification, and it avoids electronic/digital siblings."
16821004,"Metabolic requirement, function (observable entity)",Metabolic requirement function measured property,"‘Measured property’ indicates the nature of the observable but does not supply a value or interpretation, leaving it as the named observable entity. The category is Observable entity. The phrase avoids specifying subtypes like basal/resting or nutrient-specific requirements, so it should not map to rate/demand sub-concepts. SCTID 16821004 is the most precise match."
294467001,Allergy to framycetin (finding),Drug allergy: framycetin,"This phrasing indicates a drug allergy and names framycetin as the specific agent. The core finding is allergy to framycetin, making Allergy to framycetin (finding), SCTID 294467001, the exact match within the Clinical finding hierarchy. Mapping to a parent such as Drug allergy would be less specific, and sibling concepts like Allergy to aminoglycosides are inappropriate because only framycetin is specified. Including the label 'Drug allergy' does not introduce new attributes and remains semantically equivalent."
1229866004,American Joint Committee on Cancer pT4b (qualifier value),Staging field update: TNM AJCC pT4b,"This indicates an update of the staging field to TNM AJCC pT4b, clarifying the pathologic T substage. The concept is an AJCC Qualifier value. The inclusion of 'pT4b' is specific and rules out the parent pT4 or siblings pT4a and cT4b. 'TNM AJCC' is a conventional synonym that does not introduce extra attributes or alter the code selection."
64257004,D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (substance),Requested substance — D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase,"This entry requests the named substance but does not alter its identity; it still denotes the enzyme D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. No attributes like dosage, administration, or origin are added. Parent terms are too broad, and sibling/child variants would require extra qualifiers not present here. SCTID 64257004 is the correct, specific code."
266985007,In higher education (finding),Enrolled in college,"This states current enrollment in a college, indicating participation in higher education, without specifying level, program, or completion. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 266985007 aligns exactly, as college enrollment corresponds to being in higher education. Parent concepts like “Educational status” are too broad, while siblings such as “Not in education” or “In secondary education” are inconsistent with the wording. “Enrolled in college” is an acceptable synonym conveying the same higher education status."
430318008,Cytologic material obtained from urine (specimen),Cytologic material obtained from urine (specimen),"This is a near-exact restatement of the preferred term, clearly identifying the specimen class and source, and maps directly to SNOMED CT 430318008 (Specimen). It excludes broader parents by specifying cytology and avoids any collection or subtype detail that would trigger children. The phrasing is not procedural, solidifying its placement as the precise specimen concept."
397129002,Specimen from vulva (specimen),Specimen obtained at vulva,"This indicates that a specimen was obtained at the vulva and does not add method, type, or laterality. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It precisely maps to 397129002. More specific children like biopsy or swab specimens are not mentioned, and broader parent site categories fail to capture the specific vulvar origin."
317949002,Structure of thoracolumbar fascia (body structure),Thoracolumbar fascia,"The entry names the thoracolumbar fascia, which is an anatomical body structure in the posterior trunk spanning thoracic to lumbar regions. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure (Anatomical structure). This wording precisely matches SCTID 317949002: Structure of thoracolumbar fascia. It does not specify layers (anterior/posterior), sides, pathology, or function, so child concepts like specific layers of the thoracolumbar fascia would be too narrow. Broader parent concepts such as fascia of trunk or fascia (body structure) are too general. No additional attributes are introduced, making this the most accurate code selection."
248110007,Sexual assault (event),Discharge diagnosis: sexual assault,"This indicates sexual assault as the discharge diagnosis, but the underlying concept is still the occurrence of the sexual assault event. There are no additional attributes like timing, certainty, or type that would change the axis. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is Sexual assault (event) [248110007], category Event. Broader Assault (event) would be less precise, while Rape (event) or Sexual abuse (finding) add details or axes not supported by the wording. Thus, the event concept remains the precise mapping."
289944007,Milligram/millimole (qualifier value),milligrams per millimole,"The pluralized form still denotes the same unit ratio of mass to amount-of-substance. No analyte, context, or numeric value is given; only the unit is specified. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Qualifier value Milligram/millimole (289944007). Parent concepts such as Unit of measure are too general, and sibling units (mg/mol, mg/L, g/mmol) represent different measurement scales and would be inaccurate. Pluralization does not change the underlying unit, so it is semantically equivalent."
786044002,History of total arthroplasty of right shoulder (situation),Orthopedic history includes right total shoulder arthroplasty,"The line places a right total shoulder arthroplasty within the patient’s orthopedic history, specifying a completed total replacement on the right side. This is a Situation concept. SCTID 786044002 fits exactly, capturing history of total arthroplasty of the right shoulder. A parent concept that omits laterality or total specification would be less precise, and siblings like left-side or partial arthroplasty history do not match. The phrasing introduces no additional attributes such as indications or complications."
768747000,Product containing lanthanum and/or lanthanum compound (product),On lanthanum product,"A concise problem-list style entry indicating the patient is using a product that contains lanthanum or a lanthanum compound aligns with the Product concept 768747000. It remains general and does not specify dose form or particular compound, avoiding child concept mappings while being more specific than broader parent categories."
31370004,Dopamine-beta-monooxygenase (substance),DBH enzyme,"The entry uses the accepted abbreviation DBH and clarifies it as an enzyme, pointing to dopamine-beta-monooxygenase without introducing additional attributes. This is a Substance concept and aligns with SNOMED CT code 31370004. It does not imply measurement, pathology, or related compounds, so parent generic enzyme concepts are too broad and disorder/test siblings are inappropriate."
63997002,"Skilled nursing facility, level 3 care (environment)",SNF — level 3 care,"This entry uses the standard abbreviation SNF for skilled nursing facility and clearly states level 3 care, which is synonymous with the fully spelled-out concept. Category: Environment. The presence of ‘level 3’ narrows the setting to SCTID 63997002 rather than the parent SNF concept without level specification or any other level variants. The abbreviation does not change the meaning, and no additional attributes are added."
1366178002,Insertion of external drain into subdural space of spinal cord (procedure),Discharge summary: underwent insertion of external drain into the spinal cord subdural space,"This discharge summary statement documents that the patient underwent insertion of an external drain into the spinal cord subdural space, directly mapping to SCTID 1366178002. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The specificity of site and external device differentiates it from broader parents and excludes siblings such as cranial subdural drain insertion or epidural/subarachnoid placements. The wording does not add cause or timing beyond confirming the procedure occurred."
313977007,Serum lamotrigine measurement (procedure),Serum lamotrigine concentration measurement performed,"The phrase indicates that a measurement of lamotrigine concentration in serum has been performed, emphasizing the procedural act. This is a Procedure, precisely matching Serum lamotrigine measurement (313977007). The inclusion of “performed” denotes completion but does not shift the concept away from the measurement procedure. Alternatives such as requests or findings would be less suitable given the explicit completed procedural context in serum."
736374003,Gynecology unplanned inpatient care plan (record artifact),Gynecology unplanned admission care plan,"The phrase 'admission' here is synonymous with inpatient care and retains the unplanned qualifier within the gynecology specialty; it refers to the care plan record. This is a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. The best match is Gynecology unplanned inpatient care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736374003. Parent concepts without gynecology are too general, and siblings for planned admissions or non-inpatient settings are inappropriate. The use of 'admission' as a synonym for inpatient does not introduce new attributes or change the concept."
51377009,Structure of epicondylar part of femur (body structure),Epicondylar anatomy of the femur,"This phrase describes the epicondylar anatomy of the femur, i.e., the epicondylar part. It remains within the Body structure domain and aligns with SCTID 51377009. No additional attributes (side, condition, timing) are present. Parent concepts covering the whole femur are too broad, while child concepts like medial or lateral epicondyle would be more specific than stated. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent."
223818006,Wicklow (geographic location),Referral sent to Wicklow.,"The referral destination is the geographic place “Wicklow.” The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). Destination context does not change the underlying location value; the correct code is 223818006. The entry does not specify subtypes (county/town), so narrower concepts would be inappropriate; a parent concept would be too broad."
72303005,Structure of petrous portion of internal carotid artery (body structure),Anatomy reference term: ICA—petrous portion,"The anatomy reference term names the internal carotid artery and specifies the petrous portion, introducing no additional characteristics. This is a Body structure mention. SNOMED CT 72303005 precisely represents the petrous portion of the ICA. Parent concepts for the entire ICA are too general, and sibling segments (cervical, lacerum, cavernous) would miscode the location. The dash is stylistic and does not alter the semantic equivalence."
216369008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, mountain resort (environment)",Accident took place at a mountain resort,"The statement expresses that the accident’s place of occurrence was a mountain resort, introducing no additional attributes beyond the location. It fits SNOMED CT’s Environment concept for “Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, mountain resort” (216369008). Choosing a parent concept would be less specific; selecting sibling concepts (e.g., ski slope, hotel, street) would be inaccurate because only a mountain resort is named."
309979005,Endocrine surgery department (environment),Endocrine Surgery Dept.,"The abbreviation 'Dept.' is a standard shorthand for 'department' and does not alter meaning. The entry denotes the environment of the endocrine surgery department, aligning with the Environment hierarchy. SCTID 309979005 is the most specific code. Parent concepts (e.g., Department [environment]) are less precise, and sibling departments (e.g., Endocrinology, General surgery) are not referenced. No modifiers such as ward or clinic are present, so child concepts do not apply."
434541009,Propionispora vibrioides (organism),Taxon: Propionispora vibrioides,"The entry identifies the organism at the taxonomic level of species, Propionispora vibrioides, and includes no clinical attributes. The main concept is the organism; the SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 434541009 is the exact species code. Parent concepts like the genus Propionispora or broader bacterial groupings lack this granularity, and no sibling species are mentioned. There is no strain-level detail (child concepts), nor any indication of detection, infection, site, or severity. The term 'taxon' is a neutral taxonomic descriptor and therefore a clinically equivalent way of referring to the organism, preserving the same code selection."
735138005,Statement of adequacy of specimen (record artifact),Specimen adequacy: statement included,"The entry indicates the inclusion of a statement about specimen adequacy within a record, aligning with a record artifact that captures this reporting element. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It matches 735138005 because it denotes the presence of the adequacy statement without specifying adequacy status or specimen type. Concepts like 'Specimen adequacy finding' would imply a clinical finding, which is not stated, and children indicating a specific adequacy assessment are not suitable due to the absence of outcome language. The wording is equivalent to the presence of the statement."
444311000124100,Modular hydrolyzed protein infant formula component (product),Infant formula component: modular protein hydrolysate,"The phrase specifies a Product in the context of infant formula: a modular component that is a protein hydrolysate (synonym for hydrolyzed protein). It does not introduce details like partial/extensive hydrolysis, source, or clinical indication. Parent categories omitting hydrolyzed protein are too broad; siblings tied to other nutrient modules or to complete formulas are incorrect. Child concepts with added specificity are not supported by this general wording."
5471000179106,Non-centralized emergency service record (record artifact),Emergency service record (non-centralized),"The entry specifies an emergency service record and qualifies it as non-centralized. As a Record artifact, the correct concept is Non-centralized emergency service record (5471000179106). The placement of the qualifier in parentheses does not change meaning; it prevents mapping to the parent Emergency service record and excludes the sibling Centralized emergency service record."
1156611002,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of anus at proximal surgical margin in anal resection specimen (observable entity),Proximal margin presence of primary anal malignancy (resection specimen),"This label indicates the observable variable measuring presence of primary malignant neoplasm of the anus at the proximal surgical margin in a resection specimen derived from anal surgery. The essential attributes—primary status, anal site, proximal margin, and resection specimen—are all present. As an Observable entity, it exactly fits SCTID 1156611002, which encodes this presence parameter rather than any outcome. Parent concepts like generic 'presence of malignancy at margin' would be less specific; sibling concepts for distal or CRM margins would not apply. 'Primary anal malignancy' is clinically equivalent to 'primary malignant neoplasm of anus.'"
705219006,Microtome (physical object),Microtome (histology bench),"Mentioning its location at a histology bench provides context without altering the object identity, which remains a microtome. In SNOMED CT, this is a Physical object, correctly coded as 705219006. Broader concepts like laboratory furniture or equipment are less specific, and no use/action is described. The absence of subtype or component details avoids child/sibling misclassification. The parenthetical context does not modify the core device concept."
368516001,Entire carpal palmar branch of radial artery (body structure),Entire palmar carpal branch of radial artery,"The wording explicitly matches the SNOMED 'Entire' modeling for the palmar carpal branch of the radial artery, designating the whole structure. Category: Body structure. It is neither the broader parent 'radial artery' nor any different branch (e.g., dorsal carpal, superficial palmar). No extra attributes are present, so SCTID 368516001 is exact."
1365827000,Photographic intraoral direct right lateral view image in centric relation displaying overjet (record artifact),Direct intraoral right lateral image captured in centric relation; overjet is displayed.,"The entry indicates a direct intraoral image from the right lateral view captured in centric relation, with overjet displayed. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 1365827000 is the precise code; using a parent concept (e.g., unspecified lateral) or sibling (left lateral, mirror view, non-CR) would be less accurate. The interchangeable terms here do not add clinical findings or procedural details beyond the stored image."
712829007,Patient request for smoking cessation information (procedure),Radiology intake: patient requested smoking cessation information,"Though documented in radiology intake, the key is the patient's request for smoking cessation information. This qualifies as a Procedure. SCTID 712829007 is the exact match. Parent concepts like general information request are too broad, and child/sibling concepts that imply provision of counseling or materials would misrepresent the entry."
702901004,Pediatric dermatology clinic (environment),Children’s dermatology clinic,"The phrase denotes a clinic environment providing dermatology services to children. It is an Environment concept. 'Children’s' is a plain-language equivalent of 'pediatric,' making this a clinically safe synonym for Pediatric dermatology clinic (environment) [702901004]. Mapping to the parent Dermatology clinic would omit the pediatric constraint, while mapping to Pediatric clinic would omit the dermatology specialty; therefore, the pediatric dermatology clinic code is the exact match."
388030008,Apium graveolens specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Analyte: Apium graveolens IgE,"As a lab report analyte label, this denotes the immunoglobulin E specific to Apium graveolens and refers to the substance being measured, not a test procedure or result. It cleanly targets SNOMED CT 388030008. A concept for the assay or an observable would be less appropriate because this phrasing focuses on the analyte itself. Broader IgE substances or other allergen-specific IgEs would be incorrect. The synonym is fully equivalent and does not add attributes."
224821000,Pedestrian road crossing controlled by lights (environment),Patient described a light-controlled pedestrian crossing,"This patient-reported statement names a pedestrian crossing controlled by lights, which corresponds exactly to the environment concept. Category: Environment. The wording does not introduce an event or other qualifiers; it excludes broader or alternate crossing types. 'Light-controlled' is equivalent to 'controlled by lights' and supports precise coding to the given concept."
467003009,Weighted cuff (physical object),Equipment: weighted cuff,"The entry registers the object under equipment and specifies it as a weighted cuff. Category: Physical object. The equipment context adds no specific attributes and keeps the concept focused on the weighted cuff device. Parent 'Physical object' would be less specific, and child/sibling distinctions (e.g., specific site weights or non-weight cuffs) are not indicated."
116937005,"Antibody to Salmonella Typhi group D, H (substance)",Anti-Salmonella Typhi H (group D) immune globulin,"Using 'immune globulin' as a synonym for antibody, with explicit H antigen and group D, matches the substance concept 'Antibody to Salmonella Typhi group D, H' (116937005). Category: Substance. No added attributes (e.g., therapeutic use, isotype) are included. Broader or different target antigen concepts would misrepresent the specificity."
395172009,No evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (situation),Follow-up assessment: no evidence of LV systolic dysfunction.,"This entry documents a follow-up assessment concluding there is no evidence of LV systolic dysfunction. That is a situation-level negation and belongs in the SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context category, SCTID 395172009. Using a disorder code for dysfunction would be inappropriate, and choosing a normal-function finding would not reflect the absence framing. The follow-up context does not add clinical attributes altering the mapping; the key is the specified negation of LV systolic dysfunction."
288559001,Ecological environment (environment),Ecological surroundings,"“Surroundings” in clinical documentation is a permissible synonym for environment when paired with “ecological,” keeping the meaning aligned with ecological environment. The concept falls under SNOMED CT’s Environment or geographical location hierarchy. Broader parents are too general, and narrower subtypes (natural, built, specific locale) are not stated. No additional attributes (e.g., exposure, hazard, timeframe) are implied, so Ecological environment is the accurate match."
737068000,Repair of ventral hernia using prosthesis (procedure),Ventral abdominal wall hernia repair with mesh,"‘Ventral abdominal wall hernia’ denotes the ventral hernia site, and ‘with mesh’ indicates prosthesis. Main concept: ventral hernia repair employing prosthesis. Category: Procedure. This maps precisely to SCTID 737068000; it is not generic repair (parent) because the mesh is specified, and it avoids child specificity such as incisional or umbilical variants, approach, or device subtype."
223780000,Tasmania (geographic location),Region: Tasmania,"The wording identifies Tasmania as a geographic region. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). This maps directly to SCTID 223780000 because it names the specific region without qualifying details. A parent concept (Australia) would be broader than intended, and a child concept (e.g., Hobart) would be narrower. ‘Region’ functions as a descriptive synonym for a geographic place and does not alter code selection."
218160009,Burning due to contact with molten bitumen or tar (event),Burning attributable to contact with molten asphalt,"The statement attributes burning to contact with molten asphalt, explicitly identifying the agent and exposure type. This matches the SNOMED CT Event Burning due to contact with molten bitumen or tar (event), SCTID 218160009. It avoids injury specifics and thus is an event rather than a disorder. Parent concepts lacking agent specificity and siblings involving other substance exposures are less precise. “Asphalt” is a synonym for bitumen/tar and preserves the intended coding."
117059000,Trenbolone (substance),Parent compound listed: trenbolone,"Calling it the 'parent compound' emphasizes the base substance trenbolone and distinguishes it from ester derivatives, without naming any specific ester. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; the precise match is Trenbolone (substance) SCTID 117059000. Child concepts like trenbolone acetate/enanthate would be narrower and not indicated; broader classes would be too general."
1287933004,Intermediate care hospital for intellectual disability (environment),Site of care: intermediate care hospital for intellectual disability,"The entry identifies the site of care as an intermediate care hospital for intellectual disability, directly mapping to the Environment concept SCTID 1287933004. The context label 'Site of care' does not alter the environmental concept being coded. Broader or sibling concepts would omit either the intermediate care level or the intellectual disability focus, making them less precise. No added attributes are present."
396807009,"Specimen from pancreas obtained by pancreaticoduodenectomy, total pancreatectomy (specimen)","Pancreas specimen—pancreatoduodenectomy, total pancreatectomy",The entry identifies a pancreas-derived specimen obtained via pancreatoduodenectomy (spelling variant of pancreaticoduodenectomy) with total pancreatectomy. This is a Specimen concept. “Pancreatoduodenectomy” is a clinically accepted synonym for “pancreaticoduodenectomy” and does not alter the meaning. The inclusion of total pancreatectomy prevents mapping to broader or sibling procedure-derived specimens.
465857000,Rigid endoscope telescope (physical object),Rigid endoscope telescope (inventory),"The parenthetical inventory context does not alter the device identity; it still denotes a rigid endoscope telescope. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). SCTID 465857000 remains the best match because the essential attributes are the telescope and its rigidity. Parent terms lacking rigidity or flexible siblings are less appropriate, and no child attributes such as angle or caliber are specified."
789131009,Close up photographic view of teeth with no set magnification or distance (record artifact),"Teeth close-up photograph, magnification and distance not standardized","This captures the same artifact: a close-up photo of teeth with magnification and distance not standardized, which is equivalent to ‘no set magnification or distance.’ The category is Record artifact. A parent like ‘photograph of teeth’ would be less specific, and a sibling such as a standardized macro shot would be incorrect because the entry negates standardization. No extra attributes (e.g., orientation, laterality, pathology) are introduced, making the given concept the most precise match."
712635009,Noninvasive hemodynamic monitor (physical object),Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring apparatus,"The entry refers to an apparatus designed for noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring, a tangible physical device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 712635009 is the best fit, representing the noninvasive hemodynamic monitor. A parent concept would be overly general without the noninvasive attribute, and siblings like invasive monitors or specific-parameter devices would not match the described capability. “Apparatus” is a synonym for device and does not change the clinical meaning."
311801003,Head and neck approaches (qualifier value),Procedure will use a head and neck approach,"The statement describes the approach for a procedure as head and neck, without adding technical attributes or discrete sub-approaches. This is best coded as the Qualifier value Head and neck approaches (311801003). The general parent ""Approach"" lacks the regional specificity, and children such as ""Transcervical approach"" or ""Transfacial approach"" are not stated. The phrasing is a narrative synonym that remains clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
709675007,Cellulomonas pakistanensis (organism),Cellulomonas pakistanensis — species designation,"The wording indicates the formal species designation and does not add clinical or locational context. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It maps cleanly to SCTID 709675007, avoiding broader taxonomic parents or different species siblings. No strain or subspecies is specified, ensuring the species-level concept is the correct choice."
282511007,Entire splenic arterioles (body structure),ROI: splenic arterioles,"Using 'ROI' (region of interest) with 'splenic arterioles' refers to the anatomical set of arterioles in the spleen without adding clinical attributes, mapping to 'Entire splenic arterioles'. Category is Body structure. It does not suggest a subset or a different vessel type. Parents are under-specified, and siblings or children (e.g., venules, capillaries, penicillar arterioles) are not indicated. The phrasing is a contextual label and remains anatomically precise."
250817000,Mandatory tidal volume (observable entity),Mandatory tidal volume reading,"Referring to a 'reading' indicates an observed value without specifying numbers, while 'mandatory tidal volume' identifies the exact observable. The category is Observable entity. This is a clinically equivalent phrasing to the preferred term, supporting SCTID 250817000. It is distinct from general tidal volume and does not suggest siblings such as spontaneous or set tidal volume, as no such qualifiers are present."
1220629002,Impaired response to stem cell mobilization procedure (finding),Clinician assessment: impaired response to stem cell mobilization,"The clinician’s assessment documents impaired response to the mobilization procedure, directly reflecting the concept. It is a Clinical finding without extra attributes such as regimen, cause, or severity. It stops short of declaring failure, and is more specific than general findings. Thus, SCTID 1220629002 is the most precise coding choice."
713843006,Non-sterile hybrid coated esophageal stent (physical object),For use: non-sterile hybrid-coated esophageal stent,This denotes a device prepared for use: an esophageal stent that is hybrid-coated and non-sterile. The preparation context does not introduce additional attributes. It is a Physical object and maps precisely to SNOMED CT 713843006. Parent concepts or sterile siblings would be less appropriate because they either omit hybrid coating/non-sterile details or contradict them.
1331000119107,History of bilateral breast implants (situation),Bilateral breast implants on past medical/surgical history.,"The entry explicitly locates the implants within past medical/surgical history and confirms bilateral laterality, fitting the Situation category. The most precise SNOMED match is 'History of bilateral breast implants' (SCTID 1331000119107). A general 'history of breast implants' without laterality is less specific, and any present-finding or procedural concept would not match the historical context. The wording introduces no extraneous attributes."
115923008,Blood group antigen Street (substance),Street (blood group antigen),"This entry is a parenthetical designation of Street as a blood group antigen, directly pointing to the antigen substance. It falls under the SNOMED CT Substance hierarchy and matches SCTID 115923008. No additional attributes or results are stated, ensuring it does not map to parent generic antigen concepts or sibling antigens. The format is a clinically safe synonym of the preferred term."
736379008,Miscarriage care plan (record artifact),Miscarriage plan of care,"The phrase indicates a plan-of-care document tied to miscarriage management and follow-up. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This aligns precisely with Miscarriage care plan (record artifact) SCTID 736379008, not with the disorder or event of miscarriage itself. A more generic plan-of-care concept would be insufficiently specific, and siblings addressing other reproductive or obstetric conditions would not match the wording. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and introduces no new attributes."
438336007,Hemorrhoid tissue specimen (specimen),Hemorrhoidal tissue specimen,"This describes a specimen of tissue from a hemorrhoid using the adjective 'hemorrhoidal,' which is a clinically equivalent synonym for hemorrhoid. There are no added attributes like procedure type or location subtype. The correct SNOMED CT category is Specimen, mapped to Hemorrhoid tissue specimen (438336007). Broader parent categories are less specific, while child or sibling concepts that introduce biopsy, excision, or internal vs. external hemorrhoid would be inappropriate because such details are not stated."
744980002,Medical critical care plan (record artifact),Critical care plan (medical),"This phrasing denotes a plan-of-care artifact for critical care and clarifies the medical discipline. The category is Record artifact. Medical critical care plan (record artifact) SCTID 744980002 is the precise match because it combines the critical care context with the medical domain. A general Critical care plan would be underspecified, and Nursing critical care plan would be the wrong discipline. The parent concept Care plan lacks the critical care constraint, so it is less appropriate. The parenthetical 'medical' preserves the exact scope and does not introduce new attributes."
442887009,Percutaneous needle biopsy of pancreas using ultrasound guidance (procedure),Discharge summary: completed ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of pancreas,"This discharge note indicates the completed Procedure: a percutaneous needle biopsy of the pancreas with ultrasound guidance. The body site, method, approach, and guidance elements are all explicit, aligning with the target concept. More generic parent concepts would omit these specifics. Sibling concepts (CT-guided, EUS-guided) are not compatible with the phrasing. The entry does not introduce subtype attributes like FNA vs core, preserving the precise mapping to 442887009."
223916009,Sheppey (geographic location),Toponym: Sheppey,"The term 'Toponym' indicates a place name, with Sheppey as the named geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and the specific code is Sheppey (geographic location), SCTID 223916009. No relationships or broader/narrower regions are introduced, so coding to Sheppey is precise, and parent/child concepts would misrepresent the entry."
785906002,Scalpel bougie cricothyroidotomy (procedure),Performed scalpel bougie cricothyroidotomy,"This statement documents that the scalpel bougie cricothyroidotomy was performed, which is the procedure itself. It belongs to the Procedure category and maps to SCTID 785906002. The wording does not add timing or outcomes, and it excludes parent generic cricothyroidotomy and sibling techniques like needle cricothyroidotomy."
1365791000,Photographic extraoral image of face showing any anomalies (record artifact),Extraoral facial photo showing anomalies,"The phrase indicates a photo of the face taken extraorally and notes that anomalies are shown. This is a Record artifact, not a clinical finding, because it characterizes a recorded image. It aligns with SCTID 1365791000 through its elements: photographic modality, extraoral perspective, face region, and the general ‘showing anomalies’ qualifier. Mapping to a parent artifact without the anomalies descriptor would be less precise, and mapping to any child/sibling naming specific abnormalities would be too narrow. The shortened ‘photo’ is a clinically safe synonym for ‘photographic image’ and does not change the concept."
245961000,T11/T12 part of supraspinous ligament (body structure),Level T11-T12 supraspinous ligament portion,"This entry specifies the supraspinous ligament portion at vertebral level T11-T12. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It aligns exactly with SCTID 245961000, not implying the entire ligament or other regions. Parent terms are insufficiently specific, while sibling or child structures like interspinous ligament or single-level portions would be mismatches. The term “portion” is equivalent and does not change code selection."
12591000132100,Severe acute respiratory syndrome suspected (situation),Lab order note: test ordered because SARS is suspected,"This lab order note states that testing is prompted by suspected SARS, retaining uncertainty and evaluation. Main concept: SARS; attribute: suspected. Category: Situation. The most accurate mapping is “Severe acute respiratory syndrome suspected (situation).” The confirmed disorder code would misrepresent the clinical status, while generic suspected disease codes are insufficiently specific. The wording is equivalent to “SARS suspected” without introducing cause, timing, or severity."
723236006,Minimum blood pressure (observable entity),Trough BP,"‘Trough BP’ is a concise phrasing for the minimum blood pressure value, using ‘trough’ as a clinical synonym for minimum and ‘BP’ for blood pressure. It maps to SNOMED CT 723236006, Minimum blood pressure (observable entity). The phrase does not introduce component specifics, timing, or numeric data, avoiding misalignment with child or sibling concepts. It is not a clinical finding like hypotension, so the observable entity representing minimum BP is the precise match."
242594004,Fish sting (event),Noted fish sting,"This concise documentation phrase notes that a fish sting occurred, without any added clinical attributes such as severity, timing, or body location. The concept falls under Event. Fish sting (event) [242594004] is the best match because it represents the occurrence. Broader parent concepts (e.g., marine animal sting) would be less specific, and more specific child concepts (e.g., stingray sting) are not indicated. It does not denote a clinical finding or diagnosis, so injury/envenomation codes are inappropriate. The synonymical phrasing maintains equivalence to the event concept."
3050003,Non-permeable (qualifier value),Permeability: non-permeable,"This entry presents a property label ('Permeability') and the value 'non‑permeable'. The coded concept is the value, which is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT, matching SCTID 3050003. Using the property header does not add clinical attributes beyond naming the characteristic. Sibling values ('permeable', 'semi‑permeable') would not fit; parent concepts describing permeability without a value would be too general. Thus, 'Non‑permeable (qualifier value)' is the precise match."
773591003,Podiatry care plan (record artifact),Pre-op note includes the podiatry care plan,"This wording shows inclusion of the podiatry care plan in a preoperative note, but the core concept is the care plan artifact itself. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 773591003 is the precise code due to the podiatry specialty designation. The pre-op context does not introduce procedural attributes to the plan; thus, mapping to parent generic plans or sibling specialty plans would be less accurate."
384736003,Nuclear grade finding (finding),Nuclear grade documented,"This entry conveys that a nuclear grade has been documented as a finding, without specifying what that grade is or tying it to a particular grading system or diagnosis, fitting Nuclear grade finding (clinical finding), SCTID 384736003. The attribute here is documentation context, which does not change the clinical concept or add dimensions like severity or site. Using “documented” does not convert it into a procedure; it merely indicates the presence of the finding in records. Parent concepts like histologic grade are broader than nuclear grade, and child concepts such as high or low nuclear grade are not indicated. Thus, the general nuclear grade finding code is the most precise match."
3338002,Open reduction of open radial shaft fracture (procedure),Procedure: Open reduction of open fracture of radius diaphysis,"This operative phrasing identifies an open reduction (open surgical approach to reduce a fracture) performed on an open fracture involving the radius diaphysis (shaft). The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the most accurate code is “Open reduction of open radial shaft fracture” (3338002). More general parents (e.g., open reduction of open fracture of the radius) do not specify the shaft, and ORIF-related children add fixation not stated. Using “diaphysis” as a synonym for “shaft” is clinically equivalent and does not alter the intended code."
36322006,Acetylindoxyl oxidase (substance),Acetyl indoxyl oxidase,"This entry presents a spacing variation of the same substance, “Acetyl indoxyl oxidase,” which is a clinically equivalent synonym for Acetylindoxyl oxidase and maps to SCTID 36322006. The main concept is the named substance; there are no attributes such as use, dosage, route, or reaction. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The specific name supports selection of the precise concept rather than parent categories (e.g., Oxidase or Enzyme) or sibling enzymes. The spacing does not introduce any new semantic attribute; it remains the identical substance and does not imply a product or role."
66237001,Structure of ventral branch of spinal nerve of cauda equina (body structure),Ventral ramus of spinal nerve of cauda equina,"This entry denotes the same anatomy using the clinically standard synonym “ramus” for “branch.” The concept is the ventral ramus of a cauda equina spinal nerve, a Body structure. SNOMED CT 66237001 specifically covers the ventral branch/ramus within the cauda equina. Using the general “spinal nerve of cauda equina” would be too broad (parent), and “dorsal ramus” would be a sibling not indicated. “Ventral root” is a different structure (root vs ramus). The synonym does not change attributes or granularity, so 66237001 is appropriate."
24946003,Structure of longitudinal fasciculus of pons (body structure),Anatomic structure: longitudinal fasciculus of pons,"This documentation-style phrase points to the specific anatomical structure—the longitudinal fasciculus in the pons—placing it firmly in the Body structure domain. The absence of qualifiers keeps it distinct from specific sub-tracts (medial/dorsal) and more specific than general pontine structures, making the SNOMED concept for longitudinal fasciculus of pons the optimal match."
465661008,Auditory evoked-potential graphic recorder (physical object),Auditory EP graphic trace recorder,"“Auditory EP” is a synonym for auditory evoked potential, and “graphic trace recorder” conveys the device’s role in producing graphical tracings. The main concept is the specialized recorder for auditory evoked potentials with graphic output. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). This selection fits SCTID 465661008 precisely. A general EP recorder without the graphic component or without the auditory modality would be less precise, and related devices like stimulators or amplifiers are different objects entirely."
218191003,Overexposure to radiofrequency radiation (event),Documented RF radiation overexposure,"“Documented” provides context of recordkeeping without altering the clinical concept, which remains overexposure to radiofrequency radiation. This aligns with Overexposure to radiofrequency radiation (event), SCTID 218191003, and sits in the Event category. The inclusion of “RF radiation” ensures the radiation type is the radiofrequency spectrum. The term does not add attributes like severity or cause; it simply indicates that the event was noted. Parent concepts without the overexposure qualifier are less specific, and sibling concepts referring to different radiation forms are not appropriate. The abbreviation RF is clinically equivalent to radiofrequency and does not affect coding."
223355002,Anegada (geographic location),Physical location name: Anegada,"The phrase identifies Anegada as a physical geographic location, which matches SNOMED CT 223355002. Category: Location. No additional attributes such as country, timeframe, or relationships are present. Therefore, a broader parent concept would be less precise, and no alternative place is implied, confirming Anegada as the exact match."
738555002,Cochlear implant system external magnet (physical object),Cochlear implant headpiece external magnet,"This indicates the external magnet located in the CI headpiece, still referring to the same external magnet of the cochlear implant system. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 738555002 best fits; a code for the entire headpiece or processor would be too broad, and internal magnet concepts are excluded by “external.” “Headpiece” here clarifies the common location of the CI external magnet without changing the coded object."
445673000,Original report (record artifact),Document identified as the original report.,"The statement identifies the document artifact as an original report. Main concept: original report document. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Code 445673000 matches because the core meaning is originality of the report artifact; this does not introduce type (e.g., radiology) or status (final/prelim). Parents are less specific; sibling codes for copies or revisions would be incorrect."
73812006,Tenotomy of stapedius (procedure),Stapedial tendon tenotomy,"The terms 'stapedial tendon' and 'stapedius tendon' are clinically equivalent, referring to the tendon of the stapedius muscle. This entry denotes a Procedure of cutting that tendon, mapping exactly to SCTID 73812006. No technique or indication is specified, avoiding child or related concepts. Parents like general middle ear surgery are overly broad, and siblings such as tensor tympani tenotomy target a different tendon. Thus, 73812006 is the precise match."
9588001,Beta-phosphoglucomutase (substance),Document references beta-phosphoglucomutase,"The sentence context indicates a document mention, but the medical concept present is solely the substance beta-phosphoglucomutase without any attributes like concentration, activity, or diagnostic assessment. This belongs to the SNOMED CT Substance category and maps to SCTID 9588001. Broader or different codes (e.g., phosphoglucomutase in general or findings about presence/levels) are not suggested by the wording. The surrounding words are contextual and do not change the identity or specificity of the substance named."
162001003,No cardiovascular symptom (situation),No symptoms referable to the cardiovascular system.,"This wording states that there are no symptoms attributable to the cardiovascular system, maintaining a negative symptom context. The category is 'Situation with explicit context.' SCTID 162001003 is the most precise match. A general 'no symptoms' concept would be too broad, and specific symptom absences (e.g., angina absent) are not mentioned, making child/sibling concepts less appropriate."
434163008,Pillotina calotermitidis (organism),Pillotina calotermitidis species,"The wording identifies the species-level taxonomic unit, Pillotina calotermitidis, with no implications of presence or pathology. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This aligns exactly with the species concept SCTID 434163008. A parent like Pillotina (organism) would be too general, and any other Pillotina species would be siblings and therefore incorrect. The term 'species' is a taxonomic qualifier and does not introduce new attributes."
242268009,Accidental exposure to paint (event),Follow-up note: accidental exposure to paint,"This follow-up documentation references accidental exposure to paint without specifying route, timing, or effects. The concept is an Event and should be coded as Accidental exposure to paint (event), SCTID 242268009. Concepts implying occupational or intentional exposure, or those that include a specific mechanism (e.g., ingestion/inhalation) or site are not supported by the wording."
217272009,Accident due to fall from burning apartment (event),Accidental fall from an apartment that was on fire,"This states an unintentional fall from an apartment on fire, which is semantically equivalent to ‘Accident due to fall from burning apartment’ (SCTID 217272009) under Event. The attributes include accident, fall, and apartment on fire (synonymous with burning apartment). Parents lacking the burning apartment detail are too general; siblings pointing to other structures or generic burning buildings would be inaccurate. The synonym ‘apartment that was on fire’ does not change the concept or the code."
46692005,Spigelia marilandica (organism),Species identified: Spigelia marilandica,"This statement documents identification of a species and names Spigelia marilandica explicitly. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The phrasing adds only an identification context, not a clinical attribute or preparation, and does not alter the taxonomic target. It is more specific than the genus or plant family, and does not suggest a cultivar or plant part. Hence, the correct match is the Spigelia marilandica (organism) concept, SCTID 46692005."
1184587005,Plan of care document section (record artifact),Plan of care section in progress note,"This specifies the plan-of-care section embedded within a progress note. The category is Record artifact. Plan of care document section (1184587005) is the correct code because the entry identifies a section, not the plan content as a separate artifact or a treatment procedure. Generic parent sections are too broad, and other named sections in progress notes (e.g., subjective, assessment) are siblings and do not fit. The context of a progress note does not change the concept."
257670006,Private house (environment),Residence type: private house,"This entry specifies a residence type, namely a private house, focusing on the environmental classification of the dwelling. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It selects Private house (environment) [257670006] because the term points to a privately situated house rather than a general home setting or other residential forms. Parent concepts like Home (environment) are too generic, and siblings like Apartment (environment) or Private residence (environment) would be inaccurate because they are either different dwelling forms or broader categories. The phrase is a semantically equivalent way to indicate the same environment."
713377008,Tunneled catheter tip (physical object),Tip segment of the tunneled catheter,"The phrase describes the ‘tip segment’ of a catheter that is tunneled, maintaining focus on the terminal portion of the device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It is best coded to SCTID 713377008 because it specifies both the component (tip) and the tunneled characteristic, without introducing details about location or catheter subtype. A parent concept like “Catheter tip” would be less specific, and a sibling concept like “Tunneled catheter” refers to the whole device. Child concepts adding central venous or dialysis context are not indicated."
87183004,Structure of ligament of distal tibiofibular joint (body structure),Imaging focus: distal tibiofibular joint ligament,"The entry centers on the ligament of the distal tibiofibular joint as an anatomical focus, with no attribute like integrity or tear. It is a Body structure mapping best to 'Structure of ligament of distal tibiofibular joint' (87183004). Using 'Imaging focus' is just contextual and does not affect codability. Parent entries are too broad, and children naming distinct ligaments are inappropriate because no specific subgroup is identified."
392040003,Genus Tomopeas (organism),Genus-level identification: Tomopeas,"This wording denotes identification at the genus level and names Tomopeas. The main concept is the genus Tomopeas, category Organism; SCTID 392040003 aligns perfectly. Although 'identification' implies a labeling context, it does not add clinical attributes such as infection or exposure. The specification of genus precludes mapping to broader parents or narrower species children."
707693003,Corrected for total protein technique (qualifier value),Method uses total protein correction,"The entry indicates that the method employs 'total protein correction,' directly reflecting the qualifier value SCTID 707693003. It remains within the technique domain and avoids specifying analyte or outcomes. Category: Qualifier value. A parent concept would be too generic, and sibling corrections to other reference substances are not stated. The phrasing is a paraphrase of the same technique and maintains equivalence."
7221002,"Formation of tubed pedicle graft, head and neck (procedure)",Formation of tubed pedicle graft in the head & neck,"This variant uses the ampersand while preserving the meaning: forming a tubed pedicle graft in the head and neck. The concept is a Procedure; attributes: graft type and anatomical region. SCTID 7221002 fits precisely. Parent concepts not specifying site, or siblings indicating other areas or graft configurations, would be inappropriate. The punctuation change does not alter semantics or add attributes."
890291008,Light-cured polymer limb orthosis (physical object),Photopolymer limb orthotic brace,"This describes a limb orthotic brace made of photopolymer, which is equivalent to light-cured polymer. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The most precise match is Light-cured polymer limb orthosis (SCTID 890291008), capturing both the device type (limb orthosis) and the light-cured polymer material. Parent concepts without material detail are less specific, and children with limb subdivisions are not supported. Using 'brace' and 'orthotic' does not change the intended device or introduce extraneous attributes."
422735006,Summary clinical document (record artifact),Clinical summary document for chart,"This entry references a clinical summary document destined for or associated with the chart, emphasizing the artifact. It best matches SNOMED CT 422735006 Summary clinical document (record artifact). The SNOMED category is Record artifact. The phrasing does not imply discharge, referral, after-visit, or patient-summary specificity, avoiding more specific children or siblings. It is appropriately more detailed than the parent Record artifact by specifying the summary nature of the document."
217579004,Accident caused by cigar (event),Discharge summary: accident due to cigar,"Despite the documentation section reference, the core content is an accidental event caused by a cigar, with no added injury details. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is the Event “Accident caused by cigar (event)” SCTID 217579004. Parent and sibling concepts are excluded by the cigar specificity. There is no assertion of clinical outcomes, so disorder or burn codes would be incorrect."
246648006,Visual image size (observable entity),Size of visual image,"The phrase specifies the attribute being observed: the size of the visual image. This is an Observable entity rather than a finding or procedure. It does not imply normality, abnormality, interocular difference, or unit specifics such as visual angle or magnification, thereby mapping most precisely to the visual image size observable. A parent observable about vision generally would be insufficiently specific, and sibling measures such as visual angle or magnification represent different constructs, so they are less appropriate."
257483001,Chest lead (physical object),V lead (precordial),"Referring to a generic 'V lead' with 'precordial' clarifies that this is the chest-positioned lead type used in ECG, without specifying V1–V6. This best fits Chest lead (physical object) [257483001], categorized as a Physical object. It avoids over-specific children like 'Lead V1' or 'Lead V2' while distinguishing from limb leads (siblings). The terminology is consistent with standard ECG nomenclature and remains device-focused."
1187499006,Guadeloupe (geographic location),Patient from Guadeloupe,"This entry conveys origin, with the core concept being the geographic location Guadeloupe. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). Using “from” does not change the concept; it contextualizes the location as origin. It still maps to Guadeloupe (geographic location), SCTID 1187499006. Broader areas (e.g., France or Caribbean) and narrower sublocations are not stated, making the specific location concept the best fit."
448151007,Cost effective medication alternatives available (finding),Case review: cost-effective medication alternatives available,"The case review context does not alter the core finding that cost-effective medication alternatives are available, which fits SNOMED CT 448151007 and is categorized as a Clinical finding. There are no added specifics that would better map to child or sibling concepts, such as a particular alternative selected or formulary limitations. The statement focuses solely on availability and cost-effectiveness within medications, making this code the best match."
122630008,Specimen from esophagus obtained by esophageal resection (specimen),"Specimen—esophagus, resection","This short, problem-list style entry clearly denotes a specimen from the esophagus obtained by resection. The main medical concept is a specimen (Specimen category) with site (esophagus) and acquisition method (resection). SCTID 122630008 is the precise match as it encodes both. A parent concept omitting 'resection' would be less informative, and any sibling concepts specifying biopsy or partial/total procedures introduce details not present. The punctuation and shorthand reflect documentation style without changing the underlying concept."
271452006,Solicitors report (record artifact),Solicitor’s report available,"The main concept is a report written by a solicitor; 'available' describes accessibility but does not alter the artifact type or add clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT this is a Record artifact and maps to Solicitors report (record artifact) SCTID 271452006. A parent code like Report (record artifact) would be less specific without the solicitor author detail. Sibling artifacts (e.g., letters, police reports) are excluded by the explicit 'solicitor' and 'report' wording. The modifier 'available' is contextual and does not change the code selection."
465593005,Tonsil suturing needle (physical object),Operative note item: tonsil suturing needle,"This phrasing situates the device in operative documentation without altering its identity; it still denotes a tonsil suturing needle. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It maps to 'Tonsil suturing needle' (465593005). A parent 'suturing needle' is insufficiently specific to tonsil use, and sibling devices for tonsil procedures are not implied. No attributes (e.g., size, curvature, brand) are added in the entry."
405269005,Neonatal intensive care unit (environment),NICU (neonatal intensive care unit),"The entry provides the abbreviation and its expansion, unequivocally identifying the neonatal intensive care unit environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It should be coded to Neonatal intensive care unit (environment) [405269005], not to generic ICU or pediatric ICU. The synonym expansion ensures clarity without adding attributes like level or admission."
731334005,Entire superior labial vein (body structure),Superior labial vein (entire),"The parenthetical ‘entire’ clarifies that the reference is to the whole vessel, which aligns exactly with the Body structure concept “Entire superior labial vein (body structure)” SCTID 731334005. It is more specific than broader parent concepts and excludes sibling structures. There is no suggestion of a branch, segment, or laterality, so child concepts are not appropriate, and no disorder/procedure context is introduced."
15019003,Posthodiplostomum (organism),Posthodiplostomum taxonomic record,"This entry presents a taxonomic record for Posthodiplostomum, implying the genus-level organism without adding species, host, or clinical findings. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 15019003 is the most precise match. Parent taxa (e.g., Trematoda) are overly broad, and child species are not named. The wording is a neutral synonym maintaining the organism concept."
216401005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, hotel (environment)",Occurrence setting: hotel,"The text captures the occurrence setting as hotel, which directly corresponds to the environment value for place of occurrence of accident/poisoning. No additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, with SCTID 216401005 as the exact match. Broader parents would be less precise, and alternatives or sublocations (e.g., motel, hotel room) are not suggested by the wording. 'Setting' is a conventional synonym and does not change the code selection."
12871000087103,Biopsy of right upper limb using computed tomography guidance (procedure),CT-guided biopsy of the right upper extremity,"The text specifies a biopsy procedure, the right upper extremity location, and CT guidance, aligning directly with a Procedure concept. “Upper extremity” is a standard synonym of “upper limb,” preserving the intended site. No additional attributes like approach, tissue type, or reason are included, keeping the granularity consistent with the regional concept. Parent concepts without right laterality or guidance are too broad; siblings with other modalities or sides do not match the wording."
88971002,Embolization of artery of upper limb (procedure),Upper extremity arterial embolization was done,"The sentence denotes completion of arterial embolization in the upper extremity. Main concept: embolization of an artery in the upper limb. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This aligns with SCTID 88971002 since it clearly identifies embolization of an upper limb artery without adding details like side, device, or target lesion. Parent concepts lack the anatomical region; child concepts specify particular arteries or laterality, which the text does not. The wording is equivalent and preserves coding precision."
398097006,Relief note (record artifact),Relief note (record artifact),"This entry names the artifact and clarifies its SNOMED hierarchy by explicitly stating it is a record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Relief note (record artifact) [398097006] is the precise concept because it matches the exact document type. A parent like “Document” would be too general, and sibling note types (e.g., “progress note”) would not fit. Adding “record artifact” serves only to specify the category, not to introduce any new clinical attributes, keeping the code selection unchanged."
395066006,Serum alpha-2 macroglobulin level (procedure),Serum alpha-2 macroglobulin level evaluation,"“Evaluation” here denotes conducting a test to determine the level of alpha-2 macroglobulin in serum, equivalent in meaning to measurement/assay. The elements are analyte (alpha-2 macroglobulin), specimen (serum), and quantitative level, indicating a Procedure. SCTID 395066006 is appropriate because it is the specific serum alpha-2 macroglobulin level procedure. Parent or sibling procedures that are broader or use different specimens or analytes would not match the precise phrasing given."
411751000,Petrosilenum crispum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Petrosilenum crispum test allergen extract (diagnostic product),"The phrase 'test allergen extract (diagnostic product)' specifies a diagnostic allergen extract, and Petrosilenum crispum identifies the source species. Main concept: Petrosilenum crispum diagnostic allergen extract product. SNOMED CT category: Product. This is not a parent concept because the species is specified, nor a sibling such as other plant allergen extracts. It does not introduce dose, route, or technique, so SCTID 411751000 is the precise match. 'Test allergen' is a standard synonym for diagnostic allergen."
762995007,Oral nutritional support ended (situation),Oral nutritional support ended,"The entry explicitly states that oral nutritional support has ended, conveying cessation of an oral nutrition intervention. The main concept is the termination of oral nutritional support, with the single attribute being its ended status. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Situation, because it documents a state regarding a prior intervention rather than a disorder or procedure. SCTID 762995007 precisely represents “Oral nutritional support ended (situation).” Broader parent concepts like “Nutritional support ended” are less specific because they do not constrain the route to oral, and sibling concepts such as “Enteral nutrition ended” or “Parenteral nutrition ended” would be incorrect given the explicit oral route. No additional attributes (reason, timing beyond ‘ended’, severity) are introduced."
261761006,Deltoid splitting approach (qualifier value),Access achieved using deltoid-splitting approach,"This states that access was achieved with the deltoid-splitting approach, with no additional procedural or anatomical attributes. It’s a Qualifier value for the access technique and corresponds to 261761006. Broader or sibling approaches are not suggested. The phrase is a direct paraphrase, preserving clinical meaning and code selection."
242929006,Assault by pushing into path of moving motor vehicle (event),EMS notes: assault; pushed into path of a moving motor vehicle.,"This EMS-context documentation presents the external cause clearly: assault with pushing into the path of a moving motor vehicle. It is an Event and maps precisely to SNOMED CT 242929006. The omission of outcomes, timing, place, and vehicle subtype ensures it does not align better with broader parents or different siblings like collision-based or non-motor vehicle scenarios. The phrasing retains the exact attributes of the preferred concept."
37341000000109,Alert note (record artifact),Alert note listed in the record,"This states that the alert note is listed within the record, emphasizing the artifact’s presence without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and Alert note (record artifact) is the exact match. The broader parent Record artifact would fail to identify that the artifact is specifically an alert note, and no subtype is indicated by the text. 'Listed in the record' is an equivalent way to describe inclusion and does not alter the concept."
315591006,Fibrates contraindicated (situation),Plan: exclude fibrates—contraindicated,"The plan entry expresses exclusion of fibrates based on contraindication, clearly tied to the fibrate class and not to a specific agent. It remains a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 315591006 is the correct mapping. Broader exclusions (e.g., all lipid-lowering agents) are not indicated, and no single drug is mentioned to warrant a child concept."
301961009,Optic disc normal (finding),Ophthalmoscopy: optic disc normal,"This entry states a normal optic disc finding identified via ophthalmoscopy; the method does not change the core finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps to 301961009 Optic disc normal (finding) since it documents the normal disc. Parent categories such as normal fundus are less specific and siblings addressing specific abnormalities are not appropriate. The statement avoids laterality and other attributes, maintaining alignment with the general normal optic disc concept."
430387006,"Combined specimen of cytologic material from endocervix, ectocervix, and vaginal fornix (specimen)","Cytology sample, tri-site combined—endocervix, ectocervix, vaginal fornix.","This entry describes a cytology sample combining three sites: endocervix, ectocervix, and vaginal fornix. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It directly matches SCTID 430387006, which specifies a combined specimen from exactly these locations. A parent concept without site detail or a sibling concept lacking the fornix would be less accurate. The 'tri-site combined' phrasing is a synonym for 'combined specimen' and does not alter code selection or introduce extra attributes."
223798001,Kerry (geographic location),Kerry (Republic of Ireland),"Indicating ""Republic of Ireland"" refines country context but the coded concept remains the county Kerry. The SNOMED CT category is Location, and the exact match is SCTID 223798001. Using the country name does not introduce a new attribute; it avoids ambiguity. Parent concepts like Ireland alone would be too broad, and other localities would be incorrect. The phrase remains an equivalent representation of the same county."
444561001,Birth certificate (record artifact),Birth certificate on file,"This text references the artifact 'birth certificate' and adds workflow context ('on file') indicating presence in the record. The core concept remains the document artifact; the status phrase does not change the target code. Hence, the best match is SNOMED CT 444561001 Birth certificate (record artifact). Mapping to a parent like Document on file would be less specific and to a process (e.g., filing) would be inappropriate. No sibling or child concept is invoked since it does not specify variant types (e.g., live birth) or copies."
262476004,Pulpudeva (qualifier value),Label reads: Pulpudeva,"The concept conveyed is the location name Pulpudeva, with 'Label reads' serving as documentation context. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is 262476004 within the Qualifier value hierarchy. No extra attributes are introduced, so a generic parent would be less specific and a sibling would be a different place. The entry unambiguously points to the named location concept Pulpudeva."
256979002,B*1504 (substance),HLA-B*1504 (antigen specificity),"The text references the antigen specificity HLA-B*1504, which corresponds to an HLA-B allele modeled as a Substance. SCTID 256979002 B*1504 (substance) is the precise code, as it denotes this particular antigen specificity. Parent concepts like HLA-B antigen or B*15 family are not sufficiently specific, and siblings (e.g., B*1501, B*1502) differ in specificity. The parenthetical wording describes context without introducing additional clinical attributes, maintaining equivalence."
217450009,Hit by object falling from burning school (event),Hit by object that fell from a school on fire.,"The entry states that an object fell from a school that was on fire and hit the person, maintaining the core elements of the concept. “School on fire” is a direct synonym of “burning school,” so the category remains Event and matches SCTID 217450009. More general or alternate-setting concepts (e.g., burning building without school specificity) would be less precise, and no extra clinical attributes are added."
736335005,Structure of soft tissue of right shoulder (body structure),Soft tissue anatomy of the right shoulder,"This entry emphasizes the anatomical soft tissue components of the right shoulder without implying pathology or procedure. Attributes: soft tissue; right shoulder laterality. SNOMED category: Body structure. SCTID 736335005 is the precise match, representing the soft tissue anatomy of the right shoulder. A parent like 'Right shoulder anatomy' would include bones and joint structures, which are not intended. Child concepts such as 'Right supraspinatus tendon' are too specific. 'Soft tissue anatomy' is a synonymic framing of the same site and does not change the code."
364045000,Tonsil observable (observable entity),Tonsil characteristic (observable entity),"“Characteristic” functions as a synonym for an observable attribute and is explicitly categorized as an observable entity for the tonsil. Category: Observable entity. SNOMED 364045000 is appropriate because it represents the tonsil’s characteristics to be observed, without describing a finding or a result. More general observables lack anatomical scope, while more specific child concepts would name a particular characteristic. No extraneous attributes are introduced."
260613001,Transconjunctival approach (qualifier value),Surgeon went in through the conjunctiva,"This patient-style statement indicates the access route used by the surgeon was through the conjunctiva, which is the transconjunctival approach. The concept is a Qualifier value that describes the route rather than a standalone procedure. It precisely corresponds to Transconjunctival approach, not broader or different approaches. The phrase does not add any other attributes like site, laterality, or procedure type; it purely expresses the approach, making 260613001 the correct selection."
434056006,Chlorobaculum thiosulfatiphilum (organism),Catalog entry: Chlorobaculum thiosulfatiphilum,"As a catalog entry, the text lists the species Chlorobaculum thiosulfatiphilum without additional attributes, signifying the organism itself. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The exact species organism concept (SCTID 434056006) is appropriate. Using a parent genus concept would reduce specificity, and neither strain-level children nor sibling species are implied."
224854003,Comprehensive school (environment),Comprehensive school listed as setting,"The documentation lists the setting as a comprehensive school, indicating an environmental context. SNOMED CT category is Environment. The explicit type ‘comprehensive’ ensures the selection of the precise concept rather than general school or other educational environments. The phrasing is synonymous with environment and does not add causative or temporal attributes."
87574004,o-Aminophenol oxidase (substance),o-AP oxidase (o-aminophenol oxidase),The abbreviation “o-AP oxidase” is expanded in parentheses to ensure unambiguous identification of the same enzyme substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps directly to SCTID 87574004 and not to broader oxidase groups or different-substrate enzymes. The synonym does not add attributes or change the concept.
399624001,Tissue specimen from ureter (specimen),Accession lists ureter tissue specimen,"The wording indicates that the accessioned material is a specimen of ureter tissue, which is a Specimen category entry. It maps precisely to Tissue specimen from ureter (399624001) because it presents both the specimen type (tissue) and source (ureter) without method, laterality, or diagnostic details. Selecting the broader Specimen from ureter would not capture the tissue specificity. Choosing a child concept such as a biopsy specimen would add procedural attributes not documented. The context of accessioning is operational and does not affect the specimen concept."
736381005,Major surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Progress note: refer to the inpatient major surgery care plan,The progress note points to the existence of the care plan artifact for inpatient major surgery. The core concept is the plan document; attributes include major surgery and inpatient setting. Category: Record artifact. This does not imply creation or modification of a plan (which could be procedural); it references the artifact. Parent or sibling concepts lacking either qualifier would be less precise; 736381005 is the correct selection.
42248000,Methyl orange stain (substance),Methyl orange stain,"The entry explicitly names the substance methyl orange stain, which is a laboratory staining chemical. The main medical concept is the stain itself, with no added attributes such as concentration, mixture, or procedural use. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This precisely matches SCTID 42248000 because it denotes the specific stain reagent, not the act of staining or a different chemical. Parent concepts like generic stains or methyl orange without the stain role would be less specific, and sibling stains (e.g., methyl red stain) would be incorrect. No procedural wording is present, so a procedure code is not appropriate."
149077008,Entire arterial tufts of cochlea (body structure),Arterial tufts of cochlea,"This phrase denotes the specific arterial tuft structures located in the cochlea, with no additional qualifiers or clinical attributes. The category is Body structure. Although the wording omits “entire,” in SNOMED CT anatomy, the unqualified structure term maps to the “Entire” concept, making 149077008 the precise code. A parent concept like “Cochlea” is too broad, while siblings such as “Cochlear artery” or “Cochlear vasculature” are different structures; this entry focuses specifically on the arterial tufts, not on an artery or a general vascular bed."
117806001,Measurement of Human echovirus 9 antibody (procedure),Serologic assay for echovirus 9 antibody,"This explicitly names a serologic assay targeting echovirus 9 antibodies, i.e., an antibody measurement procedure. The main concept is measurement of antibodies to echovirus 9. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This maps most accurately to 117806001, not to broader parents nor to more specific child concepts (e.g., assay-method-specific codes or immunoglobulin class tests). ‘Serologic assay’ is a clinically equivalent term for antibody measurement and does not introduce any additional attributes."
411802009,Bombus terrestris diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract: Bombus terrestris,"This entry conveys a diagnostic allergen extract and clearly ties it to Bombus terrestris, ensuring species specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The exact match is 411802009, as it denotes the Bombus terrestris diagnostic allergen extract. A more general parent would omit the species, while siblings correspond to other species or non-diagnostic products. The colon formatting does not introduce extra attributes and maintains equivalence to the preferred term."
186052007,Formal complaint about GP RE: self (procedure),Formal complaint recorded about general practitioner re self,"The entry notes that a formal complaint has been 'recorded' about a general practitioner and references 're self', which aligns with the defined administrative procedure. Category: Procedure. SCTID 186052007 is the correct code, as it matches formal complaint, GP specificity, and the self subject. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts involving other roles or non-self targets are mismatches. 'Recorded' reflects documentation of the procedure without changing its meaning."
275903009,History of carcinoma (situation),Medical history significant for carcinoma.,"The wording places carcinoma within the medical history, emphasizing relevance but not introducing site, subtype, or treatment status. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This maps to 275903009 History of carcinoma, not to an active carcinoma disorder. Parent concepts like History of malignancy are too broad, and sibling/child concepts specifying other neoplasm types or sites are inappropriate. The phrase is a clinically valid synonym for a history situation."
285095000,Road tunnel (environment),Within a road tunnel,"The wording conveys being within the specific environment of a road tunnel, exactly matching Road tunnel (environment), SCTID 285095000. The main concept is the environmental location without additional clinical or temporal attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This is more specific than Tunnel (environment) due to the road qualifier and does not suggest a different transport context, so siblings such as Railway tunnel or Underpass are inappropriate given the explicit road context."
216346005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, industrial yard (environment)",Poisoning incident took place in the industrial yard,"The entry clearly anchors a poisoning event to the industrial yard as the place of occurrence. The main concept is the environmental location associated with poisoning, making the Environment or geographical location category appropriate. The best match is Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, industrial yard (environment) [216346005], since it specifically covers industrial yards. Parents like industrial area or siblings such as warehouse or factory building refer to different settings and would be less precise. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and adds no extra attributes."
736339004,Orthopedic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient orthopaedic surgery plan of care in the medical record,"The sentence clearly identifies a plan of care (care plan) for inpatients under orthopaedic surgery, explicitly as part of the medical record, i.e., a record artifact. This best matches Orthopedic surgery inpatient care plan (736339004). Generic inpatient plans or non-orthopedic surgical plans would be parents and less specific, while outpatient variants are siblings and incorrect. The entry avoids additional attributes like diagnosis or timing, ensuring unique mapping."
411827002,Penicillium frequentans diagnostic allergen extract (product),Report lists Penicillium frequentans diagnostic allergen extract among test reagents,"The entry denotes that the diagnostic allergen extract for Penicillium frequentans is included as a test reagent, highlighting the product used. The main concept is the diagnostic allergen extract product. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). This corresponds to SCTID 411827002. Parents that are more generic or siblings such as therapeutic extracts or non-product substances would not capture the diagnostic product. 'Test reagents' is a synonymous context term that does not modify the product’s identity."
782163002,Mecysteine (substance),Ingredient record—mecysteine,"Framing the entry as an ingredient record highlights mecysteine as a substance in documentation. The category is Substance. This best matches Mecysteine (substance), SCTID 782163002, since only the identity of the ingredient is specified. No details that would shift coding to medicinal products, specific salts, or class concepts are present. The record context does not add attributes beyond naming the substance."
414294007,Freeway off-ramp (environment),Scene location documented: motorway off-ramp,"This captures the scene location as a motorway off-ramp. The main concept is the off-ramp environment; no mechanism or temporal qualifiers are included. The SNOMED CT category is 'Environment or geographical location'. The term targets the off-ramp specifically and not a general motorway segment or an on-ramp, justifying SCTID 414294007."
227890002,Nut dishes (substance),Nut culinary preparations,"“Nut culinary preparations” identifies prepared food items whose defining feature is nuts, equivalent to nut dishes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Though phrased as “preparations,” the culinary context conveys dish-level food items without adding timing or specific nut types. Parent concepts like “Nuts (substance)” lack the prepared dish specificity, and child/sibling concepts would over-specify or mis-specify. SCTID 227890002 is the correct code."
732199006,Entire teres minor muscle and tendon (body structure),Full teres minor myotendinous unit,"The term 'myotendinous unit' is a clinical synonym for the muscle–tendon unit, and 'full' conveys entirety. The focus is purely anatomical, so the SNOMED CT Body structure 'Entire teres minor muscle and tendon' (SCTID: 732199006) is the most precise match. Parent concepts that encompass multiple muscles or regional structures are too broad, and sibling concepts that specify only the muscle or only the tendon are too narrow. This synonym does not introduce any extra attributes or clinical findings."
710184005,Mutton (substance),Mutton listed in chart,"This entry indicates mutton is listed in a chart, with no added qualifiers such as processing, quantity, or time; it identifies only the substance. The SNOMED CT Substance category concept Mutton (substance), SCTID 710184005 is the exact match. More generic parent concepts would reduce specificity, and the sibling concept lamb would be inaccurate. Chart-listing context does not change the substance being coded."
16221371000119107,Urine specimen obtained from pediatric urine collection bag (specimen),Peds urine bag urine specimen,"Using 'Peds' as an accepted abbreviation for pediatric, this entry identifies a urine specimen collected via a pediatric urine bag. It falls under the SNOMED Specimen category and corresponds to Urine specimen obtained from pediatric urine collection bag (16221371000119107). It avoids broader or different collection methods and does not add extraneous attributes, making it the most precise code selection."
736402001,Hip fracture inpatient care plan (record artifact),Hip fracture inpatient care plan documented,"This indicates the care plan artifact for an inpatient hip fracture has been documented, focusing on the existence of the record. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It fits “Hip fracture inpatient care plan (record artifact)” SCTID 736402001, as the status of being documented does not alter the underlying artifact concept. Parent/sibling concepts (generic inpatient care plan, outpatient care plan, treatment plan) do not capture the condition specificity with inpatient setting. It is not the disorder itself."
721923008,Obstetrics and gynecology discharge summary (record artifact),OB/GYN specialty discharge summary,"This entry indicates a discharge summary attributed to the OB/GYN specialty, clearly identifying a medical record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It aligns with 'Obstetrics and gynecology discharge summary (record artifact)' because it states both the type (discharge summary) and the specific specialty (OB/GYN). Choosing a generic discharge summary would be too broad, while selecting obstetric-only or gynecology-only would not match the combined specialty named here. No condition, procedure, or timing details are implied."
219197006,Assault by drowning (event),Mechanism: assault by drowning,"Stating the mechanism as assault by drowning aligns with the SNOMED CT concept Assault by drowning (event) [219197006]. The main concept is an event where the injury mechanism is drowning with assault intent. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Using just Assault (event) would omit the mechanism, and Drowning (event) would omit the interpersonal intent. The wording is a clinically equivalent framing and adds no new attributes beyond those inherent to the concept."
418431005,Accident to watercraft involving collision (event),Care note: watercraft collision accident,"This describes, in a care note context, an accidental collision involving a watercraft, without adding location, injuries, or time. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It aligns with SCTID 418431005 because it captures an accident to a watercraft that involved a collision. Parent concepts like generic ‘accident’ or ‘collision’ lack the combined specificity, and child concepts that would require stating what was collided with are not supported by the text. The care note context is neutral regarding code selection."
726739006,Pathologist review (record artifact),History entry: pathologist review,"Here, the pathologist review is referenced in a history documentation context, still expressing the record artifact rather than a clinical action or finding. It maps to SCTID 726739006 in the Record artifact category due to precise identification of the pathologist reviewer. More generic historical documentation artifacts would be insufficiently specific, and reviewer-specific siblings for other professions would be wrong. The term “history entry” is contextual and does not introduce attributes like timing or outcome for the review itself, leaving the code selection unchanged."
223939003,Lothian (geographic location),Lothian geographic entity,"Calling Lothian a 'geographic entity' still identifies the same place, aligning with Lothian (geographic location) [223939003]. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The term is a neutral synonym describing a territorial area and does not suggest a different administrative or organizational concept. It excludes broader parents (e.g., Scotland) and narrower children, maintaining a unique, precise reference to Lothian."
430195004,Vitamin K intake (observable entity),Vitamin K intake observed,"Observation refers to the process, but the content is the intake of vitamin K, which is the observable entity. The most precise code is Vitamin K intake (SCTID 430195004). No details about amount or time are present, so more general nutrient intake or different concepts (e.g., vitamin K therapy) are not applicable."
171415121000119104,History of revision of ventriculopleural shunt (situation),Problem list: history of VPL shunt revision,"This problem-list entry records the history of a VPL (ventriculopleural) shunt revision. Main concept: historical revision of a ventriculopleural shunt; attribute: past context. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 171415121000119104 is the exact fit because it is device-specific and denotes history. Using a general shunt revision history code would be too broad, and choosing a procedure code would imply an active intervention. The abbreviation is a standard synonym and does not add attributes."
894131005,Measured quantity of intake of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight in 24 hours (observable entity),"Dietary carbs consumed per kilogram of body weight in 24 hours, measured amount","This statement indicates a measured amount of dietary carbohydrate intake per kilogram body weight over 24 hours, mapping precisely to SNOMED CT 894131005 (Observable entity). The components are carbohydrate intake, body‑weight normalization, and 24‑hour timeframe. Parent or sibling concepts that are not weight‑indexed or that focus on other nutrients or macronutrient proportions would be less accurate. Using 'carbs' as a colloquial synonym for carbohydrate remains clinically equivalent and does not alter the observable’s attributes."
16213651000119102,Duodenal ulcer specimen (specimen),Sample from duodenal ulcer,"This entry states a sample was taken specifically from a duodenal ulcer without specifying method or specimen subtype. It is a SNOMED CT Specimen and corresponds precisely to Duodenal ulcer specimen (SCTID 16213651000119102). Broader parents such as gastrointestinal specimens fail to capture the ulcer source, and narrower children like biopsy specimens introduce an unstated collection approach. Sibling concepts (e.g., peptic ulcer specimen, gastric ulcer specimen) are not accurate because the location here is explicitly the duodenal ulcer. ‘Sample’ is an accepted synonym for ‘specimen’ and does not alter the coding."
467423004,Carotid artery shunt (physical object),Equipment listed: carotid artery shunt,"The entry lists equipment and names it as a carotid artery shunt, pointing to a tangible device and not an action, within the Physical object category. The most accurate code is Carotid artery shunt (physical object), SCTID 467423004. The text avoids attributes such as laterality, permanence, or model. More general device parents lack carotid specificity, and procedural concepts are inappropriate because the entry does not describe insertion or use."
835277001,"Visible soft palate, fauces, uvula palatina, glossopalatine arch and pharyngopalatine arch (finding)","Clear view of soft palate, fauces, palatine uvula, palatoglossal arch, and palatopharyngeal arch.","This entry conveys that the soft palate, fauces, palatine uvula, and both arches are visible; 'clear view' remains within the visibility attribute without adding pathology or measurement. It is a Clinical finding corresponding to SCTID 835277001 due to inclusion of all specified structures. Parent or sibling concepts would be either too broad or incomplete. The phrasing is a permissible synonym for visibility and maintains the same code selection."
170853003,Rheumatology disorder treatment started (situation),Rheumatologic disease therapy commenced,"The entry indicates that therapy for a rheumatologic disease has commenced, which directly reflects the initiation of treatment in the rheumatology domain. The main concept is therapy start; no specific condition, drug, dose, timing beyond initiation, or associated factors are mentioned. This is a Situation concept and maps precisely to “Rheumatology disorder treatment started (situation)” SCTID 170853003. The synonym “therapy commenced” is equivalent to “treatment started” and does not change the coding. More general parent concepts would omit the rheumatology context, and more specific children or siblings would add details like specific medications or different treatment statuses, which are not present here."
702903001,Pediatric endocrinology clinic (environment),Pediatric endocrine subspecialty clinic,"This is a clinically equivalent synonym using ‘endocrine’ for ‘endocrinology’ and noting subspecialty—still an environment describing the same clinic, consistent with SNOMED CT 702903001. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling organizational units would be different categories. The wording adds no extra attributes that would shift coding away from the clinic environment."
122705002,Specimen from endometrium obtained by hysterectomy (specimen),Endometrium specimen retrieved at hysterectomy,"The entry conveys that the specimen is endometrium and that it was retrieved at the time of hysterectomy, expressing both anatomical site and method. This is a Specimen concept matching SCTID 122705002. More general uterine specimens or endometrium specimens without method detail would be less precise, and other sampling methods are excluded by the hysterectomy reference."
293894003,Allergy to chlordiazepoxide (finding),Do not administer chlordiazepoxide—patient allergic,"This instruction indicates the presence of an allergy specifically to chlordiazepoxide, with no reaction detail or class-level generalization. It is a Clinical finding and best fits Allergy to chlordiazepoxide (finding), SCTID 293894003. While management language is present, the underlying concept is the named drug allergy. Coding to generic drug allergy or benzodiazepine allergy would reduce specificity, and sibling concepts for other drugs would not match the named agent."
229763006,Gigahertz (qualifier value),Frequency scale unit — GHz,"This entry labels 'GHz' as the unit used on the frequency scale, which denotes gigahertz as a unit. SNOMED CT models units as Qualifier value concepts, and this maps directly to Gigahertz (qualifier value). No measurement values or device context are included, keeping the statement unit-only. Choosing 'Hertz' or sibling units would not match the specified abbreviation. 'GHz' is a standard synonym for gigahertz and does not change the coding."
79811009,"Electric blanket, device (physical object)",Electric blanket included on device inventory,"The phrasing specifies an electric blanket listed as a device, emphasizing the object type. Main concept: electric blanket device; no added clinical attributes. SNOMED category: Physical object (Device). This matches 79811009 Electric blanket, device. Parent blanket concepts lack the electrical attribute, while siblings such as heating pads or other warming systems are not blankets; the inventory context does not change the device identification."
8586007,"Postprandial gastric acid secretory response, function (observable entity)",Stomach acid secretion response after food intake,"The phrase captures gastric acid secretion response following food intake, i.e., postprandial. “Stomach” is equivalent to “gastric,” and “after food intake” equals “postprandial.” As an Observable entity, the entry lacks measurement values, method, or interpretation, preventing misclassification as a test or finding. It is specific for acid and for postprandial timing, avoiding broader parent categories, and does not narrow to abnormal subtypes. SCTID 8586007 is the most precise mapping."
417743007,"Blood cell destruction, function (observable entity)",Lab report documents blood cell destruction function,"This situates the function observable within a laboratory report context, stating documentation of the blood cell destruction function without any abnormality or subtype information. Category: Observable entity. The exact code 417743007 corresponds to the function being documented. Child/sibling concepts such as erythrocyte-specific destruction or clinical findings would not fit this neutral phrasing. The context of 'lab report' does not change the observable entity selection."
88817006,Exposure to inanimate mechanical force (event),Exposure to nonliving mechanical force,"The wording uses 'nonliving' as a synonym for 'inanimate', which is clinically equivalent and does not change the intended concept. It denotes an external cause Event rather than a disorder, matching SNOMED CT 88817006. The specification of nonliving excludes animate mechanical force, so the sibling concept is inappropriate. The entry does not specify a particular mechanism (e.g., machinery, collision), so child concepts are not indicated. The parent concept without the inanimate qualifier would be less precise, confirming 88817006 as the correct code."
223707000,Puerto Rico (geographic location),Puerto Rico (island),"Adding “(island)” denotes the geographic nature of Puerto Rico without introducing unrelated attributes. The main concept remains the place Puerto Rico. Category: Location (Geographic location). This precisely corresponds to SCTID: 223707000 and does not better match a parent (general location) or child (specific county/municipality). Siblings (other islands/places) are not relevant due to the explicit name. “(island)” is a neutral clarifier of the same entity, not altering code selection."
217793008,Suffocation by regurgitated food (event),Nursing documentation: suffocation by regurgitated food,"The phrase conveys a suffocation event caused by regurgitated food, with 'Nursing documentation:' serving as context only. It is within the SNOMED CT Event category and aligns with 'Suffocation by regurgitated food (event)'. Choosing a parent like 'Asphyxiation (event)' would be less precise, and sibling concepts such as 'Suffocation by vomitus' would be inaccurate because this specifies regurgitated food. The wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not introduce extra attributes."
411731004,Myristica fragrans diagnostic allergen extract (product),Myristica fragrans diagnostic allergen testing reagent,"The statement labels the item as a diagnostic allergen testing reagent derived from Myristica fragrans, indicating a product used in allergy diagnostics. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). This corresponds to SCTID 411731004; using “reagent” is a clinically acceptable synonym for diagnostic allergen extract in testing contexts and does not alter the code selection. Parent or sibling concepts involving therapeutic use or unspecified source are less precise. No route, concentration, or specific test modality is implied."
77931003,Rural health center (environment),Rural health centre location,"Using UK spelling, this entry indicates that the relevant location is a rural health centre. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 77931003 is the most precise match because the phrase specifies both the facility type (health centre) and rural context. Broader parent concepts or different facility-type siblings would be less appropriate. There are no added attributes beyond location."
224910005,Seventh floor (environment),Seventh floor,"The entry explicitly names the building level as “Seventh floor,” which directly corresponds to the SNOMED CT concept Seventh floor (environment), SCTID 224910005. The main concept is a specific floor number in a building; there are no additional attributes such as department, timing, or event. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (semantic tag: environment). This exact phrasing avoids broader parents like Floor of building (environment) and excludes siblings such as Sixth floor or Eighth floor. No child concepts (e.g., seventh-floor corridor) are implied, making SCTID 224910005 the most precise match."
1264489001,Presence of melanoma in situ at surgical margin in excised specimen of skin (observable entity),Tumor board summary: melanoma in situ present at the skin specimen surgical margin,"The summary states presence of melanoma in situ at the surgical margin of a skin specimen, fitting the Observable entity. SCTID 1264489001 is the precise match. Broader margin positivity or different histologic categories (e.g., invasive melanoma) are excluded by the wording. No additional attributes are appended."
445616004,Report with official legal status (record artifact),Report constitutes an official legal record,Saying a report constitutes an official legal record conveys that the report holds official legal status. Main concept: report; attribute: official legal standing as a record. Category: Record artifact. It is a direct match because the legal status is emphasized for a report. Using 'record' here does not shift the artifact type away from 'report' but clarifies its legal status. Broader 'legal document' or generic 'report' would be less precise.
768688006,Product containing strontium and/or strontium compound (product),Historical: previously on a strontium-containing product,"A historical note of prior use of a strontium-containing product aligns with 'Product containing strontium and/or strontium compound' (768688006). Category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The statement does not introduce specificity regarding salt, isotope, route, dose, or indication, so broader or narrower concepts would be less appropriate. The wording remains a clinically equivalent synonym for the grouper."
103897005,Lu^b^ blood group typing (procedure),Lu^b blood group typing conducted,"This documentation indicates that Lu^b blood group typing was conducted, without adding result or method attributes. The core concept is the Lu^b antigen typing procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps precisely to Lu^b blood group typing (procedure), SCTID 103897005, because the wording centers on typing for the specific Lu^b antigen. Parent concepts like general RBC antigen typing are too broad, and sibling concepts such as Lu^a typing or anti-Lu^b antibody testing differ in the analyte. Child-level variants (result-positive/negative or method-specific) are not implied, securing the precise match."
1149454006,Annual physical examination for people with mental illness completed (situation),Annual physical exam performed and completed for patient with mental illness.,"This entry indicates that the annual physical exam was performed and completed for a patient in the mental illness cohort. The principal concept is the completion of the annual physical exam for people with mental illness, which is a Situation. SCTID 1149454006 is the best fit because it captures the annual cadence, physical exam, mental illness context, and completion status. A generic completed annual physical would be a parent concept and less precise. The words “performed and completed” reinforce completion without adding outcome, provider, or location, maintaining alignment with the specific situation code."
398533001,"Salmonella I, group O:9,46 (organism)","Salmonella I (O-group 9,46)","The entry states the organism Salmonella I and specifies its O-group 9,46, which is a clinically equivalent way to express the O:9,46 serogroup. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This best matches SCTID 398533001 by naming the exact organism grouping. Parent concepts lack this specificity, and selecting a child like a particular serovar would add detail not provided and potentially miscode the entry."
704008007,No family history of asthma (situation),Health maintenance: Family hx of asthma—no.,"The abbreviation “hx” denotes history; this confirms no family history of asthma. The main concept is the absence of asthma in the family, a Situation with explicit context. SNOMED 704008007 matches specifically. It avoids broader negations or personal history and keeps the mapping tightly focused on asthma in the family context."
437884005,Single cuff tourniquet (physical object),Inventory: single cuff tourniquet,"Inventory context labels the item, and 'single cuff tourniquet' is the device specification that corresponds to the Physical object Single cuff tourniquet (SCTID 437884005). No additional attributes are introduced; this avoids mapping to generic tourniquet or to sibling designs like double cuff."
469201006,Fluoroscopic x-ray system video image recording unit (physical object),Fluoroscopy video recorder module,"This identifies a module that functions as a video recorder for fluoroscopy. Main concept: recording unit component of a fluoroscopic x-ray system. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 469201006 is the best fit because it specifies a video image recording unit for fluoroscopy. Parent terms (generic module or recorder) are nonspecific; siblings (e.g., image intensifier module) perform different roles. 'Module' here is a form factor synonym that does not alter attributes or code selection."
788321000,Product containing hypothalamic inhibiting factor (product),Supply request for product containing hypothalamic inhibiting factor,"A supply request mentions a product characterized by containing hypothalamic inhibiting factor. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This maps to SCTID 788321000 because the definition is constrained to ingredient content without dose, route, or branding. It is not a procurement procedure code; the target concept is the product itself. It avoids substance-only and more detailed clinical drug children."
224000004,Island in region of North America (geographic location),Island within North America,"The entry denotes the type 'island' and the regional context 'within North America,' mapping precisely to SNOMED CT 224000004. Category: Geographic location. It avoids additional attributes and does not mention specific jurisdictions, maintaining the intended granularity. A generic island concept would be less precise, while sibling concepts for other regions would be inconsistent with the stated North America qualifier. The phrasing is an acceptable, equivalent paraphrase."
394888000,Hormone replacement therapy requested (situation),Request to receive hormone replacement therapy,"This phrase states a request to receive HRT, maintaining the request context without implying that therapy has been ordered or administered. It belongs to the Situation category and maps directly to SCTID 394888000. Choosing broader or different-status concepts (e.g., therapy requested generally, HRT planned, HRT initiated) would misrepresent the content. The wording is a clinically safe paraphrase that preserves the same concept."
25911000087103,Transitional housing (environment),Transitional housing documented as residence,"The statement identifies transitional housing as the residence environment, aligning with the environment concept. The category is Environment. The wording does not add causation or timing. A parent code for residence environment would be too broad, and other specific housing types (siblings) like shelter or halfway house are not present."
468093003,Bronchoscopy tube (physical object),Tube used for bronchoscopy,"This entry defines a tube whose intended use is bronchoscopy, which matches the device concept 'Bronchoscopy tube.' The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). It is the most accurate code (468093003) because the phrasing restricts the tube's use to bronchoscopy, distinguishing it from generic tubes and from airway tubes like endotracheal or bronchial isolation tubes. It also does not describe the bronchoscope itself. The paraphrase does not introduce additional attributes such as size, rigidity, or sterile status, maintaining equivalence."
736359000,Minor surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Minor surgery inpatient care plan,"The entry explicitly denotes a care plan for an inpatient undergoing minor surgery, which directly matches the SNOMED CT concept 'Minor surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact)'. The main concept is a plan of care tailored to minor surgical management within an inpatient setting, with no added attributes such as timing, severity, or specific procedure types. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, as this is a documented plan. A broader parent like an 'inpatient care plan' or 'surgical care plan' would be less specific, and siblings such as 'major surgery inpatient care plan' or 'outpatient minor surgery care plan' would not fit due to the explicit minor and inpatient context. 'Minor surgery' and 'care plan' are standard, clinically equivalent terms that do not change the code selection."
114222004,Rickettsiella stethorae (organism),Microbial species — Rickettsiella stethorae,"This entry phrasing presents the organism as a microbial species and specifies Rickettsiella stethorae. The main concept is the organism species, fitting the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy and mapping to Rickettsiella stethorae (organism) [114222004]. It does not indicate infection, presence, or test outcomes, so disease or result-related concepts would be inappropriate. 'Microbial species' is a descriptive synonym that does not alter the species-level code."
771398004,Stability of lumbar spine joint (observable entity),Parameter: lumbar spine joint stability,"Referring to stability as a 'parameter' clearly indicates an observable characteristic of lumbar spine joints. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, because the term denotes a property subject to evaluation or measurement, not a diagnosis. This is the precise scope of 'Stability of lumbar spine joint' and excludes values, severity, or etiology. Parents without lumbar specificity are less precise, while siblings focusing on the lumbar region as a whole rather than the joint would be misaligned. Children specifying level (e.g., L4–L5 joint stability) or an abnormal result would go beyond the stated concept."
1237449007,International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework - Soft and Bite Sized Level 6 (qualifier value),Nursing flowsheet: IDDSI Level 6 – Soft & Bite-Sized,This is a flowsheet entry indicating IDDSI Level 6 Soft & Bite-Sized. The context does not alter the qualifier value or add attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The entry is a precise match to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework - Soft and Bite Sized Level 6 concept. Parent or sibling concepts are inappropriate here because the wording specifically names Level 6 and the standardized descriptor Soft & Bite-Sized.
122690005,Specimen from left kidney obtained by radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy (specimen),Lab receiving: left kidney specimen from radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy,"The entry documents a specimen received in the lab, explicitly stating it is from the left kidney obtained by radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy, which maps precisely to SNOMED CT 122690005 (Specimen). It avoids parent concepts lacking procurement details and excludes siblings with differing laterality or missing adrenalectomy. No added attributes beyond the defined concept are present."
223369002,Country (geographic location),National-level location: country,"The entry describes a location at the national level, explicitly as a country, aligning with the intended geographic concept and avoiding any additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (Location). The most accurate code is Country (geographic location) [223369002]. Parent categories lack national specificity, and children (specific country names) or sibling location types (city, region, province) are not implied."
309214000,Gastric fundus biopsy specimen (specimen),Fundus (stomach) biopsy specimen,"This variant places “fundus” first with clarification that it refers to the stomach, coupled with “biopsy specimen.” The concept is a Specimen and aligns directly with SCTID 309214000. Less specific parents lack fundus designation, and child or sibling concepts would introduce additional layers or different gastric subsites. No timing, technique, or pathology details are introduced, preserving precise equivalence."
762844006,Bone structure of middle phalanx of left ring finger (body structure),Left ring finger middle phalanx skeletal structure,"‘Skeletal structure’ is commonly used to denote bone in anatomical documentation. Specifying the left ring finger’s middle phalanx keeps this as a Body structure and maps to SCTID 762844006. It is not a broader finger skeletal structure nor a different phalanx level. Child substructures (e.g., epiphysis) are not specified, keeping the granularity correct. No non-anatomic attributes are introduced."
225733006,Drinking bar (environment),Bar environment,"“Bar environment” names the place type and clearly conveys the drinking bar as the environmental context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This aligns with SCTID 225733006 as it focuses on the venue itself without introducing additional qualifiers. Broader parent concepts (e.g., general venue) or different sibling environments (e.g., nightclub, restaurant) would be less specific. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to a drinking bar."
702930006,Plastic surgery clinic (environment),Plastic surgery clinic listed under facilities,"The phrase catalogs the environment as a plastic surgery clinic among facilities, which maintains the focus on location. There are no added descriptors that would create a different code selection. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is 702930006 Plastic surgery clinic (environment) in the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. Broader parents like Clinic (environment) lack the specialty detail, and siblings such as Plastic surgery department or center are distinct facility types. The wording is equivalent and does not change the concept."
258611002,Sputum specimen obtained from sputum suction trap (specimen),Sputum trap specimen (suction trap),"The entry points to a sputum specimen and clarifies the device/method as a suction trap, making it an exact match to SCTID 258611002 under Specimen. The wording does not imply expectoration or bronchoscopy, avoiding siblings, and is more specific than the parent sputum specimen. “Trap specimen” here refers specifically to the suction trap; the parenthetical ensures clarity of the method without adding unrelated attributes."
257693000,Road roundabout (environment),Built environment: traffic circle,"The entry labels the built environment feature as a traffic circle, which is a synonym for road roundabout. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, and Road roundabout (environment) 257693000 is the most precise code. This does not generalize to a road intersection or specify a subtype (e.g., mini-roundabout), avoiding parent or child concepts. The synonym maintains equivalence and leaves the code selection unchanged."
782355005,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli serotype O112:H2 (organism),Identified organism—Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O112:H2,"This specifies identification of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli with serotype O112:H2, matching SCTID 782355005. Category: Organism. The description includes both the toxigenic characteristic and the precise serotype, making it more specific than parent concepts such as general E. coli or general STEC. Sibling serotypes would be incorrect. The wording does not assert a clinical condition, keeping the focus on the organism entity for coding."
10997451000119102,History of reversal of gastrostomy (situation),History note: gastrostomy reversal,"The entry places 'gastrostomy reversal' within a history note, directly conveying past procedural history without adding cause or outcome. It belongs to the SNOMED Situation with explicit context category. SCTID 10997451000119102 is the correct code because it expresses the history of a specific reversal procedure. Using the procedure-only code or broader history concepts would misalign with the exact phrasing. 'Gastrostomy reversal' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'reversal of gastrostomy,' not altering code selection."
718915001,Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States non-bizarre ideas level of distress score (observable entity),"Non-bizarre ideas—distress level score, Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States","This entry indicates the CAARMS distress level score specific to non-bizarre ideas. The key medical concept is a defined scale score; the attributes are the item (non-bizarre ideas) and the dimension (distress level). It is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT. Naming the full instrument (Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States) ensures specificity to SCTID 718915001. It does not suggest other CAARMS parameters, avoiding sibling codes (e.g., severity or frequency) or other items, and it is more specific than parent categories like generic CAARMS scores."
427936007,Benzhydryl derivative (substance),Belongs to benzhydryl derivatives,"The text specifies membership in the benzhydryl derivative class, which represents a structural substance group. This aligns with SNOMED CT 427936007 (Substance). There are no added clinical attributes or product semantics. Broader parents would dilute specificity, while children would enumerate individual benzhydryl compounds. Therefore, the benzhydryl derivative substance concept is the most precise mapping."
704528002,Nigerian sign language (qualifier value),Interpreter available: Nigerian Sign Language,"The entry states the availability of an interpreter for 'Nigerian Sign Language.' The coded concept is the language value itself, a Qualifier value with SCTID 704528002. Availability is contextual and does not introduce attributes that change the language concept. A parent concept like general sign language would be nonspecific, and sibling sign languages would not match the Nigerian sign language specified."
736382003,Major head and neck surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient care plan for a major head and neck surgical hospitalization,"The entry specifies a care plan in the inpatient (hospitalization) context for major head and neck surgery, which is a record artifact. The term 'hospitalization' reinforces the inpatient attribute without altering the concept. The attributes align with SCTID 736382003. It excludes outpatient or minor qualifiers and avoids representing a pathway or procedure, keeping the mapping precise."
4231000179109,Mammography report (record artifact),Radiologist report for mammography,"This denotes the interpretive report authored by a radiologist for a mammography exam, clearly a document artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the specific concept Mammography report (record artifact) is most appropriate. It is not the procedure nor a clinical finding/result, and it is more specific than generic Radiology report concepts due to modality identification. The phrasing adds no new attributes that would shift coding to a child or sibling concept."
258361004,Catterall grading (qualifier value),Catterall grading per standard practice,"The entry conveys that grading follows the Catterall approach in general, without specifying a grade. As a Qualifier value, the correct code is Catterall grading (qualifier value) [258361004]. Child grade-level codes require a grade reference; parents like general grading or other systems are not suggested. No additional attributes (e.g., laterality, severity) are included."
236292001,Repair of ruptured bulbar urethra (procedure),Urethral rupture repair—bulbar segment,"States a repair of urethral rupture, explicitly constrained to the bulbar segment. Attributes: repair action, morphology (rupture), site (bulbar segment of urethra). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The bulbar site makes this an exact match for SCTID 236292001. Broader urethral repair codes lack site specificity, and method-specific repairs (e.g., anastomotic) are not indicated. Other segment-specific siblings would be incorrect because bulbar is clearly specified."
1144611009,Product containing iodinated contrast media (product),Pharmacy formulary: iodinated contrast agent product,"The formulary context still targets a product concept: an iodinated contrast agent product, which aligns with SNOMED CT 1144611009 (Product). It avoids specifying brand, ingredient (e.g., iohexol), ionic character, or dose form attributes, so child concepts are not more appropriate. The iodine qualifier distinguishes it from parent contrast products and non-iodinated sibling products."
257645006,Mountain resort (environment),Mountain holiday resort,"The entry identifies the environmental setting as a resort in the mountains; the term holiday merely reflects typical use of resorts and does not add timing or causation within coding context. Category: Environment or geographical location. It aligns with Mountain resort (environment) SCTID: 257645006. Parent concepts like Resort are too broad, and activity-specific children (e.g., ski resort) would be inaccurate because no specific activity is mentioned."
215429004,"Submersion or drowning due to boat submerging, occupant of small powered boat injured (event)","Occupant injured when small powerboat submerged, causing drowning/submersion.",The entry connects the submerging of a small powered boat with a drowning/submersion event and an injured occupant. Category: Event. SCTID 215429004 is the most precise code because it includes both the external cause (boat submerging) and the specific context (occupant of a small powered boat). Parent or sibling concepts lacking either element would be less accurate.
397078009,Specimen obtained by excisional biopsy (specimen),Diagnostic specimen obtained via excisional biopsy,"The entry designates a diagnostic specimen and specifies the acquisition method as excisional biopsy; 'diagnostic' reflects typical intent but does not alter the specimen type. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This maps to 397078009 because the specimen is defined by being obtained through excisional biopsy. A parent concept would be overly broad, and siblings involving different biopsy techniques would not match. It does not describe the procedure, so procedure coding is inappropriate."
257802002,Anterior displacement (qualifier value),Report: anterior displacement,"As a reporting statement, it specifies the attribute of displacement oriented anteriorly without naming structures or additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 257802002 matches exactly by describing anterior displacement. Parent concepts without direction are not precise enough, and sibling directional concepts are inappropriate. The syntax change (“Report:”) does not affect code selection."
242315001,Accidental ingestion of carnelian cherry berries (event),Accidental ingestion of cornelian cherry berries.,"This phrasing specifies accidental ingestion and uses “cornelian cherry” as a recognized variant spelling for the same plant species, with the ingested form being berries. No added attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and SCTID 242315001 is the exact match. Parent concepts that omit the plant (e.g., accidental ingestion of berries) are less precise, and sibling concepts concerning other plant species are incorrect. The synonym “cornelian” is clinically equivalent to “carnelian,” not altering code selection."
714735004,Eye dropper bottle aid (physical object),Eye dropper bottle attachment aid,"This describes an aid that attaches to an eye dropper bottle, clearly a physical object accessory for the bottle. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It maps to SCTID 714735004 since it denotes a bottle-specific aid; parent device categories lack specificity, and sibling devices like non-attachment instillation aids or separate applicators would not reflect a bottle attachment aid."
214642000,Accident with breakage of part of motor-driven snow vehicle (event),Accident resulted in breakage of part of motor-driven snow vehicle,"The phrase conveys an accident event with the outcome of a broken part on a motor-driven snow vehicle, matching SNOMED CT 214642000 (Event). “Resulted in breakage” is consistent with the concept’s defining attribute and does not add extraneous cause details. Parent accident/event codes lack the specificity of the broken part and vehicle type; siblings/children that specify mechanism, injuries, or different vehicles are not indicated. The most precise mapping is 214642000."
466504000,Water heating/cooling pad system pad (physical object),Nursing equipment: circulating-water thermal control system pad,"This nursing equipment entry identifies the pad belonging to a circulating-water thermal control system, maintaining focus on the pad as a physical object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 466504000 is appropriate because it specifies the water heating/cooling system pad, not a generic pad or the system’s control unit. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings like hydrocollator packs or electric heating pads differ in modality. 'Thermal control' communicates bidirectional temperature capability equivalent to heating/cooling."
389247007,Genus Chironax (organism),Chironax (taxonomy genus),"This entry frames Chironax as a genus in taxonomic terms, which is an organism concept at the genus rank. It does not introduce any finer classification such as species, nor any broader grouping, keeping the scope aligned with 'Genus Chironax (organism).' The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 389247007 is the exact match. The 'taxonomy genus' phrasing is synonymic and does not alter code choice."
1204481007,"Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (geographic location)","Referral sent to Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha","This reflects administrative context while the codable entity remains the geographic location named. The concept is a Geographic location. The exact SNOMED CT concept is 'Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (geographic location)' [1204481007]. A parent (broader region) or children (individual islands) do not fit because the phrase asserts the combined official territorial name."
473171009,History of vaginal hysterectomy (situation),Patient states she had her uterus removed through the vagina.,"This patient-reported statement describes a past hysterectomy and specifies the vaginal route (“through the vagina”), establishing historical context and approach. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 473171009 is the most accurate match for history of vaginal hysterectomy. A parent like “History of hysterectomy” lacks route specificity, and other approach-based siblings would be incorrect. The lay phrasing is clinically equivalent and does not add extent or indications."
306595003,Discharge from neurology service (procedure),Discharge confirmed from neurology service,"The entry confirms that the discharge from neurology service occurred, which is the same procedure as the concept. Category: Procedure. SCTID 306595003 is the correct code due to the specialty service (neurology) and the discharge action being explicitly stated. Parent or generic discharge codes would be less specific, and discharges from other services would be incorrect. 'Confirmed' does not add clinical attributes; it only affirms the procedure happened."
765422000,Product containing beta-lactam (product),Beta-lactam-containing product,"This entry is a direct synonymical reordering that still identifies a product whose ingredient content includes a beta-lactam, and it does not introduce agent specifics, route, dose, or combinations. It belongs to the Pharmaceutical/biologic product hierarchy and corresponds precisely to SCTID 765422000. Selecting a parent concept such as Medicinal product would lose the ingredient specificity, and selecting a child like Product containing carbapenem or cephalosporin would assume a particular subclass not stated. It also avoids substance-only or therapeutic-intent terms, keeping it as a product concept."
170894006,Ear nose and throat disease treatment stopped (situation),Record notes: ENT disease treatment stopped.,"This documentation note records that treatment for an ENT disease has been stopped, indicating cessation with ENT context. It is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 170894006 is the most precise match because it captures the combination of ENT disease and treatment stoppage. The documentation context does not alter the clinical meaning or introduce new attributes. Parent concepts such as unspecified treatment stoppage are too broad, and siblings like “ENT therapy interrupted” or “ENT care refused” depict different statuses or actions not stated here."
702843005,Congestive heart failure clinic (environment),Care setting: congestive heart failure clinic,"Framed as a care-setting header, this entry still names a specific clinic environment focused on congestive heart failure. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographic location, and Congestive heart failure clinic (environment) SCTID 702843005 is the precise match. Mapping to broader environments like cardiac clinic or heart failure clinic would lose the congestive specificity, and mapping to service processes would be incorrect because the phrase defines location, not an action."
310334003,Cremation certificate (record artifact),Proof of cremation certificate,"This phrase characterizes the certificate as proof of cremation, which is the intended role of the artifact; it remains the same document. No status, timing, or subject attributes are included. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 310334003 represents the specific certificate. Parent categories are too general, and sibling artifacts (authorization, permit) differ materially. The wording is a descriptive synonym preserving the artifact identity."
722216001,Emergency medical identification record (record artifact),Emergency medical identification record presented,"The entry refers to the specific artifact being presented, which is an emergency medical identification record. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 722216001 is appropriate because it denotes the exact type of record; the verb “presented” is a contextual action and does not alter the artifact type. Parent concepts are overly broad, and children or siblings like emergency department notes or alert devices are not implied. The content remains limited to the identification record itself."
715392006,30 item General Health Questionnaire score (observable entity),GHQ-30 score,"The entry explicitly refers to the score derived from the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30). This is an Observable entity because it represents a measurable psychometric result rather than a disorder or finding. The most precise SNOMED CT match is 30 item General Health Questionnaire score (observable entity) [715392006], as it identifies the instrument and item count. Broader parent concepts like General Health Questionnaire score lack the 30-item specification, and sibling concepts for GHQ-12 or GHQ-28 are incorrect. The concise phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not introduce additional attributes such as value, interpretation, or timing."
737436002,Hypoglycemia self management plan (record artifact),Hypoglycemia self-treatment plan document,"The phrase clearly indicates a documented plan for self-directed treatment actions related to hypoglycemia, pointing to a plan record artifact rather than a clinical event. ""Self-treatment"" functions as a synonym for self-management in this context without introducing new attributes. SCTID 737436002 fits exactly. Parent-level plans (e.g., general treatment plans) lack the hypoglycemia focus, and sibling concepts such as educational leaflets or provider protocols would be outside the self-management plan scope."
508007,Eranthis hyemalis (organism),Eranthis hyemalis (taxonomic entry),"The entry signals a taxonomic listing for Eranthis hyemalis, which directly names the species organism. No further attributes appear. Category: Organism. The code SCTID 508007 is the precise match. Parent-level taxa would be too general, and no indication of sibling species or child varieties is present, so the species-level organism concept is correctly selected."
223505006,Subcontinent (geographic location),Subcontinent (geographic location),"This entry explicitly identifies the class as a geographic location and names the type “subcontinent,” aligning precisely with Subcontinent (geographic location). Category: Location (Geographic location). The wording specifically matches the concept label, without introducing any region names or contextual attributes. A parent like “Geographic location” is less precise, and sibling terms (continent, country, island) describe different geographic forms, making them less suitable."
444486008,Exposure to Hepatitis B virus (event),Exposure to hepatitis B virus,"The main concept documented is exposure to the hepatitis B virus, without any added qualifiers about route, severity, timing, or outcomes. This aligns directly with SNOMED CT 444486008, which is classified under the Event hierarchy. It is the most precise match because it specifies exposure to HBV, not merely exposure to a bloodborne pathogen or viral hepatitis generally (which would be broader parent concepts), nor a specific route like needlestick (which would be a more specific child concept). The phrase is the preferred term and does not imply infection or prophylaxis, avoiding sibling concepts such as hepatitis B infection."
1290909009,Non-powered steam inhaler (physical object),Passive steam inhaler,"Describing the device as ‘passive’ conveys that it does not use an active power source, aligning with non-powered operation, and ‘steam inhaler’ specifies the device function. The concept is a passive (non-powered) steam inhaler. Category: Physical object (device). This matches SCTID 1290909009 because it differentiates from the generic steam inhaler parent by the non-powered attribute and excludes powered variants. It is not a general inhaler or humidifier, maintaining specificity to steam inhalation."
130729007,Ophiolysin (substance),Ophiolysin recorded,"This documentation phrase indicates that 'ophiolysin' is the recorded substance, which maps directly to Ophiolysin (substance) SCTID 130729007 within the Substance hierarchy. It avoids any additional clinical attributes (e.g., dose, exposure, effect), making parent or sibling concepts inappropriate. The entry is a straightforward reference to the substance itself."
371529009,History and physical report (record artifact),H and P report,"Spelling out the abbreviation with 'H and P' maintains the same meaning: a history and physical report. The main concept is the document containing both history and physical examination content, placing it in the Record artifact category. The specific SNOMED CT match is History and physical report (record artifact). Broader report artifacts are less specific, and documents like Discharge summary or Operative report are different siblings. This does not refer to the act of examination, avoiding mapping to a procedure concept."
1184595009,Present problem document section (record artifact),Present problem section in the progress note,"This entry specifies that the progress note contains a section titled “Present problem,” which is a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 1184595009 is the accurate code because it denotes the present problem document section precisely. Using a broader parent would reduce specificity, and sibling sections like “Chief complaint” or “Problem list” are not indicated by the text. The mention of a progress note is contextual and does not add clinical attributes."
421441001,South Carolina (geographic location),South Carolina (United States),"This variant places the state in its national context without altering the intended concept, which is the geographic location of South Carolina. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). It maps to SCTID 421441001. Parent country or sibling states would not be as precise, and child locales within the state are not referenced. The parenthetical is a neutral clarifier, not an attribute that changes coding."
446059004,Work ability index score (observable entity),Work Ability Index score entered in chart,"This documentation-focused entry names the WAI score as the item entered, maintaining emphasis on the observable entity. It does not include values, timing beyond charting, or categorical labels. SCTID 446059004 is the correct match. Parent concepts (generic score) and procedural or categorized siblings do not reflect the precise wording."
725117008,Family history of hyperlipidemia (situation),Reported family history of hyperlipidemia.,"The entry indicates that the patient has reported a family history of hyperlipidemia, maintaining the familial context. This is a Situation with explicit context and aligns with SNOMED CT 725117008. Parent-level family history concepts are overly broad, while sibling concepts like personal history of hyperlipidemia or risk due to family history would misrepresent the context. ‘Reported’ does not alter the clinical meaning and remains a precise match."
37861000087104,Thermoascus verrucosus (organism),Thermoascus verrucosus (species record),"The phrase indicates a record for the species Thermoascus verrucosus, with no supplementary attributes or clinical claims. This is an Organism concept in SNOMED CT at the species granularity. Mapping to a parent genus or higher taxon would lose specificity, while sibling species would be incorrect. The ‘species record’ wording is a context indicator that maintains alignment with the species-level organism concept."
286587001,International System of Units unit of mass per calorific quantity (qualifier value),Specify units as SI mass per calorific quantity,"The instruction sets the unit specification to the SI class of mass per calorific quantity without naming a particular unit. This is a Qualifier value concept, and SCTID 286587001 represents the exact class. General SI units are too broad, while naming a concrete unit would select a child. The entry’s explicit calorific quantity denominator prevents misclassification into other mass-per-X sibling categories."
773977004,Hepatology care plan (record artifact),History lists hepatology care plan,"This phrasing notes that the patient’s history lists a hepatology care plan, focusing on the existence of that record artifact. It avoids adding attributes like condition, severity, or timing. The category is Record artifact. Hepatology care plan (record artifact) [773977004] is the most precise code because the artifact is specialty-specific. Parent concepts lacking the hepatology qualifier and siblings tied to other specialties or specific liver conditions would be less appropriate."
723394009,Photographic image record (record artifact),Picture record (photographic),"This entry uses “picture” clarified as photographic and identifies it as a record, which fits the photographic image record artifact (723394009). The core concept is a photograph in the record; no clinical attributes are added. Category: Record artifact. A parent artifact term would be too general, and sibling artifacts such as video or scanned documents are excluded by “photographic.” “Picture” is a lay synonym for “photograph,” and the qualifier and record context maintain equivalence to the intended SNOMED concept."
15625411000119109,Long-term current use of apremilast (situation),Ongoing long-term apremilast regimen,"The phrase describes an apremilast regimen that is both ongoing (current) and long-term, with no additional clinical attributes included. Main concept: long-term current use of apremilast. Category: Situation. This precisely selects SCTID 15625411000119109, focusing on continued long-term therapy with this drug. Generic long-term medication use would be too broad, and sibling concepts naming other drugs would be inaccurate. “Regimen” is a neutral term for structured use and does not alter the coding."
722270004,"Blood pressure cuff inflator, electronic (physical object)",Electronic blood pressure cuff inflator,"This phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym of the preferred term, specifying the electronic inflator used to pressurize a blood pressure cuff. The main concept is the electronic inflator, and the explicit attribute is that it is electronic. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It fits SCTID 722270004 precisely because it denotes the inflator element without measurement capabilities. It is not a parent (general BP device) nor a child/sibling like a manual bulb or a full monitor; the synonym does not add measurement or other functions."
4321000179101,Hematology report (record artifact),Hematology laboratory report,"This phrasing specifies a laboratory report pertaining to hematology, clearly identifying a record artifact documenting hematology-related lab work. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It matches Hematology report (record artifact) [SCTID: 4321000179101] because the domain is hematology and the artifact is a report. It is not merely results or an observation, nor does it specify particular hematology subtests, avoiding children like CBC report. It is more specific than the parent Laboratory report."
358392001,Solvent+detergent treated Frozen Human Plasma intravenous solution (product),Transfusion: S/D treated frozen human plasma (IV),"Main concept: transfusion record of solvent/detergent treated frozen human plasma, IV route. Attributes: S/D treatment, frozen human plasma, IV, product. SNOMED CT category: Product. The entry denotes the exact product used during transfusion, corresponding to SCTID 358392001. A parent concept like “frozen plasma” lacks the S/D detail, and siblings such as “thawed plasma” or different pathogen-reduction technologies would be mismatches. The phrasing is equivalent and maintains the same concept."
551101000124107,Referral to lawyer (procedure),Referral provided to attorney.,"The concept is the act of providing a referral to an attorney (lawyer). This falls under Procedure and is best coded as “Referral to lawyer (procedure)” SCTID 551101000124107. It does not include cause, timing, or subtype attributes. More general referral codes or other professional targets are less appropriate, as the entry specifically names the legal professional. Using 'attorney' is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not change the mapping."
258787002,megajoule (qualifier value),Document energy in megajoule,"This entry instructs documentation to use the megajoule unit. The main concept is the energy unit; there are no amounts or clinical qualifiers. It is a Qualifier value and maps to megajoule (qualifier value) SCTID 258787002. A parent energy unit is too broad, and siblings such as joule or kilojoule denote different magnitudes, so they are less precise. The phrasing is a direct unit specification."
396308005,Myometrial invasion by tumor present (finding),Report indicates presence of tumor invasion into myometrium,"This entry states that the finding of tumor invasion into the myometrium is present, aligning with 'Myometrial invasion by tumor present' (396308005), categorized as a Clinical finding. The reporting context does not alter the core semantics; no depth, percentage, or stage is added. Parent concepts lacking site specificity are too broad, and child concepts that refine invasion extent are not expressed. Siblings for absent invasion or alternative uterine sites would not match the confirmed presence."
12280006,"Blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, function (observable entity)",Lab requisition: blood–CSF barrier function,"This text reflects ordering or documentation context but points to the same observable—the function of the blood–CSF barrier. No additional attributes are introduced. It belongs to the Observable entity category and maps to SNOMED CT 12280006. Using a parent observable would be nonspecific, while siblings such as BBB function are not referenced. The absence of abnormal qualifiers avoids misclassification as a finding."
701608005,Custom-made bioabsorbable biliary stent (physical object),Custom-engineered absorbable biliary stent,"The entry identifies a biliary stent that is custom-engineered (custom-made) and absorbable (bioabsorbable in medical device usage). The category is Physical object. It best matches SCTID 701608005 because it includes both the customization and bioabsorbability attributes on a biliary stent. More general device parents, or siblings such as nonabsorbable custom biliary stents, do not fit the stated characteristics. No mention of placement or clinical presence is made."
61734008,Terebrospina (organism),Taxon recorded as Terebrospina,"The entry denotes a taxonomic recording of the organism name Terebrospina, matching Terebrospina (organism), SCTID 61734008. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. 'Taxon' is a neutral synonym indicating a biological classification and does not add clinical attributes such as disease or subtype. This is more specific than parent organism categories and does not imply any particular child species."
405439001,Revision of amputation of hallux (procedure),Foot surgery entry: Revision of first toe amputation,"This entry records the procedure concept of revising an amputation of the first toe, i.e., hallux. It does not add extra clinical attributes. Category: Procedure. SCTID 405439001 is the correct, specific code for revision of hallux amputation. Parent concepts lacking digit specificity or sibling procedures like re-amputation are not indicated. “First toe” is anatomically equivalent to hallux and keeps coding intent unchanged."
181677008,Entire short external rotator of hip joint (body structure),Hip short external rotators (entire structure),"The entry refers to the collective short external rotator muscles at the hip and explicitly frames this as the entire structure. It does not imply side, disease, or any procedural context. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 181677008 is the most precise match, reflecting the complete group, unlike a parent concept that covers all hip muscles or child concepts that describe one specific rotator. The synonymy between 'short external rotators' and the preferred term is clinically standard and does not change code selection."
288687004,Difficulty presupposing in conversation (finding),Difficulty presupposing in conversation,"The sole concept expressed is difficulty presupposing in conversation, which refers to a pragmatic communication finding where the individual struggles to assume or manage shared background information during dialogue. This is a Clinical finding and matches SNOMED CT 288687004 exactly. Broader parent notions like general conversational difficulty or pragmatic language disorder would be less precise, and siblings such as difficulty with turn‑taking or topic maintenance describe different pragmatic domains. The wording maps directly without adding severity, cause, timing, or other attributes."
44907005,"Four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle, device (physical object)",Quad ATV (four-wheeled),"This entry uses “Quad” (implying four wheels) and explicitly reiterates “four-wheeled,” combined with “ATV,” to denote the device consistent with SNOMED CT 44907005. The category is Physical object (Device). It avoids mapping to the broader ATV parent by specifying wheel count, and it excludes siblings like three-wheel ATVs. No additional attributes or features are mentioned."
462440003,Phorometer (physical object),Phorometer,"The entry explicitly names the device 'Phorometer', which is a physical instrument used to measure ocular phoria. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the most precise match is Phorometer (physical object), SCTID 462440003. This does not imply any procedure or broader class of ophthalmic devices, so parent concepts like 'Ophthalmic measuring device' are too general, and sibling devices such as 'Phoropter' or 'Maddox rod' are incorrect. The term exactly corresponds to the intended device without adding attributes."
57843004,Hemoglobin Okayama (substance),Patient paperwork mentions Hemoglobin Okayama,"This narrative context cites the substance name without asserting any clinical state, keeping the core concept as Hemoglobin Okayama. The category is Substance, and the appropriate code is SCTID 57843004. The wording does not introduce diagnosis, trait, or presence attributes; it merely references the molecule’s name. A parent concept would be too general, and sibling variants would not match the explicit named substance."
66456009,Amnioscopy (procedure),Amnioscopy—inspection of amniotic fluid,"The entry identifies amnioscopy and clarifies its purpose as inspection of amniotic fluid, consistent with the procedure’s definition. It is a Procedure concept, and Amnioscopy (procedure), SCTID 66456009, is the exact match. The phrase does not introduce extraneous attributes such as timing or severity. More general parents (endoscopy) lack specificity, and sibling procedures (fetoscopy, amniocentesis) differ in technique and target. Thus, the procedure code for amnioscopy is appropriate."
258652006,Ice cream specimen (specimen),Ice cream test sample,"The entry identifies the sample as ice cream with 'test' indicating use context; the specimen type remains unchanged. The category is Specimen and SCTID 258652006 matches. General parents (e.g., food sample) lack the specificity provided by 'ice cream,' and no child subtype is implied, ensuring the precise ice cream specimen concept is selected."
114800000,"Salmonella II 42:l,v:e,n,x,z15 (organism)","Organism code: Salmonella II 42:l,v:e,n,x,z15","The phrase denotes the organism by its precise name, Salmonella II 42:l,v:e,n,x,z15; mentioning 'Organism code' is contextual and does not add clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact name maps to SCTID 114800000. Parent concepts would be overly general, and sibling serovars with different antigenic components would be wrong. Therefore, the specific organism concept is the most accurate and precise match for this entry."
1380059001,Union for International Cancer Control aTis(LAMN) (qualifier value),Cancer registry entry: UICC aTis (LAMN),"This registry notation captures the UICC autopsy Tis designation for LAMN, i.e., UICC aTis(LAMN). The concept is a Qualifier value, precisely SCTID 1380059001. It avoids generic UICC aTis without LAMN and excludes other prefixes or systems, so parent or sibling codes would be less accurate. The registry context does not change the qualifier’s meaning and is semantically equivalent."
270102001,Report for Coroner (record artifact),Report for coroner documented,"The entry indicates that a report intended for the coroner has been documented, preserving the artifact’s identity and recipient. The main concept is the report-for-coroner document. Category: Record artifact. “Documented” conveys presence without introducing timing or clinical data. It is not a coroner-produced report or a different legal document, so the precise match is SCTID 270102001 rather than a broader or sibling concept."
720617006,Bone structure of left clavicle (body structure),Left clavicle osseous component,"“Osseous component” explicitly refers to the bone of the left clavicle, not soft tissue or joint structures. The category is Body structure. This precisely matches SNOMED 720617006. Parent concepts without laterality, right-side siblings, and child structures of the clavicle are all less appropriate to the wording."
468538003,Electrocardiographic lead switching adaptor (physical object),Electrocardiograph lead switch adaptor,"Using 'electrocardiograph' references the ECG apparatus, and 'lead switch adaptor' conveys the specific adaptor that switches leads. The main concept is a device; no additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This maps directly to SCTID 468538003 because it specifies an adaptor for switching ECG leads. Other device concepts like electrodes, cables, or monitors are not implied. The phrasing is a clinically acceptable synonym and does not alter code selection."
1365704000,History of victim of domestic violence (situation),Radiology requisition history: victim of domestic violence (prior),"Including 'history' and 'prior' makes it clear the domestic violence victim status is past, often used in imaging requisitions for context. This fits the Situation category and maps to SCTID 1365704000. Coding as a current finding or specifying intimate partner violence would add detail not present. The wording does not introduce injuries or other attributes, keeping it aligned with the exact concept."
12595009,Structure of sartorius muscle (body structure),Sartorius m. (body structure),"Using the common abbreviation 'm.' for muscle, the entry explicitly denotes the sartorius muscle as a body structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This is a clinically equivalent synonym and maps to Structure of sartorius muscle (SCTID 12595009). Broader or sibling muscle structures are not implicated, and no additional attributes such as laterality or function are introduced. Thus, the exact anatomical concept is selected."
773594006,Orthodontic care plan (record artifact),Orthodontic care plan record artifact,"The entry explicitly labels the item as a record artifact and specifies the orthodontic care plan domain. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It corresponds exactly to Orthodontic care plan (773594006). Broader or sibling artifacts, such as general care plan or dental care plan, are less specific, and procedural or referral concepts are not applicable because this refers to the documented plan itself."
703691002,Spun cerebrospinal fluid (specimen),CSF sample (centrifuged),"The entry specifies CSF as a sample and explicitly indicates centrifugation; ‘centrifuged’ equals ‘spun’ clinically. Main concept: centrifuged CSF specimen; category: Specimen. SCTID 703691002 is the exact representation, while the parent ‘CSF specimen’ misses the processing attribute. Siblings specifying supernatant or pellet are not implied here and would be incorrect. Use of ‘sample’ is an accepted synonym for specimen and does not add attributes."
361333002,Entire convoluted renal tubule (body structure),Entire convoluted tubule (kidney),"The entry specifies the whole convoluted tubule of the kidney, which is semantically equivalent to the preferred term. There are no attributes beyond structure identity. As a Body structure, it maps to SNOMED CT 361333002. A broader parent like “renal tubule” lacks the convoluted qualifier, and children such as proximal/distal convoluted tubule are not appropriate because the entry does not indicate those subsegments. Parent/sibling concepts are therefore less precise."
26216008,Central (qualifier value),Central site,"This indicates the site is central without specifying a particular anatomical structure. The main concept is the positional qualifier 'central'. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It fits 26216008 precisely. More generic parent qualifiers are less specific, and siblings like 'peripheral' or 'medial' are not conveyed. 'Site' here simply contextualizes the qualifier without altering its meaning."
215760003,"Localized fire in watercraft, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)",Discharge summary (event): localized fire in watercraft with injury to small unpowered boat occupant,The discharge summary entry conveys the localized watercraft fire and the injured status of the small unpowered boat occupant. Category: Event. It aligns with SCTID 215760003 as it captures both necessary attributes without extra details. Parent concepts that are less specific or sibling concepts with different boat power status or occupant types are not as appropriate. The wording uses clinically equivalent terms without altering the meaning.
770575000,Endobronchial ultrasound report (record artifact),Endobronchial ultrasound scan report,"The word ‘scan’ here is a common synonym for an ultrasound examination in clinical documentation, and the entry refers to the report artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and Endobronchial ultrasound report (770575000) is the precise concept. Broader or sibling concepts (e.g., thoracic ultrasound report, bronchoscopy report) do not capture the endobronchial ultrasound modality. The entry avoids content such as interpretations or outcomes that would suggest child artifacts."
289914009,Structure of distopalatal surface of tooth root (body structure),Palatal-distal root surface of a tooth,"The phrase 'palatal-distal' is a clinically equivalent orientation descriptor for 'distopalatal,' applied to the root surface of a tooth. No extra attributes are introduced. This anatomical reference is a Body structure and aligns with SCTID 289914009. A parent like 'tooth root surface' is less specific, and siblings that are 'distobuccal' or 'mesiopalatal' represent different surface orientations and would be inaccurate here."
165357005,Test result to patient by telephone (situation),Patient received test result by telephone,"Main concept: the patient received a test result through a telephone call. Attributes: test result content, patient recipient, telephone method. SNOMED CT category: Situation. This aligns exactly with 165357005 by specifying the situation of result delivery via telephone to the patient. Parent concepts lacking method or sibling concepts with other methods would be less specific. 'Received' reflects the patient-side perspective of the same communication event, maintaining equivalence."
1268440002,Distance of Merkel cell carcinoma from closest deep surgical margin in excised specimen of skin (observable entity),Follow-up note: documenting MCC distance from the closest deep surgical margin in skin excision,"This follow-up documentation references the observable measurement of MCC distance from the closest deep surgical margin in a skin excision specimen. Concepts: MCC, deep surgical margin, closest/minimum distance, excised skin specimen. Category: Observable entity. It does not suggest peripheral margin evaluation or margin status and is more precise than generic tumor margin distances. The wording is a context-specific restatement matching SCTID 1268440002."
335301008,Elastomer and viscose bandage (physical object),Elastomer and viscose bandage,"The phrase specifies the physical object: a bandage manufactured from elastomer and viscose materials. The main concept is the bandage’s material-defined type; no additional attributes (size, adhesive, sterile status, body site, timing) are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with a Physical object category. It matches precisely the concept “Elastomer and viscose bandage,” avoiding broader parents like generic “Bandage (physical object)” or siblings such as “Elastic bandage,” “Adhesive bandage,” or material-specific alternatives. Because the wording exactly mirrors the FSN, 335301008 is the most specific and correct code."
309313009,Lamellar bone tissue structure (body structure),Bone tissue—lamellar,"This entry names the tissue domain (bone) and the specific subtype (lamellar), pointing directly to the anatomical structure Lamellar bone tissue (309313009). It remains structural, not a finding or disease, and does not specify location or microarchitecture beyond lamellae, making parents too general and children/siblings (cortical, trabecular, woven) either overly specific or different types."
224666007,Bus converted to mobile home (environment),Resides in bus-home (bus converted to mobile home),"The entry states the individual resides in a bus-home, clarified as a bus converted to a mobile home, which directly aligns with “Bus converted to mobile home (environment)” (224666007). The main concept is an environmental housing context. Category: Environment or geographical location. The explicit linkage to a bus conversion prevents mapping to general mobile home or to siblings such as motorhomes that are not conversions of buses. The phrasing introduces no additional attributes, and the synonym “bus-home” is clarified to be clinically equivalent to the intended concept."
439142009,History of recurrent tonsillitis (situation),Past medical history: recurrent tonsillitis,"The phrase clearly places recurrent tonsillitis in the past medical history, retaining the recurrence qualifier and not introducing other attributes. This is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 439142009 best matches because it encodes a history of the recurrent condition. Broader or sibling concepts such as History of tonsillitis (unspecified recurrence) are less precise, and an active disorder code would not be appropriate because the context is historical."
4951000175104,Does use written communication (finding),Written form is used for communication,"This phrasing indicates that the written form is used for communication, matching the Clinical finding Does use written communication (SCTID: 4951000175104). It expresses positive use without adding preference, timing, cause, or degree. Codes for non-use, ability, or other communication forms would not fit the clear written modality specified."
421782002,Astigmatic dial (physical object),Astigmatic dial chart available in exam room,"This inventory-style statement identifies the object and its presence, without introducing differing attributes. Category: Physical object. It maps to 421782002 because the specific chart is named. A broader 'exam room equipment' parent would be nonspecific; sibling charts (Snellen, Lea) are different objects and not indicated here."
223737009,Andaman islands (geographic location),Andamans,"This entry uses the commonly accepted shorthand 'Andamans' to refer to the Andaman Islands as a group, without adding any attributes. It maps to SNOMED CT Andaman islands (geographic location), SCTID 223737009, within the Geographic location category. It does not imply the Andaman Sea or the broader Andaman and Nicobar territory, nor any specific island subset, making parent or child concepts less appropriate. The synonym is clinically equivalent, preserving the intended geographic entity."
328707001,Gluten-free lasagne (product),Diet order item — gluten-free lasagne,"This entry designates the diet order item as gluten-free lasagne, keeping the focus on the food product. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Product, with the precise match being Gluten-free lasagne (SCTID 328707001). The phrase does not introduce attributes such as portion size, brand, or preparation method, so parents (generic lasagne or gluten-free food) and siblings (other gluten-free pasta dishes) are less suitable. The contextual reference to an order does not alter the product code selection."
54787006,Shellfish (organism),Shellfish biological organism,"This phrase clarifies biological nature and directly labels shellfish as an organism, without adding clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the correct code is Shellfish (organism) [54787006]. Using a parent Organism concept would be too broad, and using specific taxa would be too narrow. There is no implication of food item or allergic reaction, making other branches inappropriate."
66953006,Ascaris (organism),Target organism: Ascaris,"The context designates Ascaris as the target organism (e.g., for assay or educational focus), referencing the genus without claiming infection or result. The concept falls under Organism, precisely matching 66953006 Ascaris (organism). No species detail or clinical condition is introduced, so neither species children nor disorder concepts apply."
109030001,Product containing selective estrogen receptor modulator (product),SERM-containing pharmaceutical product,"This entry uses the common acronym SERM to denote selective estrogen receptor modulators and explicitly refers to a pharmaceutical product that contains one. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Using 'SERM' is a clinically accepted synonym for selective estrogen receptor modulator and does not change the code selection. Parent or sibling concepts would be less accurate, as we are not describing a non-selective modulator or a substance-only concept, and child concepts naming specific agents (e.g., tamoxifen) would be overly specific."
171866006,Neurostimulation of peripheral nerve (procedure),Peripheral nerve stimulation carried out,"The entry records that stimulation of a peripheral nerve was carried out, which directly corresponds to Neurostimulation of peripheral nerve (SCTID 171866006) in the Procedure category. It avoids adding attributes such as the route, device, or specific nerve identity, thereby not mapping to child concepts like percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation or named nerve stimulation. Parent concepts that do not specify peripheral nerves are less appropriate. The wording is a straightforward procedural statement that is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
218208005,Overexposure to lasers (event),Safety report: laser overexposure,"This conveys that a safety report documents an event of laser overexposure. The core medical concept remains overexposure to lasers, an Event. The report context does not alter or add clinical attributes like injury or timing; it simply indicates documentation. General exposure or radiation concepts would be too broad, and injury-related codes would add outcomes not present. The best match is SNOMED CT 218208005."
212572003,Always eating (finding),Constant eating behavior.,"This phrasing explicitly labels the behavior (eating) as constant, which remains a Clinical finding and maps to SNOMED CT 212572003 (Always eating). It does not specify appetite increase, compulsivity, or episodic binges. Hence, parent categories (general eating behavior findings) are too broad, and siblings like hyperphagia or compulsive eating add attributes not present. The inclusion of “behavior” clarifies the domain without altering the coded concept."
262473007,Portlandvere (qualifier value),Selected descriptor: Portlandvere,"This documents Portlandvere as the chosen descriptor, operating as a Qualifier value. It avoids any implication of clinical severity, temporality, or causation. Therefore, the correct SNOMED CT mapping is Portlandvere (qualifier value) 262473007 rather than a more general or alternative qualifier concept."
310461002,Supraclavicular approach (qualifier value),Access: supraclavicular,"This concise entry defines the procedural access, i.e., approach, as supraclavicular, with no extra attributes like laterality or target. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the exact match is Supraclavicular approach [310461002]. A generic parent access/approach qualifier would be less precise, and sibling approaches are not indicated. 'Access' is a conventional synonym for approach in procedural documentation and preserves the same concept."
1279820007,American Joint Committee on Cancer rcN0a (qualifier value),Registry entry—AJCC rcN0a,"This registry context entry directly lists AJCC rcN0a, which denotes the recurrent clinical nodal subcategory N0a. It is a qualifier value and should map to SNOMED CT 1279820007. Parent categories like rcN0 without 'a' are less specific, and siblings such as rcN0b or rcN1 are incorrect. The context 'registry entry' does not add clinical attributes; it simply frames the qualifier usage."
223736000,Islands in region of India (geographic location),Documented locale is islands in region of India,"The term 'locale' here denotes the geographic location and is explicitly the islands within the Indian region. No timing, severity, or causality is introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This maps appropriately to SCTID 223736000 because it preserves the island feature within India’s region. Parent concepts like Region of India are too broad, and children naming specific islands are more specific than intended. Sibling region-based islands outside India would not match."
714976003,Entered into device clinical trial (finding),Joined a device clinical trial.,"The wording conveys that the patient has joined (i.e., entered/enrolled in) a device-oriented clinical trial, without adding extra details such as phase or allocation. This is a Clinical finding. “Joined” functions as a natural-language synonym for entry/enrollment and, with the explicit device qualifier, fits “Entered into device clinical trial (finding).” Generic clinical trial entry is too broad, and drug trial entry is incorrect for a device. The synonym does not change the intended concept."
408405001,Patient held diabetic record issued (record artifact),Discharge note—patient-held diabetes record issued,"In the discharge context, this entry shows issuance of a patient-held diabetes record. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The statement preserves the core concept of issuing a patient-held diabetic record and does not add attributes beyond context. SCTID 408405001 is the appropriate code. Using a generic patient-held record issuance would be less specific, and other condition-specific patient-held records would not correspond to the diabetes qualifier present."
40880001,Structure of lingual vein (body structure),Lingual vein,"The entry explicitly names the anatomical vessel 'lingual vein', which is a body structure of the tongue's venous system. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure (Anatomical structure). This wording matches SCTID 40880001 exactly, as it denotes the specific vein rather than any disease, procedure, or physiology. More general parents like 'vein of tongue' would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts such as 'deep lingual vein', 'dorsal lingual vein', or 'sublingual vein' are not specified here. No additional attributes (laterality, pathology, timing) are introduced, making this a precise match."
309954007,Hematology department (environment),Hematology Dept.,"The abbreviation 'Dept.' is a conventional synonym indicating 'department,' maintaining the environment meaning. The SNOMED category is 'Environment or geographical location.' This entry maps precisely to the hematology department environment (309954007). Broader parents such as 'Hospital department' are less specific, and siblings like 'Hematology clinic' or 'Hematology laboratory' introduce distinct sub-environments not stated. The abbreviation does not add attributes or change the intended setting."
213779002,Collision between railway vehicles followed by derailment (event),Collision between railway vehicles followed by derailment,"The entry explicitly names a collision between railway vehicles and specifies that derailment occurred afterward, which are the defining attributes of the SNOMED CT event concept. The category is Event. This matches SCTID 213779002 exactly and does not introduce timing, location, severity, or involvement attributes. Broader parents like general transport accidents or train derailment alone are insufficient because they omit either the inter-vehicle collision or the sequential derailment. Sibling concepts such as collision between railway vehicles without derailment or derailment without collision would be less precise given the wording."
258835005,Milligram/day (qualifier value),orderable unit: mg/day,"The entry designates mg/day as the orderable unit, i.e., milligrams per day, a Qualifier value for dosing rate. It precisely matches Milligram/day (258835005). It does not introduce numeric dose, substance, or frequency beyond the per-day denominator inherent to the unit, so generic mass units or different time-base siblings are inappropriate. The wording is context-specific yet unit-equivalent."
223902004,Surrey (geographic location),"Laboratory processed in Surrey, England",The main concept is Surrey in England as the geographic location; processing context is incidental. Category: Geographic location. This aligns with SNOMED CT 223902004. The England qualifier eliminates confusion with other places named Surrey. Broader parents (England) lack specificity; child concepts (specific towns or districts) are not identified. The wording is an acceptable synonymous reference to the same geographic entity.
704658004,Child at increased risk of neglect (finding),Risk of neglect increased in child,"This sentence communicates that a child's risk of neglect is increased, a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 704658004 is the precise code because it reflects age (child) and increased neglect risk. More general risk concepts or those covering adults would be less accurate, while siblings for confirmed neglect or abuse would miscode the intent. The rephrased structure is a semantic equivalent without adding attributes."
773441004,Hand surgery care plan (record artifact),Care coordination note: hand surgery care plan referenced,"Referencing the hand surgery care plan in a coordination context reflects the artifact guiding care. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The entry points to the plan-of-care document, not to a procedure or referral. Therefore, it precisely matches the hand surgery care plan artifact code and is more specific than a generic care plan parent."
117167005,"Kaolin induced coagulation, function (observable entity)",Kaolin-induced coagulation function,"The entry names the observable parameter specifically as kaolin-induced coagulation function, identifying the main concept: the functional assessment of coagulation when initiated by kaolin. No additional attributes (e.g., normal/abnormal, timing, severity) are stated. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Observable entity and aligns precisely with Kaolin induced coagulation, function (observable entity) SCTID 117167005. Choosing a parent like Coagulation function would be too general because it omits the kaolin activator, and any child/sibling that specifies different activators (e.g., tissue factor) or particular sub-parameters (e.g., R time, MA) would add attributes not present here. The wording is a direct match to the concept label."
16216131000119105,Specimen obtained from pouch of Douglas by aspiration (specimen),Specimen: aspiration from rectouterine cul-de-sac,This entry conveys a specimen obtained by aspiration from the rectouterine cul-de-sac (Douglas pouch). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 16216131000119105 because it specifies both site and method. It does not introduce unrelated attributes or suggest sibling concepts like lavage specimens or swab collections. The synonymous anatomy terms are clinically equivalent and maintain the same coding.
473387004,Never used contraception (situation),Has never used methods to prevent pregnancy,"By referencing 'methods to prevent pregnancy,' this entry uses a plain-language synonym for contraception and states lifetime nonuse. It aligns with the SNOMED CT Situation concept 'Never used contraception' (473387004). It is not a current-status or intent statement and does not name specific methods, avoiding child concept mappings. The synonym preserves equivalence without introducing new attributes."
379301000112102,Excision of neoplasm of pelvic cavity (procedure),"Documentation: pelvic cavity neoplasm, excision performed","The content documents that excision of a pelvic cavity neoplasm was performed, representing a Procedure. The phrasing includes no organ-specific detail, malignancy status, approach, or extent, keeping the concept aligned to SCTID 379301000112102. Parent concepts without the neoplasm attribute would be less specific, and child concepts that name specific organs (e.g., uterine tumor excision) would be over-specific. Sibling procedures such as biopsy or resection are not indicated, making excision of neoplasm of pelvic cavity the correct code."
223714003,Bolivia (geographic location),Bolivia,"The entry states the country name Bolivia, which directly corresponds to the SNOMED CT concept Bolivia (geographic location), SCTID 223714003. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). It denotes only the sovereign state and does not imply nationality, residence, travel, timing, or any sublocation. Therefore, it does not map to parent regions (e.g., South America) or child concepts such as cities or departments within Bolivia, nor to sibling countries. This is the most precise match for the geographic location of the country."
415929009,Estimated core body temperature measured in inguinal region (observable entity),"Inguinal site core temperature, estimated","The wording lists core temperature with the inguinal site and explicitly notes it is estimated, classifying this as an Observable entity. SCTID 415929009 is the precise code because it captures both the inguinal location and the estimation nature of the measurement. More general core temperature estimates without site or siblings representing non-estimated inguinal measurements do not match the exact phrasing. No method, laterality, or abnormality is implied."
3781000175109,Pediatric infectious disease service (qualifier value),Care service designation: pediatric infectious disease service,"This phrasing designates the care service as pediatric infectious disease, which is a service qualifier. Category: Qualifier value. The wording remains a service label, without introducing actions, settings, or personnel roles. Broader parents (general ID or pediatric services) would be less specific, and sibling constructs (clinic, specialist) are different. Therefore, it aligns precisely with Pediatric infectious disease service (3781000175109)."
55529002,Arylsulfatase B measurement (procedure),Laboratory measurement of arylsulfatase B,"By specifying a laboratory measurement of arylsulfatase B, this entry denotes the procedure of measuring ARSB and matches SCTID 55529002. The concept is the measurement procedure; it does not add any attributes such as specimen type, timing, or results. It is correctly classified as a Procedure because it describes a test action rather than an observed value or clinical condition. Parent concepts like unspecified laboratory enzyme measurement are too broad, and children that specify the matrix or method are not supported by the wording. The lab context does not change the meaning and remains equivalent to the preferred concept."
465573002,Transfemoral prosthesis socket (physical object),Patient-reported device: above-knee prosthetic socket,"Main concept: patient-referenced device is an above-knee prosthetic socket. Category: Physical object. Patient context does not modify the device; “above-knee prosthetic socket” is synonymous with transfemoral prosthesis socket, warranting code 465573002. The entry explicitly identifies the component and level, avoiding broader or different device concepts and adding no attributes."
213940000,Crushed by rolling stock - passenger (event),On-board passenger crushed by rolling stock,"The sentence states that an on-board passenger was crushed by rolling stock, which conveys the mechanism and role clearly, without adding extra qualifiers. In SNOMED CT this is an Event and maps to “Crushed by rolling stock - passenger (event)” (213940000). Using the parent “Crushed by rolling stock” would omit the passenger status, and siblings that specify different roles or mechanisms would misrepresent the statement. “On-board passenger” is a clinically equivalent way of indicating passenger status and does not change code selection."
223534000,Kenya (geographic location),Patient location: Kenya,"This entry sets the patient’s location value as Kenya, which is a geographic location at the national level. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location), and Kenya (geographic location), SCTID 223534000, is the exact match. The patient-location context does not alter the concept; it remains purely a place. Broader or narrower geographic entities would be less appropriate than the specific country."
24841000181105,Lysobacter ginsengisoli (organism),Final identification—Lysobacter ginsengisoli,"The entry indicates the final identified species as Lysobacter ginsengisoli, focusing on the organism’s name without additional attributes. The concept is an organism in the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy and maps directly to Lysobacter ginsengisoli (SCTID: 24841000181105). The term 'Final identification' is procedural context and does not introduce site, severity, or causality. Parents (e.g., Lysobacter) or siblings (other Lysobacter species) would be less accurate, and no strain-level child is specified, confirming the precise species code."
1260274001,Caregiver food and/or nutrition priority for subject (observable entity),Caregiver food and/or nutrition priority for subject,"The entry states the exact observable entity: whether the caregiver considers food and/or nutrition a priority for the subject. The main concept is the caregiver's prioritization in the food/nutrition domain, with the subject being the person receiving care. There are no values or qualifiers added. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, representing a question/variable rather than a finding. SCTID 1260274001 is the most precise match because it explicitly names caregiver, food/nutrition, and subject. More generic parent concepts like 'Caregiver priority for subject' would omit the topic, and sibling topics (e.g., housing or education priority) would misrepresent the domain. This entry mirrors the preferred term without altering attributes."
257652008,Old peoples' home (environment),Discharge destination listed as old people's home,"This documents the discharge destination as an old people's home, identifying the target environment. It maps to Old peoples' home (environment) SCTID 257652008. The concept is purely environmental; discharge context does not alter the location type nor imply nursing care. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Parent concepts like residential institution are less precise, and nursing home siblings imply services not specified."
1141906009,Non-latex pressure bandage (physical object),Imaging report reference: non-latex pressure bandage,"The entry indicates that an imaging report references the Physical object, a non-latex pressure bandage. The core concept is the device itself, mapping to 1141906009. The context does not add attributes like presence or location that would change coding, and it avoids procedural language. It is more specific than the parent Pressure bandage and distinct from sibling objects."
270370004,Driving license fitness report (record artifact),Driving license fitness report,"The entry explicitly denotes a report documenting fitness for a driving license. The main concept is a record artifact that captures an assessment of fitness to drive in the licensing context. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This matches Driving license fitness report (270370004) precisely, as it is a report, not the assessment procedure or a certificate. A generic parent such as “Report” would be too broad, and siblings like “Fitness to drive (finding)” or “Driving license medical certificate” are inappropriate because they imply a clinical finding or a certificate rather than the report itself."
710159007,Long-term current use of immunosuppressive drug (situation),Present long-term immunosuppressant medication use.,"This text directly states present (current) long-term use and names the class as immunosuppressant medication, satisfying the attributes needed. It is a Situation with explicit context describing ongoing therapy. SCTID 710159007 is the most precise mapping, as it encodes long-term current use of immunosuppressive drugs. A parent that drops the class or a sibling focusing on specific drug subclasses would not match the wording. “Immunosuppressant medication” is a clinically equivalent synonym for immunosuppressive drug."
1279760004,American Joint Committee on Cancer rpT1c3 (qualifier value),AJCC T-category: rpT1c3,"This phrasing documents the AJCC T-category as rpT1c3, indicating recurrent pathologic T1c3. The concept is an AJCC qualifier value, not a disorder or finding. It aligns with SNOMED CT 1279760004. A parent such as AJCC rpT1 or rpT1c would omit the c3 specificity, and sibling values rpT1c1 or rpT1c2 would alter the subcategory. Forms lacking r or p (e.g., cT1c3) are not equivalent and would miscode the qualifier."
287962007,Postpartum uterine exploration (procedure),Uterus explored postpartum,"This is a concise procedural statement indicating that the uterus was explored in the postpartum period. The core concept is exploration of the uterus after delivery. It maps directly to the Procedure category concept “Postpartum uterine exploration (procedure).” No additional attributes (technique, indication, therapeutic intent) are present, avoiding overlap with sibling procedures such as postpartum curettage or manual placenta removal. It is more precise than the generic “Exploration of uterus” because the postpartum context is included."
363262008,"Phosphorylation, function (observable entity)",Phosphorylation functional property,"Describing function as a “functional property” of phosphorylation is a synonymous way to reference the same observable. No substrate, enzyme, or measurement outcome is provided, keeping it at the correct level of generality for an Observable entity. Broader parents would be non-specific, and narrower children or siblings (activity, rate) are not indicated by this wording. Therefore, the entry appropriately maps to SNOMED CT 363262008."
223677007,San Marino (geographic location),San Marino—country,"The em dash and the word 'country' serve as a clarifier that the referenced entity is the national geographic location, not a city or facility, without adding any patient-related attributes. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s San Marino (geographic location) SCTID 223677007. More general parent categories (e.g., Country) are less specific, and sibling concepts like Italy or Vatican City would be incorrect. The paraphrase remains a clinically equivalent representation of the same location."
11758005,"Quantitative photoplethysmography, venous (procedure)","Photoplethysmography of the venous system, quantitative analysis","The wording articulates photoplethysmography done on the venous system with quantitative analysis, making it a Procedure. SCTID 11758005 matches exactly, combining venous focus with quantitation in PPG. A parent concept such as photoplethysmography (procedure) is too general, and siblings like arterial PPG or qualitative venous PPG fail to meet the quantitative and venous specifications. This is a clinically equivalent phrasing of the preferred term without introducing new attributes."
15748281000119100,Mass of joint of bilateral feet (finding),Lump at foot joint bilaterally,"Using 'lump' is a clinically safe synonym for 'mass' indicating a localized enlargement; the phrase specifies it is at foot joints and bilaterally, fulfilling the concept’s scope. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. Parent concepts lacking laterality or broader locations would be less accurate, while child concepts for single-sided findings would not match the bilateral aspect. It does not introduce a cause or nature (e.g., bony, cystic)."
32060007,Entamoeba ovis (organism),E. ovis,"This is a standard scientific abbreviation for the species Entamoeba ovis and conveys the same organism concept without adding any clinical qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The abbreviation maps directly to SCTID 32060007 'Entamoeba ovis (organism)'. Using a parent concept would lose species specificity, and choosing a sibling species would be erroneous. The wording does not imply presence, infection, or strain-level detail, so the species-level organism concept is the correct and most precise match."
1288037003,History of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of stomach (situation),Chart lists history of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the stomach,"This states that the chart records a history of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the stomach, categorically a Situation. SCTID 1288037003 precisely represents this history concept. Using a disorder code or a broader history code lacking the well-differentiated specification would not be as exact, and siblings with different differentiation are unsuitable. The phrasing maintains the same clinical meaning without introducing extra details."
271516005,Vertebral spinous process bone marrow specimen (specimen),Patient’s bone marrow specimen taken from a vertebral spinous process,"This sentence documents a bone marrow specimen and indicates the anatomical origin as a vertebral spinous process. The concepts present are the specimen (bone marrow) and the site (vertebral spinous process). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The appropriate code is Vertebral spinous process bone marrow specimen (271516005) because of the explicit site detail. A generic Bone marrow specimen parent would omit the anatomical source, and alternative vertebral sites would not match. The verb 'taken' does not imply a specific method, so no procedural attribute is introduced."
328263004,Hypoproteinemia food (product),Clinical nutrition food: hypoproteinemia,"This phrasing indicates a clinical nutrition food product intended for hypoproteinemia, consistent with 'Hypoproteinemia food (product)'. Category: Product. The colon construction is merely stylistic and does not introduce new attributes. Broader categories like 'Clinical nutrition product' would be too general, and formulations (e.g., powder, liquid) would be too specific; thus this is the best match."
224450002,Requesting leave from work (finding),Seeking time off work,"The entry indicates the person is seeking to obtain time off, i.e., requesting leave, without specifying cause or outcome. As a Clinical finding, the most precise code is Requesting leave from work (finding) [224450002]. Broader categories would be less specific, and siblings that indicate actual leave or employer decisions would not match the request action. 'Seeking time off' is an equivalent expression of 'requesting leave' and introduces no new attributes."
35311000087102,Bone plate submitted as specimen (specimen),Lab specimen: bone plate,"This denotes the laboratory specimen type as a bone plate, directly fitting the Specimen category. It avoids additional attributes, such as test type or clinical indications. Naming a bone plate is more specific than parent device specimen concepts and does not suggest sibling devices, ensuring the correct selection of 'Bone plate submitted as specimen.'"
117137004,Structure of fifth intercostal space (body structure),The 5th chest wall interspace,"Describing the interspace of the chest wall with the ordinal '5th' refers to the fifth intercostal space. This corresponds to the SNOMED CT body structure concept 'Structure of fifth intercostal space' (117137004). The entry is anatomically focused and does not add laterality or other attributes. A generic parent like 'Intercostal space' lacks ordinal specificity, and siblings for other interspaces would not match. 'Chest wall interspace' is a clinically acceptable paraphrase and maintains the same anatomical target."
224712009,Area at front of house (environment),Area in front of house,"This is a succinct synonym that indicates the environmental location immediately in front of a house. The main concept is the environment ‘Area at front of house,’ with no extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment; SCTID 224712009 is the precise match. Broader parents like house environment or property would be less specific, while children such as front yard or porch add structural specificity not present in the wording. Siblings like area at back or side of house are incongruent. ‘In front of’ is a clinically safe paraphrase of ‘at the front of,’ maintaining equivalence."
217741006,Accident caused by mud slide (event),Causal mechanism: mud slide accident.,"This entry documents the mechanism underlying the event, explicitly stating a mud slide as the cause of an accident. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the exact match is SCTID 217741006. It does not include any injury outcomes, contextual qualifiers, or timing information, so a pure event concept is appropriate. Parent concepts such as generic accidents or earth movement accidents are too broad, while siblings tied to other causes (e.g., flood) are incorrect. “Mud slide accident” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase indicating an accident caused by a mud slide, without altering code selection."
763202004,Desmeninol calcium (substance),Desmeninol calcium (substance),"This entry repeats the fully qualified preferred term, clearly indicating the SNOMED CT Substance category and mapping to SCTID 763202004. Category: Substance. The addition of “(substance)” reinforces the semantic type and avoids confusion with product concepts. No other attributes are introduced, so this is the most precise match without drifting to parent (desmeninol) or any product siblings."
365328009,Finding related to ability to clean domestic sanitary facilities (finding),Problem list: ability to clean domestic sanitary facilities—finding,"The content describes a problem-list entry that is a clinical finding focused on ability to clean domestic sanitary facilities. This maps directly to SNOMED CT 365328009, a Clinical finding about ability. No level of performance or assistance is indicated, so child concepts are not warranted. Broader parents (e.g., generic ability findings) lack specificity, and related siblings (e.g., ability to clean kitchen) are not the right fit given the sanitary facilities focus."
