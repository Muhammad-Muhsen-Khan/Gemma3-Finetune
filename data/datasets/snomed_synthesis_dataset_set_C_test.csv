sct_id,label,entry,reasoning
788669008,Brevibacillus ginsengisoli (organism),Sample organism designation: Brevibacillus ginsengisoli,"The entry designates the organism in a sample as Brevibacillus ginsengisoli, without specifying specimen type, site, or clinical interpretation. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact species concept Brevibacillus ginsengisoli (788669008) is correct. Mapping to a parent genus or a general presence finding would be less precise since the species name is provided and no extra attributes are introduced."
1204489009,Northern Mariana Islands (geographic location),Northern Mariana Islands — Northern Marianas,"Presenting the preferred term alongside its common synonym references a single geographic entity. The category is Geographic location (Location). The appropriate code is Northern Mariana Islands (geographic location), SCTID 1204489009; it is neither the entire Mariana Islands archipelago nor any specific island within it. No attributes beyond naming are added."
76196003,Cavernous (qualifier value),Described as cavernous,"The phrasing uses ""cavernous"" only as a descriptive qualifier, which belongs to the Qualifier value category. The best code is SCTID 76196003 because there is no mention of lesion type, site, timing, or severity. This avoids misclassification to anatomical or disease-specific concepts."
16209771000119101,Specimen from left lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage procedure (specimen),Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid — left lower lobe (specimen),"This presents the specimen type (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and states the site (left lower lobe). The main concept is a specimen; attributes are method (BAL) and site (left lower lobe of lung). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 16209771000119101 is the exact fit due to its encoding of a BAL specimen from the left lower lobe. Parent concepts lacking lobar detail or siblings for other lobes would be less precise. The inclusion of “(specimen)” clarifies the object, distinguishing it from a procedure description."
87021001,Mechanical vitrectomy by pars plana approach (procedure),Mechanical PPV (pars plana vitrectomy),"PPV stands for pars plana vitrectomy; adding “Mechanical” identifies the use of a vitrector, matching Mechanical vitrectomy by pars plana approach (87021001). Category: Procedure. This is more specific than PPV without method and excludes manual PPV and different approaches. No new attributes are introduced, so the concept and code selection remain consistent with 87021001."
223629007,Tuvalu (geographic location),Origin: Tuvalu,"“Origin: Tuvalu” uses a contextual label indicative of demographic or epidemiologic origin, but the value is the country Tuvalu. The main concept is the geographic location of Tuvalu. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The appropriate code is Tuvalu (geographic location) SCTID 223629007, as the entry refers to the specific country. Broader parents (e.g., Pacific region) or more specific children (e.g., island groups) would not be correct. The term ‘origin’ is contextual and does not change the underlying location."
237023002,Haultain's operation (procedure),Haultain’s operation recorded in the file,"A record context that explicitly names Haultain’s operation still denotes the same procedural concept; the SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The eponym aligns precisely with SCTID 237023002 and differentiates it from generic repair or other named methods. The wording avoids additional clinical attributes, keeping the concept focused solely on the named operation."
31259008,Semicossyphus pulcher (organism),Entry—Semicossyphus pulcher,"Despite the contextual label 'Entry—', the core content is the species Semicossyphus pulcher. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This is the exact species concept SCTID 31259008, without added attributes such as exposure, allergy, or clinical event. Parent or sibling taxa are not implied by the wording. The context framing does not alter the organism identification."
269687000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, squash court (environment)",ED triage: accident place recorded as squash court,"Within an ED triage context, this notes that the recorded place of an accident was a squash court, conveying only the environmental location of the event. The main concept is the squash court as the accident place-of-occurrence. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It maps directly to SCTID 269687000; citing ED triage is documentation context and does not alter the core concept. The generic parent is too broad, and sibling locations would not match the explicit court. The phrasing uses standard synonyms for place-of-occurrence and remains within the same code."
40896003,"Streptococcus, group R (organism)","Lab organism designation: Streptococcus, group R","This is a laboratory designation naming the organism Streptococcus, group R, with no assertion of infection, body site, or test result status. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The precise code is 40896003. Broader Streptococcus parents or different group-letter siblings are not accurate; diagnosis or result concepts would add attributes not present."
450367002,Paenibacillus taichungensis (organism),Culture isolate: Paenibacillus taichungensis,"This lab-report style entry names the organism from a culture as Paenibacillus taichungensis without any clinical or site attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact species code Paenibacillus taichungensis (450367002) is appropriate. Using a parent concept (Paenibacillus genus) or a broader bacterium category would reduce specificity, while siblings are not implied. The phrase 'Culture isolate' is contextual and does not introduce a different concept."
768844001,Purine and/or purine derivative (substance),Purine or purine derivative (substance),"This phrasing maintains the class scope by indicating either purine itself or any purine derivative and explicitly labels it as a substance, aligning with the SNOMED CT Substance category. It does not add context such as exposure, allergy, or therapy, so it remains a pure substance designation. A broader parent concept (e.g., organic chemical) would not capture the purine-specific class, and a child concept (e.g., a single derivative) would overly restrict the meaning. The synonym “purine or purine derivative” is semantically equivalent to “and/or” in this classification context and does not change code selection."
1382028005,Arthritis therapy vagus nerve implantable electrical stimulator (physical object),Device: implantable electrical stimulator targeting the vagus nerve for arthritis,"This describes a device whose attributes are implantable, electrical stimulation, target vagus nerve, and purpose arthritis therapy. Category: Physical object. It matches SCTID 1382028005 precisely. A parent concept of implantable vagus nerve stimulator without the arthritis indication is less specific, and any sibling indicating a different target or therapy (e.g., depression) would not match. The phrasing is a documentation style label that remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
605954641000119109,Sensation of foreign body in eye (finding),Patient describes foreign body sensation involving eye,"The wording captures a patient’s description of sensing a foreign body localized to the eye, mapping to the Clinical finding category. No additional attributes (laterality, etiology, severity) are introduced. It is more accurate than broader eye symptom parents and does not suggest actual foreign body presence. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term without changing the code."
702021001,Vaginal tightening dressing (physical object),Vaginal tightening dressing in stock,"Inventory status indicates the object’s availability while the named concept remains a vaginal tightening dressing, corresponding to SCTID 702021001. The SNOMED category is Physical object. The wording avoids procedural application or clinical findings, ensuring the focus is the item itself. Broader dressing categories would be less specific; sibling objects such as vaginal packs or tampons are different products, making the precise physical object concept the best match."
89972002,Hospital-based outpatient oncology clinic (environment),Facility setting: hospital-based outpatient oncology clinic,"This describes the facility setting as the hospital-based outpatient oncology clinic environment. Category: Environment. While “facility” is used, the core concept remains the environment of a hospital outpatient oncology clinic, fitting 89972002. Broader hospital outpatient facility environments without oncology specificity or non-hospital oncology clinics do not match as precisely. No extra attributes are included."
242079006,Fall from stationary railway vehicle (event),Fall from an immobile railway vehicle.,"This is a fall from a railway vehicle described as 'immobile,' which conveys the stationary attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242079006 is the correct code as the event involves a fall from a non-moving railway vehicle. The parent concept does not specify stationary versus moving, and sibling concepts involving moving vehicles are incompatible with 'immobile.' The wording introduces no other attributes."
447984009,Excision of cyst of vallecula of epiglottis using laser (procedure),Surgical excision with laser of cyst at the epiglottic vallecula,"The entry specifies a surgical excision performed with laser and pinpoints the lesion at the epiglottic vallecula. This is directly aligned to SNOMED CT Procedure 447984009. Parent concepts lack either the site or the laser method. Sibling procedures (e.g., endoscopic marsupialization, drainage, or excision without laser) are not consistent with the stated modality. “Surgical excision with laser” is a clinically equivalent expression of laser excision without changing the code selection."
255345002,Hemorrhagic (qualifier value),Labeled as hemorrhagic,"The phrase “Labeled as hemorrhagic” conveys a classification tag without asserting a bleeding event or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, best matched to 255345002. It is not a clinical finding or disorder; rather, it is an attribute attached to another concept. Using a broader parent qualifier would lose specificity, and choosing a sibling descriptor (e.g., ischemic) would change the meaning. Therefore, the hemorrhagic qualifier is the correct, most precise code."
129460009,"Compression paddle, device (physical object)",Patient reports a compression paddle was used,"A patient-reported statement identifies that a compression paddle was used, clearly pointing to the device without added specifics. SNOMED CT category: Device (physical object). This appropriately codes to Compression paddle, device (SCTID: 129460009). No modality, size, or site details imply a more specific child concept. Broad parents would be imprecise, and sibling devices such as plates or clamps are different items."
49264007,Excision of lesion of anus (procedure),Excision of a lesion of the anus,"Adding an article does not change the meaning; it still specifies excision of a lesion at the anus. This is a Procedure concept and maps to SCTID 49264007. Broader excision notions without site or sibling procedures at nearby sites (perianal, rectal) are less appropriate. No additional attributes are added, maintaining clinical equivalence with the preferred term."
846613007,Community physiotherapy (environment),Encounter setting—community physiotherapy,"This denotes the encounter’s environment as community physiotherapy, placing it within SNOMED’s environment hierarchy. It aligns best with Community physiotherapy (environment) [846613007]. The wording does not introduce actions (e.g., referral, treatment), and avoids broader or different locations such as hospital physiotherapy (environment) or home physiotherapy (environment). The dash formatting is stylistic and does not alter the meaning; the concept remains the specific community physiotherapy setting."
48331004,Listeria innocua (organism),Organism: Listeria innocua,"This phrasing labels the taxonomic entity explicitly as an organism and names the species Listeria innocua. It conveys no additional clinical attributes (e.g., presence in a specimen or infection), only the organism designation. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, with the most precise concept being Listeria innocua (organism), SCTID 48331004. Using a parent concept like Listeria (organism) would reduce specificity, and no sibling species are referenced. The structure is common in lab or clinical documentation and still codes to the species-level organism."
711456004,Fetal exposure to drug (situation),Prenatal ultrasound report comment: fetal exposure to drug,"Within an imaging report comment, the documented situation remains fetal exposure to a drug, without naming the drug or adding attributes. This is a Situation. SNOMED CT 711456004 is the most accurate code as it explicitly represents fetal exposure to drug. Parents like fetal exposure to chemical lack specificity, children naming specific drugs would be too detailed for the text, and siblings pertaining to other exposure types are not aligned with the stated 'drug.'"
42148006,Tricholipeurus lipeuroides (organism),Taxonomic identification: Tricholipeurus lipeuroides,"Main concept: Tricholipeurus lipeuroides, identified taxonomically. No associated condition or host attribute is stated. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The species-level binomial compels selection of SCTID 42148006. The prefix “Taxonomic identification” is contextual, not a distinct clinical finding concept. Parents (genus, lice groups) or siblings are too broad or incorrect relative to the exact species."
29922007,Cutaneous reflex (observable entity),Neuro exam item—cutaneous reflex,"The text places the observable within the context of a neurological exam checklist but names only the observable itself (cutaneous reflex) and does not describe a procedure being done or a result. Category: Observable entity. The best code is SCTID 29922007 because the phrase refers to the observed property rather than a specific test or a specific reflex subtype. Parent concepts are too broad, while child/sibling concepts like abdominal or plantar reflexes are not mentioned."
405826006,BRCA2 mutation carrier detection test (procedure),BRCA2 carrier detection laboratory test,"The phrase clearly denotes a laboratory test for BRCA2 carrier detection, precisely aligning with 'BRCA2 mutation carrier detection test'. The main concept is a lab-based procedure determining BRCA2 carrier status. Category: Procedure. It does not introduce broader genetic testing or another gene, thereby maintaining precision versus parent or sibling concepts. 'Laboratory test' is a synonymous procedural descriptor and does not alter code selection."
242325006,Accidental ingestion of honey suckle berries (event),Accidental eating of honeysuckle berries,"This entry states an accidental event of oral ingestion (‘eating’) with the specific substance honeysuckle berries. It is an Event in SNOMED CT and corresponds to SCTID 242325006. Using a broader ingestion event or a different substance would be less specific, and shifting to a disorder (poisoning) would introduce a clinical outcome not present. The synonym ‘eating’ is equivalent to ingestion for coding purposes, keeping the concept unchanged."
215981006,"Forced landing while landing, occupant of unpowered aircraft, except parachutist, injured (event)","Nonpowered aircraft emergency landing at landing stage, occupant injured.","This entry uses synonymous terms (‘nonpowered’ for unpowered; ‘emergency landing’ for forced landing) and specifies the landing stage with an injured occupant. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 215981006 is the correct match; concepts for powered aircraft, parachutists, or takeoff/cruise phases would not be appropriate."
248644001,Finding of alternating pulse volume (finding),Alternating pulse volume persists throughout exam,"This indicates the presence of alternating pulse volume during the examination, focusing on the finding itself. Category: Clinical finding. It appropriately maps to SNOMED CT 248644001 and does not add unrelated attributes; noting persistence is contextual and does not imply severity or cause. It remains distinct from other pulse abnormalities such as paradoxical pulse or bisferiens, preserving precise coding."
215272008,"Collision between animal being ridden and another animal, rider of animal injured (event)",Rider injury following collision between ridden animal and another animal.,"This entry states that the rider was injured and that the mechanism was a collision involving a ridden animal and another animal. The main concept centers on the collision event with specific participants and an injured rider. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 215272008 fits exactly because it requires both the collision with another animal and rider injury. A generic rider injury or non-collision riding accident would not capture the collision mechanism, and siblings like object collisions are excluded by the wording. The phrasing is concise but fully equivalent to the concept."
444865001,Expressed breast milk specimen before breast cleansing (specimen),Lab specimen: expressed breast milk collected before breast cleansing,"This lab-context entry identifies the specimen as expressed breast milk and includes the key attribute that collection was before breast cleansing. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The context does not introduce extra attributes beyond specimen type and timing, so SCTID 444865001 is the precise match. A generic expressed breast milk specimen without timing would be insufficient, and a post-cleansing sibling would contradict the stated condition."
227159002,Fried shrimp (substance),Diet recall includes fried shrimp,"This indicates fried shrimp as a listed food in a diet recall. Category: Substance. The entry points to shrimp prepared by frying only, without adding seasoning, breading, or other methods. Parent generic shrimp lacks the preparation detail, and sibling concepts (e.g., grilled or battered shrimp) would be incorrect. Fried shrimp (227159002) is the precise code."
1285640000,Smear from respiratory specimen (specimen),Smear preparation from respiratory specimen,"The phrase indicates a smear preparation derived from a respiratory specimen, which is a Specimen concept. 'Preparation' is a standard synonym in laboratory context for smear without altering meaning. The most precise code is SCTID 1285640000. More general concepts like Respiratory specimen omit the smear attribute, and more specific children would name a particular respiratory specimen subtype, which this entry does not."
439034006,Tissue specimen from liver obtained by excision (specimen),Clinic note: liver tissue specimen obtained through excision,"This clinic note documents a liver tissue specimen obtained via excision, clearly identifying source and method. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to 439034006. Parents that omit method are overly broad, and siblings involving biopsy techniques or organ resections are inconsistent with the explicit excision of tissue. The entry avoids additional attributes beyond the specimen’s acquisition."
1290216001,Nonpoint source pollution (environment),Nonpoint source pollution,"The main concept stated is nonpoint source pollution, which denotes environmental pollution originating from diffuse, multiple sources rather than a single identifiable discharge. No additional attributes such as medium (water, air), cause, severity, or timing are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this is an Environment or geographical location category concept, precisely matching Nonpoint source pollution (environment) SCTID 1290216001. Using a broader parent like Environmental pollution would be less specific, and a sibling like Point source pollution would be incorrect. Child concepts that specify the medium or a particular sector would be overly specific. The wording directly aligns with the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
286278006,Does not articulate words (finding),"""I don’t articulate words.""","A patient-reported statement that they do not articulate words reflects the same Clinical finding as observed documentation. The precise SNOMED CT match is Does not articulate words (finding) SCTID 286278006 because it identifies absence of word articulation without cause or severity. Concepts such as mutism, aphonia, dysarthria, anarthria, or aphasia are more specific or mechanistic and not indicated by this self-report. The quoted form is a stylistic context and does not change the concept."
216141009,"Fall in aircraft, not due to an accident to aircraft, member of ground crew or airline employee injured (event)",Ground crew injured by fall within aircraft; not associated with accident to aircraft.,"The text specifies a fall within an aircraft causing injury to ground crew and clarifies it was not associated with an accident to the aircraft, exactly matching the constraints of SNOMED CT Event 216141009. “Within aircraft” and “not associated with accident to aircraft” retain location and exclusion requirements. Parent-level fall-in-aircraft entries without role detail and sibling entries involving passengers or aircraft accidents are not as precise."
228230007,Cape (physical object),Cape documented among clothing.,"The entry records a cape among clothing, specifying the garment explicitly. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The best code is Cape (physical object) [228230007], as the item is a cape. Using a parent like Clothing would be less specific, and choosing another garment would be inaccurate. The phrase “among clothing” is contextual and does not alter the object’s identity or add attributes."
223500001,Asia (geographic location),Residence location: Asia,"The field label 'Residence location' provides context, but the codable concept is still Asia, aligning with Asia (geographic location), SCTID 223500001. Main concept: Asia as a place. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). The residence context does not convert the value into an ethnicity or a 'residence finding'; it remains a geographic location value. Parent locations would be less specific; child regions would over-specify. The wording remains semantically equivalent to naming the continent Asia."
289551009,Finding of color of vaginal discharge (finding),Colour of vaginal discharge recorded.,"Using UK spelling 'Colour,' the entry states that the color of vaginal discharge was recorded, which is a clinical finding. This maps to SNOMED CT 289551009 (Finding of color of vaginal discharge), a Clinical finding. It avoids specifying any particular color and does not add attributes such as severity or timing, so child concepts are inappropriate. General discharge findings would be less specific. The synonym 'colour' is clinically equivalent to 'color' and does not change the code selection, and this remains a finding rather than an abstract observable."
213781000,"Collision between railway vehicles followed by derailment, passenger injured (event)",Passenger hurt during collision of trains followed by derailment,"‘Passenger hurt’ is a clinically safe synonym for ‘passenger injured.’ The entry specifies trains (railway vehicles), a collision, and a subsequent derailment. The concept belongs to the Event category. SCTID 213781000 is the most accurate match because it requires the exact combination noted. Broader or sibling concepts lacking the derailment, the collision, or the passenger role would be less precise. Using ‘hurt’ does not introduce severity or timing beyond the event; it maintains equivalence with ‘injured’ and does not change code selection."
705373003,Artificial larynx (physical object),Artificial larynx kept at bedside,"The phrase identifies the artificial larynx and its location, maintaining focus on the physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 705373003 is the correct selection because ‘kept at bedside’ is contextual but does not change the device identity. Broader parent categories are nonspecific, and siblings like internal voice prosthesis or generic speech aids would misclassify the particular external artificial larynx referenced."
36383004,Entire outer surface of second rib (body structure),Outer surface of rib 2,"The wording specifies the outer surface and the exact rib (rib 2), representing a body structure and matching SNOMED CT concept 36383004. No laterality or condition is included. The specificity to the second rib makes it more precise than general rib surface parents, and the focus on 'outer' excludes siblings such as inner surface, ensuring 36383004 is the best fit."
360027009,Interposition - action (qualifier value),"For modeling, the action value chosen is interposition.","The phrase describes selection of ‘interposition’ as the action value during procedure modeling, aligning with SNOMED CT’s action qualifier. The category is Qualifier value. This is a precise fit for SCTID 360027009, with no added attributes. Parent action concepts lack specificity, and sibling actions like ‘insertion’ or ‘bypass’ are not equivalent. The wording remains strictly within the action attribute."
223904003,West Yorkshire (geographic location),"West Yorkshire, England","This entry identifies West Yorkshire and situates it within England for clarity, but the core concept remains the specific geographic location West Yorkshire. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (environment). The correct code is 223904003 because the entity being named is West Yorkshire. The inclusion of the country does not shift the coding to the parent concept “England,” nor does it introduce a different attribute; it simply contextualizes the location without changing the target concept."
418063007,Surgical inferior margin involved by ductal carcinoma in situ (finding),Surgical inferior margin involved by DCIS.,"The entry directly restates the preferred concept, clearly identifying the surgical inferior margin and DCIS involvement. Category: Clinical finding. This is an exact fit to SNOMED CT 418063007. Broader parent concepts (“surgical margin involved by DCIS” without orientation) or different orientation siblings would not reflect the explicit inferior orientation given here."
244772005,Entire lateral pterygoid muscle (body structure),lateral pterygoid muscle,"The entry explicitly names the anatomical structure “lateral pterygoid muscle” without specifying side, head, or condition, indicating the whole muscle. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The most precise match is SCTID 244772005, Entire lateral pterygoid muscle, because it represents the complete lateral pterygoid muscle. Broader parents like “muscle of mastication” or “pterygoid muscle” are too general, and siblings such as “medial pterygoid muscle” are different structures. Children like right/left lateral pterygoid or superior/inferior head introduce subdivisions not present here. The wording does not add attributes, so the entire muscle concept is appropriate."
310506006,Reason for termination of pregnancy (observable entity),Indication for termination of pregnancy,"Here, 'indication' is a clinically standard synonym for 'reason' in the context of procedures. The entry describes the observable capturing the indication for TOP. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s Observable entity class. SCTID 310506006 targets the reason for TOP specifically, which is more precise than any parent 'indication for procedure' concept. The wording does not introduce qualifiers (e.g., elective vs. therapeutic), thus avoiding mapping to children or siblings with those constraints."
466849009,Bladder/bowel-evacuation electrical stimulation system (physical object),Equipment list entry—bladder and bowel evacuation e-stimulation system,"This entry lists equipment that is an electrical stimulation system for bladder and bowel evacuation, using the abbreviation e-stimulation. The main concept is the physical device; attributes include electrical stimulation and dual-organ evacuation. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). “E-stimulation” is a common synonym for electrical stimulation and does not change code selection, keeping alignment with SCTID 466849009. Broader parents lack the specified application, while siblings limited to bladder-only or bowel-only, or those specifying sacral nerve targets or implantability, are not supported by the entry."
787774005,Superficial foreign body suspected (situation),Impression: superficial foreign body suspected,"The clinical impression denotes suspected presence of a superficial foreign body, keeping the superficial qualifier without confirmation or added details. This belongs to the Situation category. SNOMED CT code 787774005 precisely matches suspected superficial foreign body. Parent concepts without the superficial qualifier would be less exact, and confirmed or site-specific variants would add attributes not present. “Impression” contextualizes the suspicion but does not change the concept’s semantics."
736069001,"Venous pressure monitor, noninvasive detection (physical object)",Training device: noninvasive venous pressure monitor,"This entry names the device used for training: a noninvasive venous pressure monitor, consistent with a Physical object (Device). It points to the equipment itself, not an action or observable, so SCTID 736069001 is the best match. Parent categories are too generic, and sibling concepts such as invasive venous or arterial monitors are excluded. The training context does not modify the device definition or introduce new attributes."
446674003,Specimen from abscess of liver (specimen),Source: liver abscess (specimen),"This entry documents the specimen’s source as a liver abscess, explicitly stating it is a specimen. The concept is a Specimen taken from an abscess in the liver, which matches “Specimen from abscess of liver.” There are no hints of a specific collection method or specimen subtype, avoiding more granular child concepts. It is not a parent-level unspecified abscess specimen nor a disorder term. The wording is site-specific and origin-specific, making the chosen concept the best fit."
284875001,Ability to cut own toenails (observable entity),Capacity to cut own toenails,"This phrasing uses 'capacity' as a clinically equivalent synonym for 'ability,' maintaining the same observable entity regarding self-toenail cutting. It presents the variable to be assessed, not an outcome or degree, thus aligning with the SNOMED CT category Observable entity. More specific findings (able/unable) are not stated and would be inappropriate. Broader grooming or nail-care concepts would be less precise. 'Own' ensures the self-directed aspect of the task is maintained."
224881003,Charitable nursing home (environment),Telehealth conducted with patient at a charitable nursing home,"This notes the patient's physical setting during telehealth as a charitable nursing home, an environment/place type. It aligns with SNOMED CT Charitable nursing home (environment) [224881003]. Choosing the broader Nursing home (environment) would lose the charitable specificity, and other siblings (private/government or non-nursing residential homes) would be incorrect. The telehealth context does not alter the core environment concept."
54903004,Brewster's warbler (organism),Brewster’s warbler designation,"This indicates the designation (name) Brewster’s warbler, which directly points to the organism entity. The concept category is Organism and the exact SNOMED concept is Brewster's warbler (organism), SCTID 54903004. 'Designation' is a naming context that does not introduce extra attributes or shift coding to parent or sibling organisms."
734336008,Specimen from aorta (specimen),Pathology specimen from aorta,"This entry states the specimen submitted to pathology originates from the aorta. It does not specify the specimen subtype (e.g., biopsy, excision), segment (ascending vs. abdominal), or any associated condition. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The best match is SCTID 734336008 “Specimen from aorta (specimen).” Parent categories like “Cardiovascular specimen” are less specific, and children/siblings such as “Biopsy specimen from aorta” or “Specimen from aortic valve” add details not present or reference a different site. The mention of “pathology” is contextual and does not alter the specimen concept."
297739004,Temne language (qualifier value),Temne language (qualifier value),"By explicitly naming the language and its SNOMED CT category, the entry points directly to Temne language (qualifier value), SCTID 297739004. This is a Qualifier value concept representing the language label only. No attributes such as speaking ability, preference, or interpreter use are implied, keeping it distinct from findings or procedures. Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise than the exact named language."
40511003,Eluate (specimen),Elution product specimen,"The wording 'elution product specimen' describes the specimen as the product of an elution, which is synonymous with 'eluate.' There is no mention of source or other attributes. The category is Specimen. Eluate (specimen) SCTID 40511003 is the precise match as the term equates to the eluate produced by elution. Mapping to a parent 'Specimen' would be insufficiently specific, and mapping to siblings like 'Filtrate' or 'Extract' would be incorrect because the process and material are distinct. The synonym does not change the code selection."
10796004,Glucose-6-phosphate (substance),Patient asked about glucose-6-phosphate.,"Although framed as a patient inquiry, the content references only the substance glucose-6-phosphate and does not imply diagnosis, measurement, treatment, or role. The correct SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 10796004 is exact. Broader or alternate-position compounds would not match the wording. The context of a question does not add attributes; it remains a straightforward mention of the substance."
58482006,Hospital-based outpatient gastroenterology clinic (environment),Outpatient gastroenterology clinic located in a hospital,"This entry specifies an outpatient gastroenterology clinic situated within a hospital, defining the environment. The attributes of outpatient care, hospital-based location, and GI specialty map directly to SNOMED CT Environment code 58482006. Parent concepts without specialty or siblings/children denoting different settings (community outpatient GI, inpatient GI) do not match. The statement contains no added attributes beyond the environment, supporting precise mapping to 58482006."
33355008,Blood group antibody Banks (substance),Anti-Banks (blood group),"This shorthand specifies the anti-Banks antibody within the blood group context, directly referencing the substance. There is no implication of presence in a patient or lab result, and no subclass or reagent status is indicated, so it is a Substance. The precise SNOMED CT match is Blood group antibody Banks (substance), SCTID 33355008. Generic blood group antibody or other named antibodies would be less specific or incorrect. The parenthetical clarification ensures the context is blood group without altering the core meaning."
728035002,Entire first intermetatarsal joint (body structure),Target structure for exam: first intermetatarsal joint (entire),"Although framed as an exam target, the only concept referenced is the whole first intermetatarsal joint. There are no additional attributes such as findings or side. The category remains Body structure. The wording aligns with SCTID 728035002 by specifying the entire joint. Broader or different joints (e.g., metatarsophalangeal, tarsometatarsal) are excluded, and no substructure is singled out, making parent or child concepts less appropriate."
217403000,Burning caused by conflagration in dormitory of educational institution (event),Burning due to conflagration affecting college dormitory,"The entry identifies burning due to a conflagration affecting a college dormitory, satisfying the location and mechanism required for SCTID 217403000. SNOMED CT category: Event. 'College dormitory' fits the educational institution dorm context. It does not specify intent, severity, or clinical injury, avoiding misclassification. Broader or different-location fire event concepts are less accurate than this precise match, and the synonyms used are clinically equivalent."
699378001,Negativicutes (organism),Result: Negativicutes,"The entry conveys a result naming Negativicutes, focusing solely on the organism class and introducing no site, severity, or temporal data. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It maps to Negativicutes (organism) [699378001]. Parent classes like Firmicutes would be insufficiently specific, and child taxa (e.g., Veillonella) would be over-specific relative to the wording. The reporting context ('Result') does not affect the organism concept selection."
315494001,Born in Norway (finding),Patient born in Norway,"This clinician-style documentation states that the patient was born in Norway, conveying birthplace without additional qualifiers. It is a Clinical finding. The best match is SNOMED CT 315494001 'Born in Norway (finding)'. Broader parent concepts like 'Place of birth finding' lack the country specificity, and sibling concepts (other countries) would not match. The context ('Patient') does not alter the meaning; it still solely denotes being born in Norway."
242334001,Accidental ingestion of oleander berries (event),Patient reports accidental ingestion of oleander berries.,"This patient-reported documentation still conveys the same core event: accidental ingestion of oleander berries. The reporting context does not alter the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and SCTID 242334001 is the most precise code. Broader ingestion/exposure concepts or those specifying other oleander parts would be less accurate, and disorder codes (poisoning) would not encode the event itself."
396906004,Specimen from thymus gland obtained by video assisted thoracoscopy (specimen),Surgical specimen from thymus taken by video-assisted thoracoscopy,"This denotes a specimen from the thymus, specifying that it was taken using video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The surgical context does not add procedural subtype details; it simply reinforces that the collection occurred via VATS, making SCTID 396906004 the precise match. Parent concepts lacking the method or site, and siblings with alternative methods, are less appropriate. No mention of biopsy or resection is made."
1193627008,"Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (geographic location)",BES islands,"The entry uses the standard acronym BES, which unambiguously denotes Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba as one geographic unit. No extra attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 1193627008 is the correct code since BES islands is a direct synonym; mapping to a parent regional concept or to one of the three individual islands would misrepresent the scope."
1156096005,Past pregnancy history of complication occurring during labor and delivery (situation),Patient reports a previous birth was complicated during labor and delivery.,"The entry is a patient-reported past event of a complication that occurred specifically during labor and delivery. The core concept is historical intrapartum complication, not current and not specifying type. This is a Situation with explicit context, matching SCTID 1156096005. Using a parent such as “history of obstetric complication” is less specific, and selecting a current intrapartum complication finding is inappropriate because the timing is past. “Previous birth” here is a synonym for labor/delivery and remains clinically equivalent without adding attributes."
701679003,"Catheter-connected infant/pediatric urine collection bag, sterile (physical object)","Sterile infant urinary collection bag, catheter-linked","This phrase identifies a sterile urinary collection bag for infants that is linked to a catheter. The main concept is a product/device. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It maps to SCTID 701679003 by maintaining infant/pediatric applicability, catheter connection, and sterility. Parent terms that are generic or non-sterile are less specific; siblings such as non-catheter infant urine bags or adult versions differ in attributes. The wording uses equivalent synonyms and does not introduce additional attributes."
255346001,Heterologous (qualifier value),Heterologous,"The entry contains only the term “Heterologous,” which denotes a standalone attribute value. The main concept is the qualifier value ‘heterologous’ without any additional clinical context or attributes. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SNOMED CT code 255346001 (Heterologous) precisely matches this usage as an attribute value and is more specific than parent categories like ‘Qualifier value.’ Sibling values such as ‘autologous,’ ‘allogeneic,’ ‘homologous,’ or ‘xenogeneic’ are not mentioned, and no procedure or product context (e.g., transplant, vaccine) is introduced, so those concepts would be less appropriate."
314829001,Tactile discrimination left foot abnormal (finding),Tactile discrimination testing abnormal in left foot,"This entry notes that testing of tactile discrimination shows abnormal results in the left foot. Attributes: tactile discrimination as the modality, abnormal outcome, and site (left foot); category: Clinical finding. SCTID 314829001 is exact. Parent concepts lacking site are too generalized, while sibling/child concepts naming specific tests (e.g., two-point discrimination) would be narrower than the entry’s general tactile discrimination. The wording remains within the general modality and does not introduce timing, severity, or cause."
223851002,Regions of France (geographic location),France—regions (geographic),"This entry explicitly classifies the term as geographic regions of France, aligning with the concept 'Regions of France.' The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The parent country concept is too broad, and specific child regional names are too narrow; sibling entities (departments/cities) are different types. SCTID 223851002 is the correct code."
27468005,Naming (observable entity),Cognitive-linguistic exam: naming,"The wording identifies naming as the examined attribute within a cognitive-linguistic assessment, which corresponds to an observable entity. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. While the exam context is noted, the coded concept remains the attribute 'Naming.' This is more specific than broader cognitive-linguistic constructs and does not invoke child modalities. SCTID 27468005 fits best."
367987007,Structure of shaft of eighth rib (body structure),Exam focus: eighth rib body,"In the context of an examination, the entry identifies the body (shaft) of the eighth rib. The concept is an anatomical Body structure, and the precise SNOMED CT code is 367987007. The wording avoids adding laterality or pathology; it simply names the substructure. Parent concepts like the entire eighth rib would not be as specific, and sibling structures such as the rib head or neck are excluded. The synonym “body” is equivalent to “shaft” for rib anatomy."
119325001,Skin (tissue) specimen (specimen),Skin specimen (tissue),"This expresses that the specimen is skin and explicitly clarifies it as tissue, avoiding ambiguity with swabs or fluids. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It aligns with 119325001 Skin (tissue) specimen. Parent concepts like specimen of tissue lack the skin attribute, and children implying particular procedures (e.g., biopsy types) do not apply."
388056001,Scomber scombrus specific immunoglobulin E (substance),sIgE for Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus),"This describes specific IgE to Atlantic mackerel, explicitly linked to Scomber scombrus, without introducing test results or actions. It is a Substance concept and maps precisely to SCTID 388056001. Parent concepts that omit species or sibling species concepts would not match the wording. The abbreviation 'sIgE' and the common/scientific names are clinically equivalent descriptors of the same substance."
16214291000119108,Specimen from right upper lobe of lung obtained by endobronchial biopsy (specimen),Endobronchial lung biopsy specimen—RUL,"This is a concise specimen entry indicating an endobronchial lung biopsy specimen and the specific site abbreviated as RUL (right upper lobe). The main concept is a specimen from the right upper lobe of the lung obtained by endobronchial biopsy. Category: Specimen. It aligns with SCTID 16214291000119108. Parent concepts missing site specificity or technique, and sibling concepts like transbronchial specimens or other lobes are less appropriate. The abbreviation RUL is widely accepted and does not change the semantics."
39539005,Abnormal renal function (finding),Clinical summary: abnormal renal function,"The clinical summary records abnormal renal function as a finding. This belongs to the Clinical finding category and maps to SCTID 39539005. No details on acute/chronic status, failure, quantitative measures, or etiologies are provided, so parent concepts are too broad and child concepts (AKI, CKD, decreased GFR, elevated creatinine) are too specific. The wording unambiguously fits Abnormal renal function (finding)."
430726002,Family history of tremor (situation),Positive family history: tremor,"The entry specifies that the family history is positive for tremor, mapping precisely to “Family history of tremor” (430726002). Category: Situation. It does not introduce details about the patient’s current status or the type/severity of tremor. Parent concepts are too general, and child/sibling concepts like “Family history of essential tremor” are not supported by the text. The phrasing is a conventional clinical synonym that retains the same coding intent."
217490007,Uncontrolled fire in mine (event),Uncontrolled fire occurring in a mine,"Main concept: a fire that is uncontrolled, occurring in the setting of a mine. Attributes: uncontrolled status and mine location. SNOMED CT category: Event. The wording aligns with SCTID 217490007, preserving the essential elements. Parent concepts lacking the location or siblings representing different events (explosion, controlled fire) are inappropriate. No mention of mine type, etiology, severity, or outcomes is made, so the mapping remains precise."
108780008,Product containing topoisomerase inhibitor (product),Topoisomerase inhibitor therapy drug product,"This phrasing identifies a drug product used in therapy that belongs to the topoisomerase inhibitor class, maintaining focus on the product rather than administration. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It corresponds to 108780008 because it defines the product by its inhibitor class without specifying an individual ingredient, subtype, or dosage form. A broader parent like antineoplastic products would lack specificity, while children naming particular inhibitors or I/II subclasses would be too detailed. The word “therapy” is contextual and does not change the underlying product concept."
223787002,South Island (geographic location),Service location: South Island,"The entry identifies the location where service relates as “South Island,” preserving the same geographic entity. SNOMED CT category: Location/Geographic location. The service context does not introduce a different SNOMED concept; the place is the target of coding. Parent (New Zealand) is too broad, and sibling/child locations are incorrect. Code 223787002 is appropriate."
264887000,Not isolated (qualifier value),Isolation: not isolated.,"This entry explicitly frames the isolation status and assigns it as 'not isolated.' The only concept present is the qualifier value governing isolation, without specifying an organism, site, method, or time. It correctly belongs to the Qualifier value category and matches Not isolated (qualifier value) [264887000]. Using a sibling like Isolated would invert meaning, and mapping to findings like No growth or Not detected would add lab-result semantics not contained in the text."
702920002,Seizure clinic (environment),Location of care: seizure clinic,"The entry documents the care location as the seizure clinic, focusing on the environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This is a precise match to Seizure clinic (environment) SCTID 702920002. Broader clinic concepts or different specialty clinics are not indicated. 'Location of care' is a common synonym for environment and does not change the code selection."
248436008,Slightly remittent fever (finding),"Pyrexia, slightly remittent","Here, ""pyrexia"" is a clinically equivalent synonym for fever, and ""slightly remittent"" specifies the pattern: small downward fluctuations without return to normal. This is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 248436008 (Slightly remittent fever) matches exactly; using the parent ""Remittent fever"" would omit the slight qualifier, and siblings like intermittent or continuous fever do not fit the described behavior. The synonym ""pyrexia"" does not introduce new attributes; it simply replaces the term ""fever."" No duration, causation, or severity beyond the inherent ""slight"" remittance is stated, ensuring precise coding."
411670000,Coriandrum sativum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Coriander diagnostic allergen extract—Coriandrum sativum,"The phrase provides both common and Latin names and specifies a diagnostic allergen extract, corresponding to the product concept 411670000. Main concept: diagnostic allergen extract product; no added attributes like administration or results are included. Category: Product. Parent concepts without allergen specificity and sibling therapeutic extracts are not appropriate given the diagnostic qualifier and named species. Word order and punctuation are stylistic, preserving the exact semantic content."
16848141000119103,History of primary non-small cell carcinoma of right lung (situation),Patient-stated: had primary non-small cell carcinoma in my right lung before,"This patient-reported phrasing conveys a prior history of primary non-small cell carcinoma in the right lung. It specifies NSCLC histology, lung site, right laterality, and past context, making it a Situation with explicit context. The specific concept for history of primary NSCLC in the right lung is the exact code match. Parent concepts (e.g., history of lung cancer) are too broad, and siblings altering laterality or histology do not fit. The conversational wording is a valid synonym preserving the same clinical meaning without adding attributes."
223711006,Trinidad and Tobago (geographic location),Trinidad and Tobago (country),"The parenthetical clarifier 'country' reinforces the semantic type but does not alter the concept. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). This remains a direct reference to the national geographic location and matches SCTID 223711006 precisely. Broader parents (e.g., 'Country' in general) are too nonspecific, while children like 'Trinidad' or 'Tobago' are too specific. No sibling concept better fits the wording."
465422008,Suture retention device (physical object),Retention suture retainer,"This entry reiterates the device’s function—retaining retention sutures—while remaining semantically equivalent to Suture retention device (physical object) SCTID 465422008. Category: Physical object. No procedural or patient context is introduced. A broader parent device concept would be insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts (e.g., anchoring devices, sutures themselves) have different clinical roles and would not be as precise."
370914009,Death or serious disability (kernicterus) associated with failure to identify and treat hyperbilirubinemia in neonates (event),Family statement: our newborn suffered kernicterus after high bilirubin was not identified or treated,"This entry captures a patient/family-reported safety event: kernicterus (serious disability) following failure to identify and treat elevated bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia) in a newborn. The main concept is an Event focused on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia not being identified or treated and the resulting kernicterus or death; here the serious disability component is explicitly kernicterus. The SNOMED CT category is Event, matching SCTID 370914009. A disorder code for kernicterus would miss the association with the safety failure. The term “high bilirubin” is a plain-language equivalent to hyperbilirubinemia, preserving the intended coding scope without adding attributes."
410466006,Indirect retroillumination from retina (qualifier value),Indirect retroillumination from retina utilized,"This statement denotes utilization of the illumination method 'indirect retroillumination from retina,' which is a Qualifier value for technique and matches SCTID 410466006. A parent concept lacking 'indirect' or a sibling that specifies 'direct' would not capture the intended modality. The synonym 'utilized' merely reflects method use and does not add clinical attributes beyond the qualifier."
256384003,Red cells - supplemented - buffy coat removed - irradiated (product),Buffy-coat–removed irradiated red cells in additive solution,"This phrase states red cells that are in additive solution (supplemented), with the buffy coat removed, and irradiated. The main concept is a blood product, fitting the SNOMED CT Product category, and it maps precisely to SCTID 256384003. Parent items such as irradiated red cells without buffy coat removal or supplementation are overly general. Siblings like leukocyte-depleted or washed red cells are not implied by the wording. 'In additive solution' is a clinically equivalent expression for 'supplemented' in RBC products."
258110002,Saline method (qualifier value),Saline technique used,"The statement indicates that the technique utilized was saline, which aligns with Saline method (qualifier value), SCTID 258110002 under Qualifier value. It maintains the focus on method without introducing specific procedures or concentrations. Parent concepts like “Method” are too generic, while child or sibling qualifiers implying different methods or specific saline formulations would add attributes not present in this wording. The term “technique” is an acceptable synonym for “method” in SNOMED context."
309276007,Frozen section urinary bladder specimen (specimen),Urinary bladder frozen section specimen,"The phrase specifies a pathology specimen from the urinary bladder that has been prepared as a frozen section. The main concepts are the anatomical source (urinary bladder) and the preparation method (frozen section), making this a SNOMED CT Specimen category entry. SCTID 309276007 (Frozen section urinary bladder specimen) is the precise match because it combines both the site and the frozen section preparation. Broader parents like “Urinary bladder specimen” omit the frozen section technique, and “Frozen section specimen” omits the anatomical site. Sibling or child concepts that mention biopsy, tumor, margin, or urine would add attributes not present here, so they are less appropriate."
723985005,Nusinersen (substance),"Record notes the substance ""nusinersen""","The documentation statement identifies nusinersen as a substance without asserting use, dose, route, or brand. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Therefore, Nusinersen (substance) SCTID 723985005 is the precise match; parent classes or product codes would introduce attributes not stated in the text."
1365765001,Parent has alcohol use disorder (situation),Parent diagnosed with alcohol use disorder,"This phrasing conveys that a parent carries the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, without adding severity, chronicity, or specifying which parent. It belongs to the Situation with explicit context hierarchy, and 1365765001 is the most accurate match because it captures the parent relationship and the disorder. Choosing a parent-specific child code (mother or father) would not be supported by the wording, and picking a general family history code would be imprecise. ‘Diagnosed with’ is a clinically acceptable paraphrase of ‘has’ and does not change the code selection."
63817004,Amphetamine measurement (procedure),Amphetamine concentration quantified,"Quantifying concentration explicitly describes measurement of amphetamine, placing this in the Procedure category. It maps to Amphetamine measurement (63817004). The statement does not specify sample type or method, so child concepts are excluded, and it is not a screening/detection concept, keeping it distinct from siblings."
276237000,Comments on own reading (finding),Comments on own reading,"The main concept stated is the existence of comments pertaining to the individual's own reading, with no mention of the reading type or any interpretation, timing, or cause. This aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 276237000, a Clinical finding that captures patient-provided commentary about their self-recorded reading. More general parent findings (e.g., generic comment/findings) would be less specific, and children or siblings that reference a particular measurement domain (such as blood pressure or glucose) are not appropriate because no specific modality is named. The phrasing uses the preferred term directly, ensuring precise mapping without added attributes."
710459003,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (substance),Anti–Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 immunoglobulin G,"The term expresses an antibody (anti–) and specifies immunoglobulin G targeting HIV-1, mapping to the Substance SCTID 710459003. It does not add method, result, or subclass attributes. More general 'anti–HIV-1 antibody' (no isotype) would be a parent; variants indicating other isotypes or HIV-2 are siblings and not equivalent to the stated content."
702908005,Pediatric urology clinic (environment),Pediatric urology clinic setting,"Adding “setting” clarifies that this is an environment of care rather than a service or department, pointing specifically to the pediatric urology clinic. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This matches 702908005 exactly. Concepts that represent services, departments, wards, or encounters are inappropriate because the wording focuses solely on the location of care."
309904001,Intensive care unit (environment),Patient located in the intensive care unit,"The statement situates the patient in the ICU, emphasizing the environment/location. It maps to SNOMED CT 309904001 (Environment or geographical location). It does not assert admission or transfer as procedures, nor does it specify specialized ICU types, avoiding child/sibling concepts. Parent concepts like hospital ward are too broad; the ICU environment code is the best fit for the expressed location."
223594002,Thailand (geographic location),Thailand (geopolitical location),"Thailand is specified with the descriptor 'geopolitical location,' which correctly characterizes a sovereign nation without introducing additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). This is a synonymic characterization and does not point to nationality, language, or events. Parent categories like Geographic location or Country are broader, and no more granular child concepts or alternative sibling countries are referenced. SCTID 223594002 is the most accurate code."
224014004,British Columbia (geographic location),Geographic location: British Columbia,"This entry names British Columbia and frames it expressly as a geographic location, aligning with the SNOMED location hierarchy. Main concept: British Columbia; attribute: label 'geographic location' (contextual descriptor only). SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The best match is SCTID 224014004; broader parents (generic geographic location) lack specificity, and children (e.g., Vancouver) or siblings (e.g., Alberta) would be incorrect. The wording is a neutral descriptor, not introducing a different coded concept."
119298005,Mixed venous blood specimen (specimen),Mixed venous blood sample obtained,"This confirms the existence of a mixed venous blood specimen and remains within the Specimen category. The wording aligns with SCTID 119298005, with 'sample' being an acceptable synonym for 'specimen.' No collection site, test type, or other attributes are introduced. Parent concepts (venous blood) lack the mixed qualifier, and sibling concepts (arterial or central venous) are not reflected, supporting the exact match."
445356005,Aragonese language (qualifier value),Lengua aragonesa,"This is another Spanish synonym meaning 'Aragonese language', which points directly to the SNOMED CT qualifier value for the language. The entry does not imply ability, preference, or service requirements, making the precise concept the language value. Generic parent 'Language' is too broad, and sibling languages would be incorrect. The wording is an accepted synonym that does not alter the coding intent."
332307000,Entire middle third of shaft of bone (body structure),Complete mid-diaphyseal third region,"The term 'mid-diaphyseal third' is equivalent to 'middle third of the diaphysis,' and 'complete' denotes the entire segment. Main concept: anatomical site at the bone shaft. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 332307000 captures this exact middle third extent. Parent concepts (diaphysis) are too broad; proximal/distal third siblings would misrepresent the location; no specific bone or laterality is added."
440674008,Specimen obtained by lavage (specimen),Lavage washings (specimen),"This description refers to washings produced via lavage, designated as a specimen. No anatomical source, severity, timing, or test detail is provided. Category: Specimen. SCTID 440674008 best represents this, as it specifically covers specimens obtained by lavage. Using a generic specimen code would omit the essential method, while selecting site-specific child concepts would add unsupported detail. 'Washings' is a clinical synonym for lavage, maintaining semantic equivalence without altering the code."
304962001,Structure of ulnar collateral ligament of proximal interphalangeal joint of little finger (body structure),Target anatomy: ulnar collateral ligament of the PIP joint of the fifth digit,"This entry names the anatomical target as the ulnar collateral ligament at the PIP joint of the fifth digit (synonym of little finger), aligning with SCTID 304962001. The main concept is the ligament structure; attributes include joint (PIP) and digit (fifth digit). The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The 'target anatomy' context does not introduce a condition or procedure, keeping the focus on the structure. Broader parents or siblings (radial collateral ligaments or other digit/joint locations) would not fit the exact wording."
729903009,Entire multilaminar epithelium (body structure),Pathology section contains the entire multilaminar epithelium,"The concept being documented is the presence of the full multilaminar epithelium within a pathology section, which still denotes the anatomical structure itself. Category: Body structure. This maps to SCTID 729903009 since it references the complete multilayered epithelium and does not introduce site, subtype, or disease. Parents like general epithelium lack the multilaminar constraint; specific stratified subtypes would add unspoken detail. The context of inclusion in a section does not change the structure coded."
183195002,Active wrist extension splint (physical object),Splint for active wrist extension,"This entry describes a splint with the purpose of active wrist extension, maintaining the same device identity without adding attributes. Category: Physical object. The prepositional phrase 'for active wrist extension' preserves the specificity required for SCTID 183195002. A parent concept such as 'splint' or 'wrist splint' lacks this functional detail, and sibling devices like braces or passive extension splints are not indicated by this wording."
84519007,Townsend's solitaire (organism),Photographic ID: Townsend's solitaire,"This describes identification via a photo and names the species Townsend's solitaire, which is an organism. The identification context does not add clinical attributes; it simply confirms the species. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism concept SCTID 84519007. Parent concepts like generic 'Bird' are less specific, and sibling species would not match the named organism. Hence, 84519007 is the most appropriate code."
734919008,Brief Parental Self-efficacy Scale score (observable entity),Brief Parental Self-efficacy Scale questionnaire score,"Adding 'questionnaire' clarifies the instrument type but keeps the focus on the score produced by the Brief Parental Self-efficacy Scale. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, mapped precisely by SCTID 734919008. This is not the administration procedure or the instrument concept; it is the score observable. Parent concepts would be generalized self-efficacy scores, and sibling concepts would be scores from other parenting questionnaires, which are not indicated here."
224874005,Adult training center (environment),Class held at the adult training center,"This indicates activity occurring in the environment, explicitly an adult training center. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. Mentioning a class does not change the place type; it supports SCTID 224874005 rather than mapping to a broader educational institution."
609306004,Microscopic cytologic examination of specimen from urinary bladder (procedure),Bladder cytology microscopic examination,"The phrase explicitly indicates microscopic examination within the context of bladder cytology, tying the procedure to a bladder-derived specimen. Main concept: microscopic cytologic exam of bladder specimen. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It matches SCTID 609306004, differing from generic urine cytology and histologic procedures. The wording is a rearrangement of equivalent terms and retains the same procedural meaning."
24490001,Lyconema barbatum (organism),Pathology addendum – organism: Lyconema barbatum,"In a pathology addendum, the organism indicated is Lyconema barbatum, which identifies the species. The concept to code is the organism species, falling under the SNOMED CT Organism category with SCTID 24490001. The context does not add any diagnostic attributes or suggest a different taxonomic rank. Parent genus or sibling species would be inaccurate, and no strain or subspecies is specified. Therefore, the species-level organism concept is the appropriate and most precise code."
108590002,Fenoldopam (substance),"Fenoldopam, active moiety","Describing fenoldopam as the active moiety identifies the core chemical entity, appropriately mapped to Fenoldopam (substance) SCTID 108590002 within the Substance hierarchy. The wording does not add dosage, route, or salt information, so product concepts or salt-specific substances (e.g., mesylate) would be less accurate. Parent classes are too general for this precise naming."
733685000,D-2-hydroxyglutarate (substance),D-2-hydroxyglutarate anion,"This entry denotes the ionic (glutarate) form of the D-2-hydroxyglutarate molecule, which is exactly what the term 'glutarate' implies in chemical nomenclature. No extraneous attributes such as concentration, specimen, or clinical significance are included. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The best match is SNOMED CT concept 733685000, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (substance). Concepts referring to the acid (protonated) form would be siblings and therefore less appropriate. Parent concepts without stereochemical specification do not capture the D enantiomer detail. The use of 'anion' is consistent with the glutarate designation and does not change the substance identity, maintaining precise alignment with the code."
1363043009,Beta angle of left hip (observable entity),Left hip β angle (Graf),"The term highlights the beta angle of the left hip and notes the Graf context, which is synonymous with the standard definition of beta angle. Category: Observable entity. The Graf mention does not add attributes beyond the established parameter and supports SCTID 1363043009. Parent observables without laterality are less specific, and siblings (Graf alpha angle left hip; Graf beta angle right hip) differ in angle or side."
728542009,Entire middle third of shaft of rib (body structure),Entire middle third of body of rib,"In anatomical usage, 'body of rib' is synonymous with 'shaft of rib.' The phrase indicates the entire middle third of that body/shaft. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This is equivalent to SCTID 728542009. Parents such as 'body of rib' are too general; siblings (proximal/distal thirds) do not match; and children specifying rib number or laterality are not suggested by the text. No non-anatomical attributes are present."
396551005,Femur length (observable entity),Bone length — femur,"This phrasing states the bone length attribute and specifies the bone as femur, indicating the observable entity without adding laterality, age stage, or measurement results. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It maps to Femur length rather than broader parent categories (e.g., bone length unspecified) or sibling bones (e.g., tibia length). The formatting does not imply a procedure; it denotes the attribute itself."
262080003,Strain RM 2 (qualifier value),Strain RM 2,"The entry explicitly names the strain designation RM 2 as the sole concept. This is a SNOMED CT Qualifier value, and the most precise match is Strain RM 2 (262080003). It does not introduce any organism, disease, severity, or other attributes—just the strain label. Using the parent concept “Strain (qualifier value)” would be less specific, and any sibling strain (e.g., RM 1 or RM 3) would be incorrect. The wording matches the preferred term exactly, ensuring unambiguous coding to 262080003."
703110003,Benproperine (substance),Benproperine (standalone substance entry),"This indicates that Benproperine is recorded purely as a substance entry, not as a product or formulation. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The most precise match is SCTID 703110003, as no salt (e.g., phosphate) or product attributes are included, avoiding parent or child mappings."
764138006,Product containing muscarinic receptor agonist (product),Pharmaceutical product containing a muscarinic receptor agonist,"The entry explicitly states a pharmaceutical product that contains a muscarinic receptor agonist. This is clearly a product category and not a clinical finding or procedure. SNOMED CT 764138006 is the most exact match because it captures products defined by inclusion of muscarinic receptor agonists, without specifying single-ingredient-only or particular drug names. Broader parents (e.g., any pharmaceutical product) fail to capture the mechanism-of-action class, and narrower children (specific named agonist products) overspecify what the entry leaves general."
284893000,Ability to apply own make-up (observable entity),Ability to put on own makeup,"This entry uses the common expression 'put on' to mean apply makeup and maintains the focus on the individual's ability to do so themselves. It represents an Observable entity and aligns with SCTID 284893000. No qualitative assessment or status is included. Broader grooming ability concepts would be insufficiently specific, and sibling activities (e.g., nail care) are different tasks. The paraphrase 'put on' is a clinically safe synonym for 'apply' and does not change the code."
169584000,Antenatal care: poor obstetric history (situation),Antenatal care problem list item—poor obstetric history,"The phrase places poor obstetric history explicitly as a problem-list item within an antenatal care context. The combined meaning is a care situation annotated with poor obstetric history, without further detail. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 169584000 is exact because it codes antenatal care with poor obstetric history. Coding to Poor obstetric history (finding) alone would fail to capture the antenatal care context, and Antenatal care alone would miss the qualifier. The problem-list framing does not change the underlying situation."
448573007,World Health Organization histological classification of lung and pleural tumors (qualifier value),Protocol requires WHO lung and pleural tumor histology classification,"The protocol statement points to the WHO histology-based classification specific to lung and pleural tumors, a Qualifier value captured by 448573007. Using other systems (e.g., IASLC staging) would be mismatched qualifiers, and limiting to lung alone would be too narrow compared with the concept’s defined scope."
364053008,Characteristic of respiratory tract function (observable entity),Data element: characteristic of respiratory tract function,"The addition of 'Data element:' signals documentation context but does not modify the underlying concept, which is an observable characteristic of respiratory tract function. No attribute values, results, or conditions are stated. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This mapping aligns with SCTID 364053008; parent entities like broader respiratory system function or child observables like specific airway measures are not indicated. The contextual prefix does not change clinical meaning or code selection."
53995007,Structure of superficial peroneal nerve (body structure),Superficial fibular nerve,"This phrasing uses the clinically accepted synonym 'fibular' for 'peroneal', referring to the same anatomical structure. The main medical concept is the nerve itself as an anatomical entity. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, corresponding to SCTID 53995007. The synonym does not introduce any new attributes; it is a naming variation only. Parents such as 'structure of fibular nerve' are broader, and siblings like 'deep fibular (peroneal) nerve' denote different nerves; therefore the specific 'superficial' designation makes this code the most accurate."
1137705008,Assessment of quality of life declined (situation),QoL evaluation declined,"The content states that a QoL evaluation was declined, equivalent to refusing the quality-of-life assessment. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Situation concept SCTID 1137705008. The use of “evaluation” is a clinically valid synonym for assessment and does not change the code selection. It avoids mapping to concepts about performing or interpreting QoL results, making this the most precise match."
10154005,Salvelinus namaycush (organism),Salvelinus namaycush,"The entry states the exact scientific binomial for lake trout, which directly denotes the organism concept. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 10154005 corresponds specifically to Salvelinus namaycush, making this the most precise match. No additional attributes (e.g., exposure, severity, timing) are introduced; it is simply the species name. More general parents such as the genus Salvelinus or the family Salmonidae would be less precise, and siblings like Salvelinus alpinus (Arctic char) are excluded by the explicit species epithet. Therefore, the organism concept Salvelinus namaycush is the correct code selection."
59701000119109,History of portal hypertension (situation),Problem list (history): portal hypertension,"This formulation clearly puts portal hypertension on a historical problem list, indicating past occurrence. Main concept: portal hypertension; attribute: history of. SNOMED category: Situation with explicit context. History of portal hypertension (59701000119109) precisely matches. Active disorder coding would misstate the status, and generic historical problem codes would be less specific."
6051000175105,Hepatitis B vaccination not done (situation),Vaccination for Hepatitis B not provided,"This phrase identifies the target disease (Hepatitis B) and states the vaccination was not provided, indicating non-administration. The main concept is Hepatitis B vaccination with non-performance status, which is a Situation. SCTID 6051000175105 is the precise match, encoding the non-performance of the specific vaccination without reason or timing details. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts that add cause or indicate administration would not fit the wording. 'Not provided' is a valid synonym for 'not done'."
422106007,Add - dosing instruction fragment (qualifier value),Qualifier value (dosing verb): Add,"This explicitly identifies “Add” as a qualifier value functioning as a dosing verb. Category: Qualifier value. It precisely matches SNOMED CT 422106007 because it names the verb fragment and its semantic type. It avoids any attributes such as what or how to add. Parent concepts like “dosing instruction fragment” are not specific to the verb, and sibling verbs represent different actions. The parenthetical clarifies role without changing meaning."
223842005,Azores (geographic location),Azores islands,"This entry uses a synonym describing Azores as a group of islands, which is clinically equivalent to naming the archipelago. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). Azores (geographic location), SCTID 223842005, fits best because it designates the entire island group without naming a single island (which would be a child concept) or a wider region (which would be a parent). Sibling island groups are not referenced, preserving specificity."
1163453000,Structure of interphalangeal joint of left great toe (body structure),Imaging target: left big toe IP joint,"The entry identifies the left big toe interphalangeal joint as the imaging target. The main concept is the anatomical structure of the left hallux IP joint. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches SCTID 1163453000 and excludes broader or different joints. The synonym “big toe” is equivalent to great toe/hallux and, paired with “IP,” preserves specificity without introducing extra attributes."
49865003,Structure of shaft of phalanx of little toe (body structure),Exam reference: shaft of the phalanx of the little toe,"The core concept remains the shaft (diaphysis) of a phalanx in the little toe, with 'Exam reference' serving only as contextual framing. It is a Body structure and aligns precisely with SCTID 49865003. The wording does not add specificity to proximal/middle/distal phalanx, avoiding child concepts, and it is narrower than parents that omit the little toe. There are no added diagnostic or temporal attributes, so the code selection is exact."
224064006,Maine (geographic location),Maine (geographic location),"The entry explicitly labels Maine as a geographic location, matching the SNOMED concept verbatim. The main concept is Maine, the U.S. state. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). This is an exact alignment to code 224064006. More general parents (e.g., 'United States of America') or siblings (other U.S. states) do not fit the specific place named. No additional attributes are present; the parenthetical simply restates the hierarchy type and does not change the code selection."
2619005,Psychiatric interpretation to family or parents of patient (procedure),Psychiatric interpretation briefing for parents,"This entry describes a briefing that conveys psychiatric interpretation to the parents. Attributes: psychiatric interpretive content; recipients = parents. Category: Procedure. SCTID 2619005 is most accurate because it denotes psychiatric interpretation to family/parents. More general briefing or counseling concepts are too broad, while sibling concepts such as psychoeducation or therapy introduce modalities not present. The term “briefing” indicates the communication format but remains equivalent to an interpretive delivery without adding time, severity, or other attributes."
363549008,Sulfone (substance),Imaging report mentions the compound class: sulfone,"Within an imaging report, the phrase only references the compound class 'sulfone' and does not assert use as a contrast agent or product. Therefore, it should be coded as the Substance concept Sulfone (substance) SCTID 363549008. Product-containing or contrast-related codes would add attributes not present. Parent classes are too general, and named child sulfones are not specified. Siblings (e.g., sulfonamides) represent different chemistry."
466010005,Balance/mobility management system application software (physical object),Software application for the balance/mobility management system,"The entry explicitly states it is a software application tied to a balance/mobility management system, which fits the Physical object category. It does not introduce timing, brand, usage, or function beyond the system domain. This is more specific than general Application software and does not suggest a different child such as fall risk assessment or gait analysis components. Thus, it directly corresponds to Balance/mobility management system application software."
411603002,Pigeon droppings diagnostic allergen extract (product),Pigeon droppings allergen extract for diagnostic testing,"The phrase specifies an allergen extract from pigeon droppings and its diagnostic testing use, clearly a Product. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED 411603002. A parent concept would omit the source; therapeutic extracts (siblings) are not implied; and findings like 'pigeon droppings allergy' are distinct categories. The wording introduces no severity, timing, or method attributes, maintaining precise mapping."
256889002,Breast cyst fluid specimen (specimen),Patient statement: they took a breast cyst fluid sample,"Despite patient-centered phrasing, the content identifies that a sample (specimen) of breast cyst fluid was taken, which corresponds to the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 'Breast cyst fluid specimen'. The wording does not add attributes like side, timing, or method. It is more specific than general breast fluid and does not imply other materials, making the concept an exact match."
176045001,Tapering of ureter (procedure),Ureter tapering surgery,"The entry specifies surgery whose purpose is tapering of the ureter; the category is Procedure. This is a direct expression of “Tapering of ureter (procedure).” A general ‘ureter repair’ or ‘ureteroplasty’ would be too broad, while procedures like reimplantation or endoscopic dilation are different. The wording avoids laterality, timing, etiology, or adjunct procedures, and ‘surgery’ simply clarifies the procedural nature without altering the concept."
223750005,Sumatera (geographic location),Family lives in Sumatra,"This note references Sumatra as the location where the patient's family resides, emphasizing the geographic entity. The SNOMED CT category is Location, with the best fit being Sumatera (geographic location), SCTID 223750005. No provincial or national qualifiers are present, so child or parent concepts do not apply. The English variant 'Sumatra' is an accepted synonym that maintains the same island concept."
108966005,Product containing colony stimulating factor (product),Med list entry: colony stimulating factor,"This indicates a medication list entry naming a colony-stimulating factor product, with no detail on subtype, dose, route, or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product, mapping to SCTID 108966005. 'Med list entry' sets context but the coded concept is the product type itself. It does not specify a particular CSF such as G-CSF or GM-CSF (which would require a child code) and is more precise than parent categories like generic hematopoietic agents. Therefore, the product containing colony stimulating factor is the exact match."
700840004,Swivel-walker (physical object),Swivel-walker apparatus,"Using “apparatus” is a generic descriptor that maintains the identity of the device as a swivel-walker. The category is Physical object. SCTID 700840004 is appropriate because the core concept is the swivel-walker; broader parents like walker lack the swivel specificity, and sibling devices like rollators are different designs. No features, size, or usage attributes are added by “apparatus.”"
61648004,"Structure of full term fetus, age 36-42 weeks (body structure)",Full-term fetal anatomy (36–42 wk),"This entry describes the anatomical entity of the fetus and specifies the term gestational window of 36–42 weeks. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. 'Fetal anatomy' is an anatomical phrasing equivalent to 'fetal structure', and 'full-term' directly corresponds to the same concept; the parent 'Fetal structure' would be too general without age. Sibling concepts such as 'Term neonate' or 'Term pregnancy' represent different entities (neonate or maternal condition). No additional attributes (e.g., viability, anomalies) are introduced, so the exact code for the structure of a full-term fetus is appropriate."
439030002,High riding prostate (finding),Prostate palpation: high-riding,"The entry states the palpation result as ‘high-riding,’ directly conveying a high-riding prostate positional Clinical finding. The precise SNOMED CT match is 439030002 High riding prostate (finding). Method context (‘palpation’) does not add extraneous attributes. Broader parental findings would be less precise, and sibling conditions like enlargement or tenderness differ from positional findings. Using ‘high-riding’ maintains exact equivalence with the preferred term."
262151005,Sinusoidal waveform (qualifier value),Waveform shape: sinusoidal,"This entry provides a morphology attribute ('shape') and specifies it as sinusoidal, exactly matching Sinusoidal waveform (262151005). The main concept is a form descriptor for a waveform. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It is more precise than a general 'waveform shape' parent and not consistent with sibling shapes such as square or triangular. The phrasing does not add clinical context or modifiers, ensuring the qualifier value is the right selection."
223356001,Anguilla (geographic location),Anguilla—toponym used.,"Calling Anguilla a toponym underscores it as a geographic name, which aligns with Anguilla (geographic location), SCTID 223356001. No attributes such as timing, residence, or travel are present. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The entry does not generalize or specify beyond the territory; parents or children are not suggested. ‘Toponym’ is a descriptive synonym that maintains concept equivalence."
224889001,Toilet on hospital premises (environment),Found in the toilet at the hospital,"This phrase identifies the environmental location as the toilet at the hospital, indicating hospital premises. The best match is SNOMED CT 224889001, Toilet on hospital premises (environment). The wording does not add event type, timing, or specific unit details, keeping it purely environmental. Parent concepts would lose either the toilet or hospital context, and children specifying departments or special facilities would be too granular. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the concept."
224043007,California (geographic location),Imaging site: California,"This entry marks California as the imaging site location; the codable concept is the geographic place California. Main concept: California, geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Use code 224043007. The imaging context does not imply a different geographic entity, and there is no specification of a city or region; thus parent or child concepts would be less accurate."
242453005,Accident caused by fumes from burning polyvinyl chloride in conflagration in commercial premises (event),Assessment: accident caused by fumes from burning PVC in the setting of a conflagration in commercial premises,"This assessment reflects an accident event with cause (fumes from burning PVC) and context (conflagration in commercial premises). Category: Event. 'In the setting of a conflagration' is equivalent to 'during conflagration' and does not alter the concept. The exact combination matches 242453005. Parent concepts lacking the commercial setting or conflagration, and sibling concepts involving other materials, are less accurate."
444491009,Exposure to viral hepatitis (event),Intake note: exposure to viral hepatitis,"The intake context frames the documentation, but the medical concept is an exposure event to viral hepatitis, with no mention of subtype, route, or outcomes. The category is Event. The best code is SNOMED CT 444491009. Parents like 'Exposure to infectious disease' are too generalized; children specifying hepatitis A/B/C exposures are too specific. Sibling concepts such as 'History of exposure' or 'Risk of viral hepatitis' would misrepresent the entry, which directly asserts an exposure event."
263926003,Very slow (qualifier value),Very slow reported,"The main coded concept is the value “very slow,” with ‘reported’ as a context marker. Category: Qualifier value. It aligns with 263926003 as it denotes the intensified slowness. Parent/sibling qualifiers are inappropriate: “Slow” is insufficiently intense; “Fast/Very fast” contradict the text. The entry avoids introducing specifics about cause, timing, or what is slow, preserving the pure qualifier."
827056004,Serving (qualifier value),Reported in servings,"The entry indicates reporting uses the unit 'servings' as a qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 827056004 accurately represents 'serving' as the qualifier unit. Using a generic parent would lose specificity, and sibling qualifier units (e.g., 'cup') would be incorrect. The wording avoids quantity, frequency, or size, ensuring this does not map to 'serving size' or any observable entity."
40863000,Moderate duration loss of consciousness (finding),Patient reports a moderate-duration loss of consciousness,"This patient-reported phrase clearly indicates loss of consciousness and qualifies it as moderate in duration. As a Clinical finding, it maps specifically to 'Moderate duration loss of consciousness (finding)' (SCTID: 40863000). The parent concept lacking the duration qualifier would be less specific, and choosing brief/short or prolonged siblings would be inconsistent with 'moderate-duration.' No cause, severity, or timing beyond the duration category is provided, keeping the selection tightly aligned to 40863000."
432140002,Specimen from bronchus obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Fine needle aspiration biopsy specimen—bronchus—received,"This entry represents a received specimen with clear site (bronchus) and method (fine needle aspiration biopsy). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It precisely matches SCTID 432140002. More general parents would omit the technique, while related siblings (e.g., brush biopsy from bronchus) or different sites (e.g., trachea) would be inaccurate. The language avoids attributes beyond site and method, ensuring no drift into child concepts that add specificity like laterality or guidance."
408994004,Adult care assessment (procedure),Adult care assessment for an adult patient,"This phrasing clarifies population (adult) without adding other attributes, and the activity is an assessment Procedure. It aligns exactly with Adult care assessment (procedure). Parent concepts like Care assessment are too broad, and siblings referring to children or specific subdomains (e.g., social care) are not indicated."
788683005,Structure of L3 spinal nerve proper (body structure),Operative field includes the L3 spinal nerve proper,"Within surgical context, the named anatomy is the L3 spinal nerve proper, with no procedural or pathologic attributes added. Main concept: L3 spinal nerve proper. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The wording points to SCTID 788683005; parents are insufficiently specific, and child/sibling entities (roots/rami) would incorrectly narrow or shift the anatomical target."
309974000,Oral surgery department (environment),Pathology specimen originated from the Oral Surgery Department,"This notes the originating environment for a specimen as the oral surgery department. Category: Environment or geographical location. It corresponds to SCTID 309974000, directly naming the department. It does not suggest a clinic, unit, ward, or expanded maxillofacial scope, making broader parents and sibling concepts less appropriate for the exact phrasing."
1156608003,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of liver at parenchymal surgical margin in liver tissue specimen (observable entity),Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of liver at parenchymal surgical margin in liver tissue specimen,"The entry explicitly names the observable variable: whether a primary malignant neoplasm of the liver is present at the parenchymal surgical margin in a liver tissue specimen. Attributes stated include the target disease (primary malignant neoplasm of liver), anatomical margin (parenchymal surgical margin), and specimen type (liver tissue). This fits SNOMED CT category Observable entity and aligns exactly with SCTID 1156608003. It does not assert a result (positive/negative), so it remains the data element rather than a finding. A more general parent like “Presence of malignant neoplasm at surgical margin” is less precise because it omits liver primary and margin type; a child or sibling specifying a particular tumor subtype (e.g., HCC only) or a different margin (e.g., bile duct margin) would be inappropriate. The wording is the preferred term and thus clinically equivalent."
223689009,Central American country (geographic location),Country (Central America),"This concise, bracketed phrasing indicates a country in the Central America region, which corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 223689009 (Geographic location). The parent 'Country (geographic location)' would be too general, and regional concepts like 'Central America' are not precise because they denote a region rather than a country. It avoids naming any specific nation, thus not invoking child concepts. No additional attributes are present."
1296499001,Wohlfahrtiimonas larvae (organism),Genus-species: Wohlfahrtiimonas larvae,"This entry conveys the binomial (genus and species) identification of the organism, Wohlfahrtiimonas larvae, without clinical qualifiers. It maps directly to the Organism concept 1296499001. The phrase does not indicate detection or disease, precluding finding/disorder mappings. Parent terms at genus or higher levels would be overly broad."
115832006,JkJk phenotype (finding),Kidd null phenotype (JkJk),"The entry describes the Kidd null phenotype and explicitly ties it to the JkJk designation, which is the standard way to denote this phenotype. It is a Clinical finding; the inclusion of 'JkJk' ensures precise mapping to SNOMED CT 115832006. Using 'Kidd null' here serves as an accepted synonym for the JkJk phenotype and does not introduce additional attributes. Parent Kidd phenotype categories are too general, and other Kidd phenotypes are incorrect for this wording."
2431000181102,Arterial plasma specimen (specimen),Arterial plasma specimen noted,"This entry states that an arterial plasma specimen has been noted, clearly indicating plasma material and arterial origin. Category: Specimen. The exact SNOMED CT concept is Arterial plasma specimen (2431000181102). A parent like Plasma specimen omits source specificity, and sibling concepts change either source or fraction. The wording maintains the concept without adding unrelated attributes."
411918004,Liquidambar styraciflua specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),American sweetgum allergen extract for diagnostic testing,"The entry specifies an allergen extract from American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) used for diagnostic testing, maintaining species specificity and diagnostic purpose. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This is a precise match for SCTID 411918004. Parent concepts omit species, and any sibling for other species or immunotherapy extracts would be incorrect. The use of the common name remains clinically equivalent to the botanical name."
305338009,Admission to general practice hospital (procedure),Admission to the general practice hospital facility,"This entry specifies admission to a facility that is a general practice hospital, matching the procedural concept. Main concept: hospital admission; facility type: general practice hospital; category: Procedure. The explicit facility type prevents mapping to the generic 'Admission to hospital' or other facility-based siblings. No extra qualifiers are introduced, making SCTID 305338009 the precise selection."
346457008,Gluten-free other foods (product),Registration flag: Gluten-free other edible foods,"The primary concept is “gluten-free other edible foods,” where “edible foods” reiterates food items and “other” denotes the miscellaneous category within gluten-free products. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This matches Gluten-free other foods by specifying a non-specific grouping of gluten-free products, without adding any attributes such as packaging, preparation, or clinical indication. The parent concept encompassing all gluten-free foods would be overly broad, and a child/sibling like gluten-free beverages would be too narrow. The registration flag context is administrative and does not change the product semantics or code selection."
257673008,Domestic walkway (environment),Scene described as the domestic walkway,"This note describes the scene as a domestic walkway, with no added details beyond the environment. The main concept is the residential walkway location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. Using ""scene"" is contextual and does not change the underlying concept; it remains domestic walkway. More specific or alternative environments (hallway, porch, public sidewalk) are not implied and would be less accurate choices."
223575007,Mongolia (geographic location),Employer location: Mongolia,"The phrase assigns Mongolia as an employer’s location, functioning as a geographic place without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location), corresponding to SCTID 223575007. No narrower locale within Mongolia is named, and no other country or region is implied, ruling out child or sibling concepts. The contextual label does not change the underlying location concept."
363311008,Specimen from digestive system (specimen),Operative note: specimen labeled 'digestive system',"The operative documentation indicates the specimen’s label identifies the digestive system as its origin. No additional specificity (organ, tract segment, or specimen type) is provided. Category: Specimen. This aligns with SNOMED CT 363311008 'Specimen from digestive system (specimen)'. Parents like 'Specimen' omit anatomical source, and children such as 'Specimen from stomach' or 'Specimen from liver' would be incorrect given the non-specific system-level wording."
84768009,Train derailment (event),Railway train derailment,"This entry clearly specifies a derailment involving a railway train, aligning directly with the train derailment event. It avoids adding information on cause, location, or consequences. The exact SNOMED CT match is Train derailment (event), SCTID 84768009, categorized as an Event. Selecting broader rail accident codes would reduce specificity, and other rail events like collisions are not suggested. The synonym explicitly retains the train derailment meaning and is thus appropriate for the same code."
249293005,Strength of stream of urine (observable entity),Questionnaire item: strength of urine stream,"The entry represents a patient-reported assessment item about the strength of the urine stream, without specifying any outcome or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It aligns with SCTID 249293005 since the item targets the strength attribute of the urinary stream. Parent concepts are too general, while siblings such as 'Urinary frequency' or 'Flow rate' would be different observables or clinical findings not indicated by this wording."
88522004,Umbilical pain (finding),Pain at the umbilicus,"This phrase describes pain specifically at the umbilicus, which is the defining feature of SNOMED CT 88522004 (Umbilical pain), a Clinical finding. It avoids general abdominal localization and does not introduce broader or adjacent regions, making Abdominal pain or Periumbilical pain inappropriate. No severity, duration, or etiology is stated. The prepositional phrase 'at the umbilicus' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that maintains the same code selection."
427033001,Unit/gram hemoglobin (qualifier value),Per gram hemoglobin (units),"This entry conveys that the unit is measured per gram of hemoglobin, with 'units' explicitly stated. It represents a unit qualifier and fits the Qualifier value category. Parents that do not name hemoglobin are insufficiently specific, and siblings that refer to other denominators or 'IU' introduce different concepts. The wording is a clinically safe paraphrase of the preferred term, so 427033001 is the most precise match."
1352759005,Union for International Cancer Control ycT1c1 (qualifier value),Follow-up note: UICC ycT1c1,"This follow-up documentation contains the exact UICC qualifier ycT1c1 only. The main concept is the UICC TNM post-therapy clinical T subcategory T1c1. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It maps directly to 1352759005. Parent or sibling qualifiers (e.g., ycT1, ycT1c2) would be incorrect. The follow-up context does not change the qualifier value or introduce extra attributes."
126264003,"Human platelets, apheresis, irradiated (product)",Listing: irradiated human platelets from apheresis,"This listing conveys a human platelet product that is derived from apheresis and irradiated; the 'Listing' context does not alter the product semantics. Attributes present are human source, platelet component, apheresis collection method, and irradiation processing. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Blood product). It maps to SCTID 126264003 because it specifies both apheresis and irradiation; parent concepts are too general without these details, and siblings like irradiated pooled platelets misstate the collection method. The phrase is a clear synonymic representation without additional attributes."
174809002,Heterotopic allotransplant of heart (procedure),Surgeon dictation: heterotopic heart allograft implanted,"The dictation describes implantation of a heart allograft in heterotopic position, which is synonymous with a heterotopic allotransplant of the heart. This is a Procedure and corresponds to SCTID 174809002. Parents such as “implantation of heart graft” omit the heterotopic qualifier, and orthotopic or xenograft siblings are not appropriate. The use of “allograft” and “heterotopic” ensures donor type and placement are correctly specified."
369615004,Tissue specimen obtained from extrahepatic bile ducts by choledochal cyst resection (specimen),Pathology: bile duct tissue (extrahepatic) sourced from choledochal cyst resection,"The entry denotes a pathology specimen of tissue from the extrahepatic bile ducts, with procurement clearly by choledochal cyst resection. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This aligns directly to SCTID 369615004 because it includes both the site (extrahepatic bile ducts) and method (choledochal cyst resection). A parent specimen code without the method or a sibling for different sites or acquisition types would be less specific. No extraneous attributes are present."
87267008,"Anti-human globulin test, drug sensitization and identification (procedure)",AHG assay for drug sensitization and identification,"“Assay” appropriately denotes a laboratory procedure here, specifying AHG and its purpose in drug sensitization and identification. The concept category is Procedure. It does not introduce method subtype (DAT/IAT) or outcomes, so it maps better to the named SNOMED concept than to general antiglobulin tests or other related immunohematology procedures. The synonymous phrasing maintains equivalence."
445467007,Three wheeled walking frame (physical object),Tri-wheeled walking frame,"Using 'tri-wheeled' directly states a three-wheel configuration on a walking frame, which is semantically equivalent to 'three-wheeled walking frame.' The concept is a Physical object and maps to SNOMED CT 445467007. Broader parents like walking frame or mobility aid lack specificity, and sibling concepts with different wheel counts would not match. No extraneous attributes (seat, brakes, height adjustability) are included, ensuring the entry stays tightly scoped to the intended device and justifies the precise code."
472940008,Intracranial ventricular catheter submitted as specimen (specimen),Specimen identification: intracranial ventricular catheter,"This is a labeling/identification style entry that designates the specimen as an intracranial ventricular catheter. The main concept is the specimen type. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps directly to 472940008 by specifying a ventricular catheter located intracranially in the context of a specimen. Selecting a broader parent would reduce precision, and choosing a more specific child (e.g., catheter tip) would not be supported by the text. No additional clinical attributes are introduced."
365137003,Finding related to ability to lift (finding),Follow-up note—lifting ability,"This indicates the follow-up documentation includes the clinical finding topic of lifting ability without conveying status. Category: Clinical finding. No specific ability level is stated, so child codes like 'difficulty lifting' or 'able to lift' are not appropriate. A parent concept for general functional follow-up would be broader. The entry remains a neutral finding related to lifting, matching 365137003."
223704007,Grenada (geographic location),Listed country is Grenada,"The entry states Grenada as the listed country, pointing to the sovereign state and matching SNOMED CT Grenada (geographic location), SCTID 223704007. The wording is contextual but does not add attributes like time or travel. Parent or sibling alternatives are not implicated, and no child locations are specified, making the country concept the most precise code."
257706006,Stadium (environment),Documented as stadium,"This entry indicates that the place documented is a stadium and adds no qualities about activity or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and Stadium (environment) [257706006] is the exact match. It is more specific than parent categories like Sports venue and does not suggest a different sibling such as Arena. The phrase 'documented as' is meta-documentation and keeps the concept focused on the stadium environment."
160308005,Family history: Gout (situation),Family hx: gout,"The phrase conveys that gout is present in the patient's family history, which maps to a situation context, not a current patient disorder. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is Family history: Gout (160308005). It does not introduce additional attributes like severity or specific relatives, so narrower child concepts are not warranted. The abbreviation 'hx' is a standard synonym for history and is clinically equivalent without changing code selection."
84637000,Atticoantrostomy of ear (procedure),Procedure performed: Atticoantrostomy of ear,"This documentation-style entry lists the exact procedure performed and corresponds to SNOMED CT 84637000. The category is Procedure. It clearly identifies the specific ear operation and does not introduce attributes like approach, laterality, or indication. More general parent concepts would be insufficiently specific, and different siblings (e.g., atticotomy) would not match the combined attic/antrum opening that defines atticoantrostomy."
224051005,Hawaii island (geographic location),Hawaii (island),"The parenthetical clarifies that the reference is to the island, not the state, allowing unambiguous mapping to SNOMED CT 224051005 (Geographic location). No extra attributes such as travel, residence, or duration are stated. Parent concepts like Hawaii (state) or Hawaiian Islands would be less precise, and child/sibling concepts (specific towns or other islands) are not implied, making the island concept the correct code."
1290740005,Vertical transmission (qualifier value),Mode of spread: vertical,"This wording declares the mode of spread to be vertical, which is parent-to-offspring transmission, without introducing mechanism or timing subtypes. Main concept: vertical transmission mode. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It maps to Vertical transmission (qualifier value) [1290740005]. More general parent modes are too broad, and specific vertical submodes (e.g., breastfeeding) are not identified. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and does not affect code selection."
788184000,Structure of hair follicle of chin (body structure),Chin region hair follicle,"The entry identifies a hair follicle in the chin region, which falls under anatomical Body structure and maps to “Structure of hair follicle of chin” (SCTID: 788184000). The term ‘region’ does not broaden beyond chin and does not introduce new attributes. It is not a better fit for facial hair follicle in general (parent) or for other regional siblings (cheek, lip, jaw). The synonymic phrasing remains equivalent to the preferred concept."
46867005,Salmonella Jericho (organism),Identified serovar: Salmonella Jericho,"This report-style statement specifies the identified serovar as Salmonella Jericho, i.e., the organism. Category: Organism. The best match is Salmonella Jericho (organism) SCTID 46867005; parent taxa are overly broad and sibling serovars are different. The term ‘identified’ provides context but does not change the coded entity or add clinical attributes."
261099005,Intraoral approach (qualifier value),Intraoral surgical approach,"The entry conveys the approach as intraoral in a surgical context, but the term 'surgical' here is contextual rather than adding a distinct attribute; it remains an approach qualifier. The best match is Intraoral approach (qualifier value) 261099005. Parents such as 'Approach' are too broad, and siblings like 'extraoral surgical approach' are excluded by the 'intraoral' descriptor. No child concept more specific than intraoral is implied, and no procedural technique or site beyond the oral cavity is introduced."
216355008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, place for recreation and sport (environment)",Happened at a leisure/sports location,"The phrase indicates that an incident occurred at a location used for leisure or sports, which corresponds to the Environment concept 216355008 (place for recreation and sport). The words “leisure/sports” are synonymous with “recreation and sport” in clinical context and do not introduce new attributes. The entry does not specify a particular venue type, avoiding unintended mapping to a child concept, and is more specific than the broad parent place-of-occurrence category by including the recreation/sport qualifier."
438699005,Streptomyces virens (organism),Reported organism: Streptomyces virens,"The key concept is the organism Streptomyces virens, with 'reported' as neutral context. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most specific code is Streptomyces virens (organism), SCTID 438699005. Mapping to a finding of detection would be inappropriate because the entry centers on the organism name; broader taxa or sibling species would be less precise than the species named."
690481000119102,History of dissection of carotid artery (situation),Medical history includes carotid artery dissection,"This states that carotid artery dissection is part of the patient's medical history, clearly situating it in the past. The main concept is carotid artery dissection with a history attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It maps directly to 'History of dissection of carotid artery' rather than any parent 'history of disease' concepts, and it avoids implying an active condition or any additional attributes."
258987008,Femtomole/second (qualifier value),unit of measure: femtomole per second,"This entry specifies the unit of measure as femtomole per second, a qualifier value representing amount-of-substance per second. It is an exact match to SCTID 258987008. More general unit categories or siblings with different prefixes or time bases are not indicated. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not add any attributes beyond identifying the unit."
1193794003,Holy See (geographic location),Residence listed as Holy See,"The statement indicates the residence location is the Holy See, which matches SNOMED CT concept 1193794003. The primary concept is the named geographic place, and the category is Geographic location (Location). The context of residence does not change the location being coded, and there is no reference to a different place or to organizational entities. Thus, this precisely maps to Holy See and not to broader or sibling locations."
11901000175103,Autism screening declined (situation),ASD screening declined.,"ASD stands for autism spectrum disorder; 'ASD screening' is a clinically equivalent way to refer to autism screening. The entry states the screening was declined, placing it in the Situation category. Autism screening declined (situation) precisely captures this, while parent concepts like 'screening not done' fail to convey the reason, and sibling concepts for other screenings or evaluations would be inaccurate."
256370008,Leukocyte apheresis - CMV negative (product),Apheresis leukocyte component—CMV-negative,"The entry names the blood component product obtained via leukocyte apheresis and includes the CMV-negative attribute. It fits the Product category and maps to SCTID 256370008. The phrasing does not imply transfusion, ordering, irradiation, or other modifications. Parent concepts that omit CMV status are too broad, while sibling concepts focused on other cell types (e.g., granulocytes, platelets) or added processing steps are not indicated by the wording."
430133009,Specimen from lip (specimen),Accession note: specimen site—lip,"Accession note specifying the specimen site as lip. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps to 430133009 because it indicates a specimen with lip as the source. Concepts for generic specimens or other oral structures are less precise, and child concepts adding technique or subsite are not supported by the entry."
121569005,Ethyl acetate measurement (procedure),Ethyl acetate lab measurement,"This entry frames the measurement within a laboratory context but does not introduce a specific specimen, method, or interpretive attribute. The main concept remains a measurement procedure, matching SNOMED CT 121569005. A parent concept such as generic laboratory measurement is overly broad, and children with specified matrices or methodologies would add details not present. 'Lab measurement' is a contextual synonym that preserves the procedure meaning."
32571000087109,Memnoniella echinata (organism),Memnoniella echinata documented,"The entry records the species Memnoniella echinata, directly naming the organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Documentation context aside, the content refers specifically to the species, so the correct code is Memnoniella echinata (32571000087109). Broader taxonomic parents or other species would misrepresent the statement. No attributes such as disease, site, or timing are included."
73460001,Gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus (organism),Pleomorphic gram-negative bacillus organism,"This wording conveys the organism class—gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus—without adding any other qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It matches SCTID 73460001 and is more specific than generic gram-negative bacillus. There is no implication of species, site, or clinical condition."
411584002,Ferret epithelium diagnostic allergen extract (product),Reagent: ferret epithelium diagnostic allergen extract,"This lab reagent is explicitly a diagnostic allergen extract derived from ferret epithelium, mapping directly to 411584002. Category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). “Reagent” is a usage context for the diagnostics and does not change the product identity. It avoids parent generality and any sibling/child concepts tied to other species or different formulations."
846611009,Community dental clinic (environment),Visit location: community dental clinic,"This describes the visit location and names the environment as a community dental clinic, fitting the Environment class. SCTID 846611009 Community dental clinic (environment) is the most precise match. Parent concepts lacking 'community' are overly broad, and sibling environments like hospital or school dental clinics are different locations. The wording does not add other attributes (e.g., timing, severity), keeping the mapping uniquely to the environment."
1287128002,Surgical margin involved by primary malignant neoplasm of nasal cavity and/or nasal sinus in excised tissue specimen (observable entity),Final pathology shows margin involvement by primary nasal cavity/sinus malignancy,"The main concept is positive margin status (margin involvement) identified on final pathology for a primary malignant neoplasm of the nasal cavity and/or nasal sinus. This is an Observable entity. It maps to SCTID 1287128002 because it specifies the sinonasal site, primary status, and margin involvement in the excised specimen context. Parent concepts that do not specify the site are less appropriate, and child concepts adding subsites or margin orientation are not conveyed. The phrasing “margin involvement” directly equates to positive margin without altering the intended code."
464240004,Nasal suction system (physical object),Nose suction system.,"This wording uses “nose” as a lay synonym for “nasal,” but the concept remains a suction system specifically for the nasal area. No attributes such as power source, disposability, pediatric specificity, or usage timing are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 464240004 is appropriate because the term clearly aligns with a nasal suction system; “nose” and “nasal” are clinically interchangeable for location in this context. Parent concepts like general suction systems lack the nasal focus, and sibling devices for non-nasal regions are excluded by the wording."
119300005,Specimen from blood product (specimen),Specimen: blood product source,"This documentation-style phrase makes the source of the specimen explicit as a blood product, aligning with SNOMED CT 119300005. Main concept: specimen with source specified as blood product. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The entry does not add any other attributes such as volume or method. Parent codes are less specific, while child concepts tied to particular product types are too narrow. Sibling “Blood specimen” would misclassify the source as patient blood rather than product."
696231010000103,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Mycobacterium kansasii (substance),Documentation term used: Mycobacterium kansasii DNA,"The entry indicates a documentation term, but the substantive concept is 'Mycobacterium kansasii DNA,' which is a species-specific DNA Substance. It contains no attributes of detection, measurement, or method, ensuring it stays within the Substance category. Parent concepts lack specificity, and siblings—such as RNA of M. kansasii or DNA of other organisms—are not equivalent. The phrasing is a harmless contextual wrapper around the same clinically precise concept."
726778005,Entire bronchoesophageal artery (body structure),Named vessel: bronchoesophageal artery,"The entry calls out the bronchoesophageal artery as a named vessel, which is synonymous with the complete artery as an anatomical structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 726778005 (Entire bronchoesophageal artery) is the most precise code because the term identifies the whole named artery. It avoids new attributes (origin, laterality, branching) and therefore does not fit better to parent, sibling, or child concepts."
1290906002,Traumatic brain injury protection compression collar (physical object),Patient issued a traumatic brain injury protection compression collar,"In a distribution context, the object specified is a compression collar for TBI protection. Main concept: the physical object dispensed to the patient. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. Despite the procedural wording ('issued'), the device named is precisely SCTID 1290906002. Parent concepts (e.g., generic protective devices) or siblings (e.g., helmets, mouthguards) are inappropriate because the entry clearly identifies a compression collar intended for TBI protection. No additional device attributes are stated."
217979005,Accident caused by molding machine (event),External cause classification—accident due to molding machine,"This reflects a classification context, stating the external cause as an accident due to a molding machine, exactly matching the SNOMED CT Event 'Accident caused by molding machine' (217979005). It avoids adding injury type, body site, location, or temporal qualifiers. Parent concepts lacking the specific machine are less precise, and sibling concepts for other machines would not fit. 'Due to' is a direct causal synonym and maintains code fidelity."
258520000,Vaginal swab (specimen),Specimen description: vaginal swab,"This is a documentation-style statement identifying the specimen as a vaginal swab, aligning with Vaginal swab (specimen) SCTID 258520000. Category: Specimen. The code is exact because it captures the swab form and vaginal site. Parent concepts are broader, and child concepts like high vaginal swab add a qualifier not present. Sibling concepts (endocervical swab, vaginal smear, vaginal fluid) reflect different specimen types. The descriptive context does not add clinical attributes beyond the specimen identity."
698593009,History of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (situation),Patient reports prior non-STEMI,"This patient-stated history communicates a previous episode of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. The wording carries explicit past context and does not add extra attributes (no dates or complications mentioned). The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 698593009 best fits because it encodes a history of NSTEMI. A generic “History of MI” parent lacks the non-ST elevation detail, and coding an active NSTEMI disorder would misrepresent the temporal context as current."
251323008,Peer assessment rating (orthodontic index) (observable entity),Peer assessment rating (PAR) index noted,"This entry indicates the presence or documentation of the Peer Assessment Rating index without any result value or timing, keeping the focus on the observable index itself. The verb “noted” provides context but does not change the entity being referenced. It would be less appropriate to select a parent orthodontic index or a sibling index such as IOTN. It does not describe a procedure; therefore, the observable entity Peer assessment rating (orthodontic index) is the most precise match."
85358006,Construction of venous valves (procedure),Postoperative documentation: venous valve construction,"The document describes the procedure performed as venous valve construction, belonging to the Procedure category. The precise match is 85358006, since the entry explicitly names construction of venous valves. Parent concepts are overly broad, and sibling procedures (e.g., repair, insertion) imply different surgical goals. The entry provides no additional attributes beyond identifying the procedure, supporting the exact code selection."
442981000124102,Adult hydrolyzed protein formula (product),Adult hydrolyzed protein formula,"The phrase explicitly names a nutrition product composed of hydrolyzed protein and intended for adults, which matches the SNOMED CT product concept Adult hydrolyzed protein formula (442981000124102). The attributes stated are age category (adult) and composition (hydrolyzed protein) in the context of a formula product. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Nutritional product). A more general parent such as Hydrolyzed protein formula (product) lacks the adult specificity, and siblings like Infant hydrolyzed protein formula or adult polymeric formulas would misrepresent the composition or target age group. No additional attributes (dose, route, indication) are introduced, so this is the most precise match."
244772005,Entire lateral pterygoid muscle (body structure),Structure identified: lateral pterygoid muscle,"The statement identifies the anatomical structure as the lateral pterygoid muscle, implying the complete muscle without side or segment. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 244772005, Entire lateral pterygoid muscle, is the precise match. Broader parents like 'pterygoid muscles' are non-specific, siblings such as 'medial pterygoid muscle' represent a different anatomy, and child concepts that subdivide by laterality or head are not indicated. The phrase is purely anatomical and does not introduce additional attributes."
297841008,Zunian language (qualifier value),Language: Zuni,"Here, the language field is populated with the synonym “Zuni,” which is equivalent to “Zunian language.” It represents the Qualifier value for the language choice and adds no attributes of preference, fluency, or role. This is more precise than the parent language category and does not correspond to any sibling. The synonym does not change the code, mapping to SCTID 297841008."
736628009,Epigastric sounds (observable entity),Sounds in the epigastrium,"This entry describes sounds localized to the epigastrium using a clear regional qualifier, without any added attributes such as normality, intensity, or type. It denotes the observable entity of epigastric sounds, fitting the SNOMED CT category Observable entity. It is more precise than parent concepts like abdominal sounds and does not imply specific child concepts (e.g., vascular bruits or bowel gurgling), making Epigastric sounds (736628009) the exact match."
7686002,Endoscopic removal of foreign body from larynx (procedure),Endoscopic removal of foreign body from the voice box,"“Voice box” is a lay term for the larynx, and the entry describes endoscopic removal of a foreign body from that site, matching “Endoscopic removal of foreign body from larynx.” Category: Procedure. The lay synonym does not change the clinical concept or add attributes. Parent concepts lacking endoscopic specification are less precise, and sibling concepts involving other airway regions or non-endoscopic methods would not fit. The entry remains uniquely codable to SCTID 7686002."
1304072005,Structure of transplanted duodenum (body structure),Transplanted duodenum visualized,"The phrase indicates that the anatomical structure (transplanted duodenum) was seen, but the core concept remains the structure itself. This fits the Body structure concept “Structure of transplanted duodenum” (SCTID: 1304072005). The visualization context does not change the code to an imaging procedure or a finding; no morphological or functional attributes are introduced. Parent concepts without the transplant attribute are less precise."
117675003,Ethion measurement (procedure),Ethion assay (quantitative),"This entry describes a quantitative assay of ethion, which is functionally equivalent to measuring its amount or concentration. In SNOMED CT terms, this is a Procedure and maps to Ethion measurement (procedure), 117675003. The qualifier 'quantitative' is inherent to measurement and does not add disqualifying attributes like specimen or method. Parent concepts are overly general, and sibling concepts like qualitative detection or screening do not match the wording. The synonym 'assay' is commonly used for lab measurement without changing the concept."
82612009,Stumbling (event),Chief complaint: stumbled,"This entry positions the event in the chief complaint but still denotes a single stumble without extra attributes. The main concept remains a stumbling event; there is no mention of falls, trips, injuries, timing specifics, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 82612009 is exact, while broader Event codes or different events like Fall would not align with the wording. The complaint framing is contextual and preserves the intended concept."
18284006,Phospholipid measurement (procedure),Assay of phospholipids,"This indicates a procedural assay to measure phospholipids, fitting the SNOMED CT Procedure category and mapping to Phospholipid measurement (18284006). It does not define sample type, specific phospholipid subclasses, or measurement method, so children are unnecessary. Parent concepts such as lipid assay are too broad, and the absence of result information avoids mapping to findings."
1351664004,Exposure to infective urethritis-associated organism (event),Reported exposure to urethritis-associated pathogen,"The entry communicates that exposure occurred to a pathogen associated with urethritis, with 'reported' simply reflecting documentation context rather than a clinical attribute of the exposure. It remains an Event and maps to SCTID 1351664004. Selecting a parent such as general exposure to pathogen would ignore the urethritis association, and selecting a child for a specific organism would misrepresent the general nature of the statement."
1352950004,Union for International Cancer Control stage II:21 (qualifier value),Tumor board consensus: UICC stage II,"The context of tumor board consensus does not alter the staged group; the core concept is UICC stage II. This is a Qualifier value entry and maps precisely to the UICC stage II qualifier. Parent concepts without a specific level and child concepts like IIA/IIB/IIC would be inaccurate here due to lack of substaging detail. Sibling stages are excluded by the explicit II. The phrasing is a valid clinical documentation synonym, maintaining the same staging system and level without adding extraneous attributes."
387377009,Calcium chloride (substance),Ingredient name: calcium chloride,"The entry identifies calcium chloride purely by its ingredient name, which still denotes the substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 387377009 is appropriate because the phrase does not specify any particular product, strength, route, or hydrated form—only the chemical entity. Parents like 'Calcium salt' are less specific, and children/siblings reflecting alternative compounds or formulations would not match the wording. The ingredient context does not alter the substance concept."
1258872006,Family referred to diabetes structured education program (situation),Family unit referred to structured diabetes education program,The entry describes the family unit being referred to a structured diabetes education program. The primary concept is a referral involving the family and the program is explicitly structured and focused on diabetes. This is a Situation in SNOMED CT. It fits SCTID 1258872006 because it includes the family context and the structured diabetes education target. Parent concepts lacking the family dimension or siblings such as attendance/completion are not accurate here. ‘Family unit’ is a synonymous way to express ‘family’ and does not change the code selection.
262146004,Sine wave (qualifier value),Form of oscillation: sine wave,"This states the form of oscillation is a sine wave, functioning purely as a waveform descriptor. It is a Qualifier value. The code 262146004 for “sine wave” is most precise. A parent category would be too general, and sibling shapes (e.g., square or sawtooth) would be inaccurate. The paraphrase does not introduce new attributes and is equivalent to the preferred concept."
120877007,Antibody to Neisseria meningitidis group A (substance),Report item: antibody to N. meningitidis serogroup A,"Framed as a report item, the core concept remains the antibody directed to N. meningitidis serogroup A. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps to 120877007 on the basis of specified serogroup A. Parent or sibling concepts would either generalize or misidentify the targeted serogroup, and child concepts with isotype or detection status would add attributes not present here. The phrasing is a contextual synonym, not altering the concept."
434014007,Specimen from mediastinum obtained by biopsy (specimen),Biopsy specimen of mediastinum,"This phrasing clearly presents a specimen, specifying that it is a biopsy and the site is the mediastinum. It fits the Specimen category with site and method attributes and maps to SCTID 434014007. It is not a procedural statement and avoids narrowing to particular mediastinal components, preserving the correct granularity."
269734009,Assault by manual strangulation (event),Assault: throttled by hands,"The documentation states an assault and identifies the method as throttling by hands, which is equivalent to manual strangulation. This is an Event and matches SCTID 269734009 precisely. A parent such as “Assault (event)” lacks the mechanism detail, and a sibling like “Assault by ligature strangulation (event)” is incorrect because the hands/manual method is specified. The wording does not add extraneous attributes like severity or timeframe."
223906001,Warwickshire (geographic location),Follow-up location field: Warwickshire,"This entry presents 'Warwickshire' in a follow-up form field context, but the value itself remains solely the geographic entity without conveying residency or event attributes. The main concept is the county Warwickshire. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223906001 is the appropriate code. Mapping to parent areas (England/UK) would be too general, and mapping to specific districts would be too narrow. The contextual label does not change the identity of the location being coded."
262400006,Hamptoni (qualifier value),Code text: Hamptoni,"This states that the code text is Hamptoni, which directly corresponds to the qualifier value concept SCTID 262400006. No clinical attributes or specific entities are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. Parent classes are overly general, and other value names (siblings) are not indicated; thus the exact Hamptoni qualifier is the correct selection."
1363264001,Scheie gonioscopy grading system degree of angle pigmentation - none (qualifier value),Scheie gonioscopy—angle pigmentation none.,"The entry highlights gonioscopy assessed via the Scheie system and states 'angle pigmentation none.' This is a grading value assignment, fitting the Qualifier value category. SCTID 1363264001 matches the 'none' value for Scheie angle pigmentation degree. Parent concepts without a specific value or sibling values denoting pigment would be less accurate. The concise format preserves equivalence without adding attributes like laterality or severity."
411954000,Iva ciliata specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Test materials: Iva ciliata allergen extract for diagnosis,"The entry describes test materials and specifies the allergen extract for diagnosis from Iva ciliata. The main concept is a diagnostic product, mapping to SNOMED CT 411954000. The phrasing is a synonymic paraphrase of the preferred term and keeps source specificity and diagnostic intent. It does not drift to parent generic diagnostic extracts or to siblings for other species or therapeutic use. No additional attributes such as route, dose, or test method are introduced."
252034002,Erection frequency (observable entity),Erection frequency (observable entity),"This entry restates the concept name including its SNOMED category, making clear it is an Observable entity capturing the frequency characteristic of erections. There are no additional attributes such as abnormal values, timing, or etiologic factors. More general parent categories lack the specificity to erections, while sibling measures (e.g., erection duration) are not implied. Therefore, the exact concept code for erection frequency is warranted."
1162459006,Identification band (physical object),Admission identification band,"The phrase indicates an identification band associated with admission processes, yet it remains the same physical object whose function is identity. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Identification band (physical object) SCTID 1162459006 is the best match because no specialized technology or demographic subtype is introduced. A parent concept like ‘band’ or ‘bracelet’ would omit the identification attribute, and siblings such as ‘admission form’ or ‘badge’ are different objects."
244991001,Entire extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle (body structure),The extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle (ECRB),"The concept is the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle, with the abbreviation ECRB provided, both pointing to the same muscle in its entirety. Category is Body structure. This matches SCTID 244991001. Parent anatomical groupings are less precise, and sibling muscles (e.g., extensor carpi radialis longus) or related tendons would not match because the entry clearly refers to the specific muscle."
387327006,Ephedrine hydrochloride (substance),Ephedrine HCl noted by clinician,"This statement records the substance name as noted, using the standard abbreviation HCl for hydrochloride without additional attributes such as dose, route, or product form. It matches the SNOMED CT Substance category concept Ephedrine hydrochloride (387327006). Parent or sibling alternatives (ephedrine alone, other salts, or products) would not align because the salt is specified and no form is indicated."
67788009,Organ of Corti structure (body structure),Organ of Corti (body structure),"This phrase restates the preferred term with its semantic tag, making clear that the entry denotes an anatomical entity. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and the best match is Organ of Corti structure (67788009). Broader parent classes like inner ear structure would be too general, and more specific children like laterality-specific organ of Corti would add detail not present in the text. The parenthetical tag does not change the meaning; it confirms the same concept."
223662004,Croatia (geographic location),Croatia [geographic entity],"Bracketing the category as ‘geographic entity’ alongside Croatia maintains the concept as the sovereign country, mapping to Croatia (geographic location), SCTID 223662004. The SNOMED CT category is Location—Geographic location. This avoids broader parents (e.g., Europe) and does not indicate child subdivisions. Sibling geographic entities (other nations) are different. The label is a safe synonym that does not add attributes, ensuring the precise code is selected."
169702001,Entire thyrohyoid branch of ansa cervicalis (body structure),Exposure reveals the thyrohyoid branch of the ansa cervicalis,The entry describes exposure but the concept referenced is the anatomical Body structure: the thyrohyoid branch of the ansa cervicalis. It maps precisely to SCTID 169702001 and introduces no additional attributes. A generic ansa cervicalis or another branch would be less specific. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase naming the full branch.
121541002,Dicloxacillin measurement (procedure),Dicloxacillin concentration determination,"“Determination” denotes a measurement to establish the concentration of dicloxacillin, with no added attributes such as specimen type, method, timing, or interpretation. The category is Procedure. This maps precisely to 121541002 Dicloxacillin measurement (procedure), which covers determining the amount of dicloxacillin. Parent concepts that refer to generic drug determinations are too broad, and children that specify serum or peak/trough are not supported by the text. The synonym 'determination' is standard and does not change the concept."
464025007,"Oral care swab, non-sterile (physical object)",Packaging indicates non-sterile oral care swab,"This describes the labeled identity of the item: a non-sterile oral care swab, which is a device/physical object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The packaging context simply affirms the object and its non-sterile status, making SCTID 464025007 the most precise match. Parent concepts without sterility are less specific, and sterile or sampling swabs are excluded by the non-sterile and care-related wording."
408700007,Vascular stent observable (observable entity),Vascular stent observation concept (observable entity),"The entry identifies a concept used for observation related to a vascular stent and explicitly classifies it as an observable entity, without specifying any measured attribute. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 408700007 is the precise match as it denotes the general stent observable. Parent observables lack the stent context; child/sibling observables introduce attribute details (status, location, measurement) not present here. The wording is a direct synonym and retains neutrality."
258564008,Buccal smear specimen (specimen),Collected specimen: buccal smear,This laboratory intake format identifies a collected specimen and defines it as a buccal smear. The main concept is a specimen type: smear from buccal mucosa. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The precision matches Buccal smear specimen (258564008) and distinguishes it from parent categories that lack site or method specificity and from sibling concepts like buccal swab specimen. The context of ‘collected’ does not alter the specimen’s identity.
709079002,Allergen extract (product),Allergen extract noted in chart,"This is a documentation context confirming the presence of the product allergen extract. It should be coded as a Product, specifically SCTID 709079002 Allergen extract (product). The wording does not introduce attributes such as specific allergen species, formulation, diagnostic reagent use, or immunotherapy indication, so narrower child concepts are not appropriate. More general product categories would not be as precise as the allergen extract code."
457811000,Escherichia coli serotype O168:H14 (organism),Escherichia coli serotype O168:H14,"The entry explicitly names the organism Escherichia coli with the combined O (168) and H (14) antigens, which defines the specific serotype O168:H14. This is an Organism category concept in SNOMED CT. SCTID 457811000 is the precise match because it represents that exact serotyped bacterium. More general parents like “Escherichia coli (organism)” omit the serotype detail, and siblings such as other O:H combinations (e.g., O157:H7) would be incorrect. No additional attributes (e.g., disease, pathogenicity, site, timing) are implied; the wording is purely the organism designation."
15650671000119107,Paraffin embedded slide (specimen),Paraffin-embedded slide,"The entry names a slide that has been embedded in paraffin, which directly matches the SNOMED CT concept Paraffin embedded slide (specimen). The explicitly stated attributes are the specimen form (slide) and the embedding medium (paraffin). This fits the SNOMED CT category Specimen. It is more precise than parent concepts like generic Slide (specimen) or Paraffin embedded specimen, and avoids sibling or child concepts such as Histology slide (specimen) without embedding specified or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded variants that add fixation details not present here. The hyphenated phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not alter code selection."
427804001,Product containing chemokine receptor antagonist (product),Product containing chemokine receptor antagonist,"This wording explicitly states a product that contains a chemokine receptor antagonist, which aligns exactly with the SNOMED CT product class 'Product containing chemokine receptor antagonist.' No additional attributes such as dose, formulation, brand, or receptor subtype are introduced, preventing misclassification to child clinical drugs or subtype-specific antagonist products. A parent like 'Medicinal product' would be too broad, and siblings like 'Product containing chemokine receptor agonist' would be semantically opposite. The focus on 'product' avoids mapping to the corresponding substance hierarchy."
223942009,Western Isles (geographic location),Na h-Eileanan Siar,"Na h-Eileanan Siar is the Gaelic name for the Western Isles and is a direct synonym for the same geographic location. Category: Location (Geographic location). The precise match is Western Isles (geographic location) SCTID 223942009, as the text identifies only the place, not an organization or administrative function. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., Scotland, Inner Hebrides) would not fit the term used. The synonym does not introduce any added attributes."
309293007,Placenta biopsy specimen (specimen),Placental biopsy specimen submitted to pathology,"The phrase indicates submission to pathology and names the specimen as a biopsy specimen from the placenta. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This matches 309293007. More general parents would omit either source or method; more specific children would require added details (e.g., punch vs needle biopsy or substructures), which are not present here."
423671006,Specimen from peritoneal tumor implant (specimen),Submitted specimen — peritoneal tumor implant,"The text indicates a submitted specimen and specifies that it is from a peritoneal tumor implant, matching the concept SCTID 423671006. The main concept is a specimen; the attribute is the origin (peritoneal tumor implant). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It is not a procedural statement (no biopsy/excision stated) and does not add malignancy, laterality, or other modifiers, so parent concepts are too broad and child/sibling concepts with method or diagnosis would be less appropriate."
47625008,Intravenous route (qualifier value),Patient states it was given through an IV.,"A patient-reported statement that administration was 'through an IV' conveys the intravenous route without specifying infusion vs injection, line type, timing, or substance. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value; 47625008 Intravenous route best represents the concept. Mapping to a generic parent would lose specificity, and choosing child concepts like IV bolus or peripheral IV would add details not present. 'Through an IV' is functionally synonymous with 'intravenous route.'"
223788007,Part of European country (geographic location),Portion of European country,"‘Portion’ is a generic synonym for ‘part’, indicating a subnational piece of a European country. Main concept: geographic location as a part of a country in Europe. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. This matches SCTID 223788007 because it captures both the containment (within a country) and continental (Europe) constraints without further specification. Parent concepts like ‘Part of country’ lack the European qualifier; child concepts (e.g., ‘City of European country’) introduce specificity not present here; and sibling concepts for other regions are not applicable."
350467002,Product containing calcium regulating hormone (product),Calcium-regulation hormone medication product,"This is a medication product whose active ingredient is a hormone that regulates calcium, a direct paraphrase of the target concept. The SNOMED CT category is Product, mapping to SCTID 350467002. The phrase does not include route, dose, brand, or particular hormone names, avoiding more specific children. It is narrower than parent hormone products because it specifies the calcium-regulatory function, aligning exactly with the concept’s intent. The slight wording variation remains clinically equivalent and does not affect the code selection."
217896007,Accidental bumping into stationary object (event),Chart entry: accidental bumping into a stationary object,"A chart entry restating the event retains the key elements—accidental occurrence and stationary object involvement. Category: Event. This is uniquely codable to 217896007, and does not drift to parent or sibling concepts. No extraneous attributes (such as injury details or location) are present, preserving exact alignment with the concept."
242715004,Accidentally caught under heavy object due to losing grip (event),Accidentally caught under heavy object due to losing grip.,"The entry explicitly states an unintended event where the person was caught under a heavy object and identifies the cause as losing grip. This matches the SNOMED CT Event category concept “Accidentally caught under heavy object due to losing grip” (SCTID 242715004). Parent concepts like generic “Accidental event” are too broad, and sibling or child concepts such as “Struck by falling object” or “Caught between objects” are not appropriate because the wording specifies being under the heavy object and the mechanism is grip loss leading to entrapment, not a strike or compression between items. The phrase uses standard synonyms (accidentally, caught under) without adding attributes beyond the defined cause, ensuring precise mapping to this event."
71391002,Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (substance),Ethanolamine deaminase (enzyme),"This entry uses the accepted synonym ‘ethanolamine deaminase’ with an enzyme descriptor, still referring to ethanolamine ammonia-lyase. As a specific biochemical molecule, it belongs in SNOMED CT’s Substance hierarchy with SCTID 71391002. More general parents or alternate deaminases would not be as precise because the substrate specificity (ethanolamine) is implied by the name. The parenthetical does not add clinical attributes and only clarifies the molecular class, leaving the substance coding unchanged."
281421004,Brainstem death tests (procedure),Brainstem death test battery,"“Test battery” clearly denotes a procedural set of tests specifically aimed at brainstem death assessment, not an isolated component test or a declaration. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 281421004 matches because it represents the grouped tests used in brainstem death evaluation. A parent concept such as neurologic exam lacks specificity to brainstem death, and a sibling like brain death determination implies a diagnostic conclusion rather than the testing process. The term is a safe synonym that maintains the same scope."
447391001,Specimen from pharynx obtained by aspiration (specimen),Specimen obtained by aspiration from pharynx,"This full phrase states the collection method (aspiration) and the source (pharynx) for a specimen, matching a Specimen concept. SNOMED CT 447391001 is the exact code since it requires both attributes. Choosing a parent like “Specimen from pharynx” would omit the method, and a sibling like “Nasopharyngeal aspirate” would misstate the site. The wording is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term, ensuring equivalence."
225138008,Drying skin creases (procedure),Intertriginous crease drying,"Intertriginous creases are skin folds where opposing surfaces meet, equivalent to skin creases in this context. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The entry describes drying those creases, which corresponds precisely to SCTID 225138008. Broader parent concepts omit the crease emphasis, and siblings for cleaning are different interventions. No site-specific detail or other attributes are introduced."
280787009,Entire lamina of fifth thoracic vertebra (body structure),Lamina—fifth thoracic vertebra,"This entry concisely states the lamina of the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5), an anatomical Body structure. SNOMED CT concept 280787009 (Entire lamina of fifth thoracic vertebra) is the most accurate mapping, as the entry implies the whole lamina at that level without laterality or other attributes. Parents like “lamina of thoracic vertebra” lack level specificity, and children adding left or right are not indicated. No sibling anatomical structures are referenced."
160306009,Family history: Nutritional deficiency (situation),Family history of nutrient deficiency,"Using the clinically equivalent synonym “nutrient deficiency” for “nutritional deficiency,” this entry documents a family history context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and SCTID 160306009 is the correct code. The synonym does not alter meaning or add attributes; it remains general to deficiency of nutrients without specifying a type, so narrower concepts are avoided and broader ones are less precise."
103558009,Alexandrium (organism),Alexandrium dinoflagellate,"Main concept: Alexandrium, described by its general taxonomic group as a dinoflagellate. No attributes of toxicity, bloom, detection, or site are added. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The modifier 'dinoflagellate' is a correct classification and does not change the code selection from Alexandrium (organism) SCTID: 103558009. Coding to 'Dinoflagellate (organism)' as a parent would be overly broad, and species children would be too narrow."
269657006,Accident due to being thrown against fixture in off-road land motor vehicle (event),Off-road land motor vehicle accident—thrown against vehicle fixture.,"This documentation phrase describes an accident involving an off-road land motor vehicle with the mechanism of the person being thrown against a vehicle fixture. The main concept is the external cause event, categorized in SNOMED CT as an Event. The wording maps directly to 269657006 because it retains all defining elements: off-road land motor vehicle and thrown against fixture. It avoids parent/general external cause phrasing and avoids child-level specifics such as ATV or roll cage, making the given concept the most specific match."
283983000,Linguatula denticulata (organism),Consultation notes identify the species Linguatula denticulata,"The narrative names the species Linguatula denticulata within consult notes but does not claim detection or disease, keeping the focus on the organism entity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 283983000 fits because it captures the exact species concept. Using a genus or parasitic-organism class would be too general, and any disorder/detection concept is not indicated."
1248691000168108,Women's health service (qualifier value),Women's health service documented by provider,"Provider documentation context does not change the core concept, which is a women's health service type. Category: Qualifier value. No clinical attributes are added that would shift mapping to a procedure, department, or specialty. The qualifier value is the most accurate, whereas child/sibling services (e.g., obstetric service) introduce specificity not present. Maps to 1248691000168108."
245313002,Superficial inguinal lymph node group (body structure),Superficial inguinal lymph nodes,"This wording is a clinically equivalent synonym that refers to the superficial inguinal lymph node group without adding attributes. The concept is anatomical and falls under Body structure, matching SNOMED CT 245313002. It avoids parent concepts that include both superficial and deep nodes and does not imply child subsets (e.g., horizontal or vertical groups), making the code an exact fit."
768596007,Product containing yttrium and/or yttrium compound (product),Yttrium-ingredient product documented,"The entry denotes documentation of a product whose ingredient is yttrium, mapping to SCTID 768596007. Main concept: product containing yttrium; no specification of isotope (e.g., Y-90), salt, route, or therapeutic class. SNOMED CT category: Product. Choosing a parent would be overly general, and any child/sibling focusing on a specific yttrium derivative would be too narrow. The synonym “yttrium-ingredient product” is semantically equivalent to “product containing yttrium” and does not alter code selection."
67966000,"Enema tube, device (physical object)",Medical device: enema tube,The main concept is the enema tube identified explicitly as a medical device. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). This matches SCTID 67966000 since it refers to the specific tube component utilized in enema setups. It is not a procedure or a finding about device presence; it is the object itself. Alternatives such as 'enema bag' or 'rectal tube' are siblings and would not fit the wording that clearly identifies the tube.
258565009,Chorionic villi specimen (specimen),Chorionic villi specimen,"The entry explicitly names a specimen composed of chorionic villi, which are the villous structures of the chorion. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the most precise concept is Chorionic villi specimen (258565009). This matches the material source exactly without adding method, timing, or processing details. Broader or sibling concepts such as placental tissue specimen or amniotic fluid specimen would be incorrect or less specific because they do not restrict the source to chorionic villi. The phrasing is the preferred term and contains no attributes that would shift the code selection."
59906009,Glucose dehydrogenase (pyrroloquinolinequinone) (substance),PQQ-linked glucose dehydrogenase,"“PQQ-linked” indicates the enzyme’s reliance on pyrroloquinoline quinone, identifying the quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This synonym is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and maps precisely to SCTID 59906009, not to NAD-linked or FAD-linked enzymes. It avoids broader or sibling enzyme concepts."
428336002,Aquabacterium commune (organism),Species: Aquabacterium commune,"This label format communicates that the named species is Aquabacterium commune, which is a taxonomic organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism; the appropriate code is Aquabacterium commune (SCTID 428336002). There are no clinical attributes added (e.g., infection, site, culture status), only the species name itself. Using a parent like Aquabacterium (genus) would reduce specificity, and using a child like a strain would add detail not present. Other Aquabacterium species as siblings are excluded by the exact species designation."
1187493007,Territory of Norfolk Island (geographic location),Patient reports living on the Norfolk Island Territory,"This patient-reported statement specifies the geographic location as Norfolk Island Territory, a synonym for Territory of Norfolk Island, aligning with SCTID 1187493007. The category is Geographic location (Location). The living context frames usage but does not alter the place-based concept. Using only “Norfolk Island” could map to an island-geography sibling, so the territorial wording is needed for precision. No extra attributes beyond context are introduced."
411221007,Metallic compound patch test product (product),Metallic compound patch test allergen product,"Patch test products are commonly referred to as allergen products in dermatology; here it is specified to be composed of metallic compounds. Main concept: patch test product, metallic compound subtype. SNOMED CT category: Product. Code 411221007 is appropriate because the entry describes a product (not a substance alone) and confines it to metallic compounds. A parent concept lacks the metallic qualifier, and a child naming a specific allergen (e.g., nickel) is not supported. The term 'allergen product' remains within the product hierarchy and does not shift to a substance code."
161482000,History of trigeminal neuralgia (situation),Chart lists trigeminal neuralgia in history,"The phrase explicitly indicates that the medical record includes trigeminal neuralgia in the patient’s history, not as an active problem. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. The exact match is “History of trigeminal neuralgia (situation)” because it references past occurrence. Coding to the disorder would misrepresent current status, and a parent history concept would be less specific. The wording is a documentation-style synonym for history-of without added qualifiers."
262247004,Valbuzzi (qualifier value),Category: Valbuzzi,"Stating 'Category: Valbuzzi' indicates a selected category value, which maps to the named qualifier in SNOMED CT SCTID 262247004. It does not add any clinical content, intensity, laterality, or temporal attribute—just the value. The category is Qualifier value. Broader parent categories would be nonspecific, and any sibling qualifier would be a different term, so 262247004 is the most precise match."
242368007,Accidental ingestion of terpineol (event),Documentation: accidental terpineol ingestion event,The entry labels the occurrence as an accidental ingestion event involving terpineol. SNOMED CT category: Event. This is exactly Accidental ingestion of terpineol (event) 242368007. The documentation context does not alter the concept; other codes lacking ingestion or accidental intent would be inferior matches.
394872000,Ready to stop smoking (finding),Patient ready to quit smoking,"This problem-list style phrasing indicates a Clinical finding that the patient is ready for smoking cessation. SNOMED CT 394872000 is the most accurate code because it captures readiness to stop smoking, not mere willingness or contemplation. No additional attributes are introduced (no plan, date, or method). The synonym 'quit' is equivalent to 'stop' in this context."
443161000124103,Soy-based infant weaning formula (product),Order entry: soy-based infant weaning formula,"Main concept: an order references the product soy-based infant weaning formula. Attributes are soy-based composition and infant weaning formula type; the order context does not change coding. SNOMED CT category: Product. This aligns with Soy-based infant weaning formula (product), SCTID 443161000124103. Broader parent concepts omit the soy qualifier, and sibling concepts for cow’s milk-based weaning formula or generic soy infant formula (non-weaning) would be less accurate. No extra attributes are specified."
361619007,Structure of eighth posterior intercostal artery (body structure),CTA report: eighth posterior intercostal artery noted,"This imaging report context mentions the eighth posterior intercostal artery, specifying the exact vessel and level without laterality or any condition. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The correct code is 361619007 for the structure of the eighth posterior intercostal artery. A parent concept would be insufficiently specific, and sibling levels would be incorrect. The term 'noted' simply indicates observation and does not introduce attributes that would change the concept."
34707002,Structure of biliary tree (body structure),Discussed the biliary tree with the patient,"The note indicates patient education about the anatomical biliary tree, which maps to SNOMED CT 34707002 (Body structure). There is no implication of pathology or inclusion of non-ductal structures such as the gallbladder. As such, it is more precise than a broader hepatobiliary system term and avoids narrower child duct concepts. The synonym remains within the scope of the biliary duct network."
62257000,Genus Setosphaeria (organism),Setosphaeria (genus),"The entry names the organism taxon at genus rank: Setosphaeria. The main concept is the fungal genus Setosphaeria without any species, site, or clinical context. In SNOMED CT this belongs to the Organism hierarchy, and the most precise concept is Genus Setosphaeria (organism), SCTID 62257000. Broader parent categories like Fungus (organism) are too general, while child concepts specifying individual Setosphaeria species would add detail not present here. Sibling genera (e.g., other dematiaceous fungi) are incorrect because the genus is explicitly Setosphaeria."
466166008,Silicone dental impression material (physical object),Used silicone dental impression material for the impression,"The sentence reports use of silicone dental impression material, but the core concept remains the physical object itself. Category: Physical object. This fits SCTID 466166008 because it specifies silicone as the impression material. The context of use does not introduce subtype attributes; therefore, child concepts like addition-cured silicone are not implicated. Parent concepts are too broad, and other material types are not mentioned."
1260276004,Chief nutrition complaint (observable entity),Primary dietary complaint,"Here 'primary' is used as a synonym for 'chief' and 'dietary' for 'nutrition,' preserving the meaning of the foremost complaint in the nutrition/dietetics domain. The concept is an Observable entity and aligns with SNOMED CT 1260276004. The entry avoids any specific content and does not add attributes like timing or severity; therefore, parent or sibling concepts would be less precise than the specified nutrition-focused chief complaint."
698751005,Absence of wound odor (situation),Nursing note: wound odor none.,"This entry, styled as a documentation note, explicitly indicates that wound odor is none, i.e., absent. The most precise mapping is to SNOMED CT 698751005 Absence of wound odor (situation). General odor absence or findings not tied to wound context would be less specific, and siblings for presence or foul odor would conflict with 'none.' The phrasing is equivalent to 'absence' and does not introduce new attributes."
224868005,Technical college (environment),At technical college,"The prepositional phrase indicates location within a 'technical college' environment, without introducing other attributes (cause, severity, timing, etc.). This is a direct fit to SNOMED CT concept 224868005 in the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. General parents (e.g., educational institution) and related siblings (e.g., university, vocational school) are not referenced, so the technical college concept is the most precise code."
28064001,Fratricide (event),Brother killed by his brother,"This wording makes clear that the victim is a brother and the perpetrator is his brother, which matches fratricide exactly. It adds no detail beyond the familial relationship and the killing event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. More general parent concepts (e.g., homicide) lack the brother-specific relationship, and related sibling concepts like sororicide would be excluded by the explicit male sibling term."
298528001,No passive range of thoracic spine extension (finding),Thoracic spine extension – no passive range of motion.,"This note identifies the movement (extension), the location (thoracic spine), the testing mode (passive), and the finding (no range of motion). It is a Clinical finding of absent passive ROM. Code 298528001 is the precise SNOMED concept because it targets “No passive range of thoracic spine extension.” Using a parent concept like “Absent passive ROM” without the body site or motion would be less specific, and a sibling like “No active thoracic extension” or “Restricted passive extension” would not match the total absence of passive extension. The phrasing is a direct equivalent without added attributes."
1208370004,Heard Island and McDonald Islands (geographic location),Heard Island/McDonald Islands,"The slash construction in “Heard Island/McDonald Islands” functions as an editorial variant that still refers to the single territorial entity comprising both island groups. The main concept is a geographic location only. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location; qualifier value). This exactly matches the intended SNOMED concept; choosing a parent like “Geographic location” lacks specificity, and selecting a child such as “Heard Island” alone would be incorrect. The synonym form does not introduce new attributes or alter the coding intent."
773607000,Sting by nettle (event),Complaint noted: nettle sting,"The complaint is a nettle sting, expressed as an event rather than a diagnosis. There are no additional attributes included. This precisely maps to SNOMED CT Event Sting by nettle (773607000). Parent event concepts like plant sting would be too general, and sibling disorder concepts are not appropriate because the entry does not assert any clinical sequela."
411629002,Asparagus officinalis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Asparagus officinalis diagnostic allergen preparation (extract),"“Preparation (extract)” clarifies the product form while keeping the diagnostic allergen extract meaning intact, with Asparagus officinalis specified, matching 411629002. Main concept: diagnostic allergen extract product; attributes: species and diagnostic purpose. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). This is more specific than generic diagnostic allergen preparations and does not suggest a therapeutic formulation or a different allergen source."
235512008,Direct measurement of pancreatic parenchymal pressure (procedure),Direct measurement: pressure inside the pancreatic parenchyma,"By stating 'direct measurement' and 'inside the pancreatic parenchyma', the entry clearly identifies the procedural act and location. Concepts: direct measurement, pancreatic parenchyma; category: Procedure. This best matches SCTID 235512008 and is not a fit for parent or sibling concepts involving other sites (e.g., duct) or non-direct techniques."
106845006,Family Acaridae (organism),Mite taxonomy: Acaridae,"The entry presents the mite taxonomy at the family level, Acaridae, with no other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the appropriate code is Family Acaridae (organism) SCTID 106845006. Parent taxa such as Acari would be overly broad, and sibling families or child species are not indicated, making the family-level organism concept the most accurate mapping."
6751000146101,Rhodococcus kunmingensis (organism),"Genus Rhodococcus, species kunmingensis","This taxonomic presentation explicitly states the genus (Rhodococcus) and the species (kunmingensis). The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It is a clear synonymic representation of the species-level organism and does not add clinical attributes. It is more specific than the genus parent and does not imply any strain or subspecies, so the Rhodococcus kunmingensis organism concept is the most precise match."
416052003,Inferior transverse axis (body structure),Documented inferior transverse axis,"The phrase documents the presence of the inferior transverse axis, referencing the anatomical axis as a body structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches the specific concept Inferior transverse axis (416052003). Choosing a parent axis (transverse axis) would be less exact, and siblings denoting other directions do not align with the explicit inferior qualifier."
1142298007,Horizontal eyebrow (finding),"Patient reports, ""My eyebrow sits straight across.""","The patient phrase 'straight across' is a common-language synonym for horizontal orientation of the eyebrow, which is clinically equivalent to Horizontal eyebrow (1142298007) as a Clinical finding. No cause, severity, or laterality is implied. More general or alternative shape findings would be less accurate, and siblings (arched, angled) do not match 'straight across.'"
411669001,Conalbumin diagnostic allergen extract (product),Conalbumin diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry states the product name and purpose: an allergen extract of conalbumin intended for diagnostic use. The main concept is a pharmaceutical/biologic product, specifically a diagnostic allergen extract with conalbumin as the allergenic component. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Product category and matches SCTID 411669001 exactly. It does not introduce administration route, concentration, brand, or therapeutic use, so broader parent concepts like generic allergen extracts or sibling concepts for different allergens (e.g., ovalbumin) are less precise. The wording aligns directly with the preferred term, confirming this code as the most specific match."
364398005,Pattern of fluid intake (observable entity),Fluid consumption pattern (fluids),"“Fluid consumption pattern” is a clinically equivalent synonym for pattern of fluid intake; the parenthetical clarifies that the consumption refers to fluids, not solid foods. No amount, timing, or abnormality is stated. Thus, the Observable entity SNOMED CT 364398005 is the appropriate code. A broader concept of consumption pattern without fluid specificity would be less precise, and any concept involving quantity or adequacy would add attributes not present."
242801009,Exposure to radiation from nuclear reactor because of meltdown (event),Exposure to radiation from nuclear reactor meltdown recorded,"This entry records an exposure to radiation, explicitly stating the source and cause as a nuclear reactor meltdown. The main concept is a radiation exposure event tied to meltdown without added clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Event SCTID 242801009. Parent-level radiation exposure lacks the meltdown detail, and siblings representing other radiation sources or accidents are less appropriate. The documentation style does not change the conceptual equivalence to the preferred term."
223671008,Monaco (geographic location),Address country field: Monaco,"This refers to a data field value and clearly states the country as Monaco. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The most specific match is Monaco (geographic location) SCTID 223671008. A general parent such as “Country” lacks precision, and child/sibling areas within Monaco are not implicated. The field label is contextual and does not change the underlying concept, which is the Monaco location."
411640005,Brassica oleracea variant botrytis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Cauliflower diagnostic allergen extract material,"The core medical concept is a diagnostic allergen extract from cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis). Category: Product. The term 'material' is contextual but the essential product is the extract, matching SCTID 411640005. Broader diagnostic materials or general allergen substances would be less precise, and other Brassica variants would be incorrect. No added attributes like concentration or route are implied."
464271008,Vascular anastomosis clamp (physical object),Vascular anastomosis clamp included,"The entry denotes inclusion of a vascular anastomosis clamp, which is a physical object. This maps directly to Vascular anastomosis clamp (physical object), SCTID 464271008. The inclusion context is logistical and does not introduce clinical findings, usage outcomes, or subtype details that would alter code selection. It is more specific than parent concepts and avoids child or sibling devices by not specifying microvascular, bulldog, or brand names."
224084005,Number of previous marriages (observable entity),History item—number of previous marriages,"The phrase frames the observable as a history item, but the core concept is the count of previous marriages. It aligns with SNOMED CT 'Number of previous marriages' (224084005), under Observable entity. The label 'history item' is contextual and does not introduce attributes or values. It is more specific than general marital history and avoids siblings that include current marriages or other relationship counts. Without a number provided, it maintains the standard observable concept."
308787009,Embryonic ear structure (body structure),Embryonic ear,"The entry refers to the ear in the embryonic stage, focusing on anatomy rather than function or condition. The central concept is the embryonic ear as a Body structure, matching Embryonic ear structure (SCTID 308787009). Selecting a parent like Ear structure would lose the developmental qualifier, and selecting a child such as otic vesicle or auricular hillocks would add unnecessary specificity not present in the text. Sibling fetal or neonatal ear concepts are inappropriate because the term explicitly states embryonic. “Embryonic ear” is a clinically safe, concise synonym that does not alter the intended structure concept."
218153003,Burning caused by hydrofluoric acid (event),Provider documents: burning caused by hydrofluoric acid,"Clinician documentation indicates burning and identifies hydrofluoric acid as the cause, with no extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event, consistent with the causal phrasing. SCTID 218153003 is the most precise match, as it reflects the event of burning due to hydrofluoric acid. A parent concept like “Burning caused by acid” would be less specific, and sibling disorder concepts like “HF acid chemical burn” would imply injury. The wording mirrors the preferred term, ensuring exact mapping."
401232002,Unknown risk of deliberate self harm (finding),Care plan: self-harm risk recorded as unknown,"This care plan entry states that the self-harm risk status is recorded as unknown, aligning with ‘Unknown risk of deliberate self harm (finding)’ SCTID 401232002. The concept is a Clinical finding concerning risk with an unknown qualifier in the deliberate self-harm domain. The context ‘Care plan’ does not create new clinical attributes. It avoids specifying a level (excluding child codes) and remains more precise than the parent risk concept without invoking suicide-related sibling concepts."
714008000,Product containing hexosyltransferase inhibitor (product),Prior authorization requested for hexosyltransferase inhibitor drug,"This indicates an administrative action related to a drug whose class is hexosyltransferase inhibition, which corresponds to the SNOMED 'Product containing hexosyltransferase inhibitor'. The category is Product. No additional attributes such as dosage form, specific compound, or target subtype are included, avoiding child-level mapping. A broader enzyme inhibitor product or unrelated class would be imprecise. 'Drug' is a standard synonym for medicinal product and does not alter the concept."
1187208005,Cocos Keeling Islands (geographic location),Cocos (Keeling) Islands,"The entry exactly names the specific external territory in the Indian Ocean known as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which is a geographic place. The main concept is a geographic location, with no clinical attributes added. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). This is the most precise match for SCTID 1187208005 because it corresponds directly to the preferred term. Broader parent concepts like island group or geographic region would be too general, and child concepts such as individual islands within the group (e.g., West Island, Home Island) would be too specific. No sibling concepts (e.g., Christmas Island) fit the wording."
326374000,Low glucose concentration peritoneal dialysis solution (product),Low-dextrose peritoneal dialysate,"This entry denotes a peritoneal dialysate in which the glucose (dextrose) concentration is low. The SNOMED CT category is Product. “Dextrose” is clinically equivalent to glucose in the context of PD solutions, and “dialysate” is a common synonym for peritoneal dialysis solution, so the wording is semantically identical to the target concept. It does not imply a different composition (e.g., icodextrin or amino acids) and avoids a specific percentage, preventing mapping to a child concept. It is thus best coded to SCTID 326374000 rather than a generic parent or a sibling like medium/high glucose solutions."
336654008,Autodrop eye dropper (physical object),Autodrop eye dropper issued to patient,"This entry documents issuance of the Autodrop eye dropper, naming the specific device without adding clinical attributes or indications. It is a Physical object concept, best matched to Autodrop eye dropper (SCTID 336654008). Parent concepts such as generic eye dropper or ocular dispenser would be too broad, and sibling concepts involving other brands or types are not implied. The issuance context is administrative and does not change the device being identified."
309481000,Temporal artery specimen (specimen),Source: temporal artery (specimen),"The entry explicitly indicates the specimen’s source as the temporal artery and labels it as a specimen, with no further attributes. This maps to the Specimen category. SNOMED CT code 309481000 is the most accurate match because it captures a specimen from the temporal artery without specifying type or technique. Parent concepts (e.g., specimen from artery) are too generic, while children like tissue or biopsy specimens from the temporal artery would add details not provided. The parenthetical clarification maintains equivalence without changing the concept."
25751000087101,Inpatient mental health environment (environment),Behavioral health inpatient setting,"This entry uses 'setting' as a synonym for 'environment' and specifies the context as inpatient behavioral health. The main concept is environmental; there are no added attributes like acuity, unit type, or legal status. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The concept SCTID 25751000087101 is the best match because it represents an inpatient mental/behavioral health environment. Parent or sibling concepts—such as generic inpatient settings or outpatient behavioral health settings—do not capture the combined inpatient mental health context. 'Setting' is a recognized synonym for environment and preserves the same coding."
443361000124100,Pediatric formula (product),Paediatric feeding formula,"Main concept: feeding formula intended for pediatric patients; no route or special characteristics are described. SNOMED CT category: Product. UK spelling with 'feeding formula' is a clinically equivalent synonyms for pediatric formula, mapping to SCTID 443361000124100. It does not introduce enteral route, infant-only scope, or specialized properties, so narrower codes do not fit."
421181002,Infraorder Araneomorphae (organism),Reference organism: Araneomorphae,"The phrase denotes Araneomorphae as the referenced organism, which maps directly to SNOMED CT concept 421181002 (Organism). It does not introduce clinical effects, habitat, or narrower taxa, so it is not better coded to child families or broader Araneae. The wording remains focused on the infraorder-level organism."
256388000,Red cells - washed (product),Washed red blood cells,"The entry explicitly names the blood product as red blood cells with the attribute 'washed.' The main concept is a blood component product, specifically erythrocytes that have been washed to remove residual plasma and other substances. SNOMED CT category: Product (blood product). SCTID 256388000 'Red cells - washed (product)' is the most precise match because it identifies the exact product and process (washed) without introducing any additional qualifiers (e.g., leukoreduction, irradiation, ABO type). Broader parent concepts like 'Red cells (product)' lack the washing attribute, and sibling products such as 'Red cells - frozen' or 'Red cells - irradiated' are not indicated. The wording is a direct synonym for the preferred term and does not change code selection."
122689001,Specimen from right kidney obtained by radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy (specimen),Follow-up note: Reviewed results for the right kidney specimen from radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.,"This follow-up note references reviewing results of a right kidney specimen and states that it was obtained via radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. The concept represented is a specimen, belonging to the Specimen (Physical object) hierarchy. SCTID 122689001 is appropriate due to explicit laterality and both procedures. A parent concept or one without adrenalectomy would be incomplete, while concepts including adrenal tissue in the specimen would be too specific. The entry contains no added clinical attributes beyond method and site."
827111009,Defined border of mass of abdomen (finding),Discrete border noted around the abdominal mass,"The entry reports a discrete (clearly defined) border surrounding an abdominal mass, highlighting the border clarity. This is a Clinical finding and matches SNOMED CT 827111009. Coding instead to 'Abdominal mass' would omit the key attribute, and any sibling indicating indistinct margins would conflict. 'Discrete border' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'defined border' and introduces no additional features."
238249002,Umbilical cord clamp replacement (procedure),Umbilical cord clamp replacement,"The main concept expressed is the procedure of replacing an existing clamp on the umbilical cord. This is a Procedure category concept in SNOMED CT and precisely matches Umbilical cord clamp replacement (SCTID: 238249002). The wording explicitly denotes replacement, distinguishing it from initial clamping, removal, or adjustment, which would be sibling or parent concepts. No additional attributes (cause, timing, severity) are introduced, so this is the most accurate code."
242498004,Burning due to contact with hot soup (event),Mechanism described as burning from hot soup,"This entry captures the mechanism of injury event: burning caused by hot soup, which implies contact without specifying additional attributes. It is an Event-level external cause. SCTID 242498004 is exact because it specifies hot soup and burning through contact. A parent like “burning due to contact with hot liquid” is too general, and siblings referring to other hot substances are inappropriate. The synonym “burning from hot soup” is clinically equivalent to “due to contact with hot soup” for coding the event."
216965006,Temperature of locally applied material too hot (event),Temperature of locally applied material too hot,"The entry directly names the event of a locally applied material having a temperature that is too hot. The main concept is the excessive heat of material applied to the body, with no added attributes such as severity, site, timing, or consequences. SNOMED CT category: Event. This is the precise match to SCTID 216965006 because it exactly reflects the preferred term. Broader parents (e.g., unspecified abnormal temperature of locally applied material) would be less specific, and siblings like 'too cold' would be incorrect. There is no implication of a burn or patient hyperthermia, so disorder or clinical finding concepts are inappropriate."
223725007,Part of country (geographic location),Exposure occurred in a section of a country.,"The location is a 'section of a country,' meaning a geographic subset of national territory, which equates to 'part of country.' The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location; the exposure context does not change the place semantics. Concept 223725007 is the most precise match because no subdivision type is specified. Parent concepts are too broad, and child concepts such as province, county, or city are too specific for the wording. The synonym 'section' is neutral and does not introduce attributes."
1242008,Heterakis meleagridis (organism),Heterakis meleagridis (SCTID 1242008),"Including the code with the binomial Heterakis meleagridis anchors the reference to the SNOMED CT Organism concept SCTID 1242008. The entry does not assert detection, infection, or other clinical attributes, so it remains an organism identification. It is more specific than the Heterakis genus and avoids misidentifying another species, confirming the exact organism code."
167796003,"Spermatozoa morphology, no normal forms (finding)",Sperm cells: no normal forms on morphology review.,"The entry documents a morphology review revealing no normal forms among sperm cells, i.e., 0% normal. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 167796003 is the best match because it explicitly codes for absence of normal forms. Related but broader concepts like abnormal morphology do not ensure zero normal forms."
110441005,"Barr body absent, nuclear sex male (finding)",Nuclear sex male based on absent Barr body,"This statement ties nuclear sex male to the observed absence of Barr body, explicitly including both components. Category: Clinical finding. The combination uniquely identifies 110441005. Coding only 'nuclear sex male' or only 'Barr body absent' would be incomplete. The phrasing indicates equivalence without adding extra clinical attributes."
16213004,Glycine acetyltransferase (substance),Glycine acetyltransferase enzyme,"The entry states the enzyme name and explicitly calls it an enzyme, consistent with the SNOMED substance concept for glycine acetyltransferase. Category: Substance. No properties like activity level, genetic source, or administration are implied. Parent or sibling acetyltransferases lack glycine specificity, while N- or C- qualified enzymes add detail not present."
766921005,Product containing venom (product),Clinical supply item—product containing venom,"The phrase denotes a clinical supply and specifies that it is a product containing venom, aligning with SNOMED CT 766921005 (Product). No additional qualifiers such as species or formulation appear, so children are not selected. It remains a product concept rather than a substance concept, excluding siblings. The wording is an equivalent synonym that does not alter the mapping."
1296560007,Structure of spinal segment of lateral reticulospinal tract (body structure),Lateral reticulospinal tract spinal segmental component,"This entry labels the component of the lateral reticulospinal tract that lies at the spinal segment level, which is an anatomical body structure. It maps to SCTID 1296560007. Selecting the parent concept of the whole tract would include brainstem portions and be overly broad. Child concepts specifying particular spinal levels are not indicated here. The term “component” is a clinically equivalent synonym for ‘structure’ in this context and does not change the intended code."
223409003,Virgin Gorda (geographic location),Specimen origin: Virgin Gorda,"The text captures a location of origin for a specimen and names Virgin Gorda. The codable concept remains the geographic location Virgin Gorda in SNOMED CT, SCTID 223409003, under the Geographic location category. Mapping to a parent region or to a sub-locality would not match the explicit island named. The context of specimen handling does not change the location identity."
1204491001,Aland Islands (geographic location),The Åland Islands,"This is the same location named with its standard diacritic and a definite article, which remains a direct reference to the geographic place. Category: Geographic location (Location). The exact code is SCTID 1204491001. Parent concepts are too broad and do not specify Åland; siblings would denote other islands; children would denote cities or districts within Åland. The wording does not add any attribute beyond the place name."
364246006,Core body temperature measured vaginally (observable entity),Core body temperature measurement site: vagina,"This describes the observable core body temperature and states the measurement site as the vagina. Category: Observable entity. By specifying the site attribute, it matches SNOMED CT 364246006 'Core body temperature measured vaginally.' It is more specific than the parent 'core body temperature' without site and does not represent a different sibling route. It introduces no device, value, or clinical findings, supporting the correct observable code."
716571003,Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities Third Edition score (observable entity),Illinois ITPA Third Edition score,"This entry references the Illinois ITPA Third Edition and specifies the 'score', capturing the observable entity consistently. The primary concept is the ITPA-3 score; no additional features are introduced. It aligns with the Observable entity SCTID 716571003. A generic ITPA score would be insufficiently specific (parent), and a subtest or type of score would be overly specific (child/sibling). The wording is a synonym that retains the edition specificity, ensuring precise code selection."
450449008,Genus Wautersiella (organism),Laboratory record: Wautersiella genus,"This lab-context notation specifies the genus Wautersiella, still representing the organism concept. It should be coded to SNOMED CT 450449008 (Genus Wautersiella). No species or clinical condition is implied, so child species codes or sibling genera are not appropriate, and parent organism codes are not specific enough."
411671001,Corylus avellana diagnostic allergen extract (product),Corylus avellana diagnostic allergen preparation,"The wording specifies a diagnostic allergen preparation sourced from Corylus avellana, clearly indicating the diagnostic product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. 'Preparation' is a synonym for a formulated diagnostic extract and does not introduce details like dose, concentration, or form. It aligns precisely with 411671001, while parent concepts are overly broad and sibling concepts (e.g., therapeutic preparations or extracts tied to specific plant parts) are not suggested."
223627009,Solomon islands (geographic location),Solomon Islands (documented place),"The parenthetical descriptor indicates documentation context, while the place itself is “Solomon Islands,” aligning with SNOMED’s Location/Geographic location concept Solomon islands. No attributes like timing, regional qualifiers, or related events are present. Parent categories are generic; child concepts (e.g., Honiara, Guadalcanal) are not indicated; sibling nations are excluded by naming. Therefore, the most accurate and precise SNOMED code remains 223627009."
438984008,Streptomyces cinerochromogenes (organism),Organism: Streptomyces cinerochromogenes,"The entry labels the taxon explicitly as an organism and names the species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This matches SCTID 438984008 exactly, as it conveys only the species identity. The documentation context ""Organism:"" is neutral and does not add attributes like infection, specimen source, or resistance. Parent concepts (genus or higher taxonomic groups) are too broad, and any other Streptomyces species would be inaccurate."
468379001,Diagnostic condensing lens (physical object),Diagnostic exam condensing lens (no brand specified),"This entry describes a condensing lens used for diagnostic examination, explicitly noting the absence of brand detail, which keeps it generic. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 468379001 is the correct selection, as it represents the diagnostic condensing lens without tying to child concepts based on brand or power. Parent lens categories would be too broad, and siblings like diagnostic lens without condensing specificity or fundus contact lenses would be incorrect. No extra attributes are added beyond the diagnostic condensing nature."
697771010000109,Immunoglobulin E antibody to Malassezia (substance),IgE recognizing Malassezia,"This denotes an IgE antibody that recognizes Malassezia antigens (i.e., the antigen-specific antibody substance). It aligns to the Substance concept 'Immunoglobulin E antibody to Malassezia'. There is no test outcome or clinical interpretation, so observable or finding hierarchies should not be used. The term 'recognizing' is an accepted immunologic synonym for antigen binding and retains identical specificity."
364041009,Arytenoid observable (observable entity),Arytenoid parameter,"Describing the arytenoid as a 'parameter' denotes a variable to be observed or recorded, aligning with the Observable entity class rather than a finding or procedure. This maps to Arytenoid observable (SCTID: 364041009) because it establishes the arytenoid as the subject of an observable without specifying what is measured. The synonym 'parameter' is a neutral descriptor of observables and does not imply laterality, abnormality, or specific attributes that would require a more granular child concept. Broader laryngeal or cartilage observables would be less precise targets for this wording."
1352762008,Union for International Cancer Control ycT1b2 (qualifier value),TNM T-class per UICC: ycT1b2 (clinical after therapy),"This indicates the UICC TNM T classification ycT1b2 with clinical post-therapy context, matching the 'yc' prefix. The main concept is the qualifier ycT1b2; in SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value and maps to SCTID 1352762008. Parent or sibling qualifiers (ycT1b, cT1b2, ypT1b2) are not correct for the specified designation. The entry avoids extra attributes such as site or size, maintaining precision."
223496003,Geographical and/or political region of the world (geographic location),Geographical or political region of the world,"Main concept: a region of the world defined by geography or politics. No specific region is identified and no further attributes are provided. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). This is a direct synonym of the preferred term (“and/or” expressed as “or” without changing meaning in this context). Broader parents would not constrain to region-level, and more specific children (named regions) are not indicated. The absence of administrative or jurisdictional detail supports SCTID 223496003 as the exact match."
214131008,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision with another motor vehicle, abandoned on highway, occupant of tram injured (event)",Problem list: motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision with another motor vehicle abandoned on highway; tram occupant injured.,"This problem-list entry records an Event where a tram occupant was injured due to a traffic accident with collision involving an abandoned motor vehicle on a highway. Attributes include motor vehicle traffic accident, collision with another motor vehicle, the other vehicle being abandoned, highway setting, and the injured tram occupant role. SCTID 214131008 is the most specific Event code aligning with these details. Using a parent like generic 'motor vehicle accident' or a sibling for a different vehicle or location would be inaccurate. The phrasing remains faithful and adds no extraneous qualifiers."
446952006,Specimen from skin obtained by scraping (specimen),Skin scraping collected (specimen),"This denotes a specimen consisting of skin material collected by scraping, which matches “Specimen from skin obtained by scraping” (SCTID 446952006). Category: Specimen. It is not a general skin specimen and not a different-method specimen like a swab or biopsy. The parenthetical clarifies that the focus is the specimen, and the entry does not add attributes such as location or diagnostic intent."
223869006,Cheshire (geographic location),Residence: Cheshire,"The statement is a documentation context indicating residence, with the core concept being the place name Cheshire. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). This aligns with SCTID 223869006 as it denotes the specific county. Using a parent region (England) or a subregion (Cheshire East or Chester) would not capture the exact location referenced. The context label “Residence:” does not alter the location concept; it remains the geographic entity."
258516004,Frenulum of penis swab (specimen),Documentation: swab collected at penile frenulum,"This entry documents that a swab was collected at the penile frenulum, i.e., a swab specimen from that site. Attributes explicitly include swab type and penile frenulum source. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It correctly maps to SCTID 258516004, the site-specific swab specimen. Broader parent codes omit the subsite detail, and sibling concepts pointing to other penile structures would misidentify the location. The wording is a clinical paraphrase with equivalent meaning."
386681007,Aircraft accident (event),Case summary: aircraft accident,"A case summary referencing 'aircraft accident' points to the SNOMED Event concept Aircraft accident (event), SCTID 386681007. The entry is free of added details such as mechanism or subtype, making it more precise than generic accident categories and not specific enough to warrant a child like Aircraft crash or Airplane accident."
16214571000119105,Specimen from left lower lobe of lung obtained by endobronchial biopsy (specimen),Specimen source: endobronchial biopsy of left lower lobe,"The text describes the source of the specimen as an endobronchial biopsy of the left lower lobe, specifying both site and method. This is a Specimen concept and best matches “Specimen from left lower lobe of lung obtained by endobronchial biopsy (specimen)” (SCTID 16214571000119105). Parent or generic lung specimens lack the method detail, and sibling concepts like transbronchial biopsy specimens are inconsistent with “endobronchial.” The wording remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term without adding extra attributes."
225142006,Checking dressing for leakage (procedure),Dressing leakage check,"The entry denotes a check specifically for leakage of a dressing, which is a procedural action. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Code 225142006 is the most accurate match because it encodes the exact act of checking a dressing for leakage. Broader or different activities, like changing dressings or monitoring a wound, would not capture the specific intent. The phrasing is a compact synonym, maintaining equivalence to the preferred term without adding attributes."
438960000,Specimen from intervertebral disc (specimen),Specimen source: intervertebral disc,"This formulation clarifies that the specimen’s source is the intervertebral disc. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to SCTID 438960000 as it specifies the anatomical origin without method or regional qualifiers. More general parent concepts are less precise, and siblings/children representing other sources or method-specific specimens are not supported by the wording."
160273004,No family history: Hypertension (situation),Patient reports no relatives with hypertension.,"The patient’s report negates hypertension among their relatives, which corresponds to a negative family history for hypertension. Attributes: family history context via 'relatives' and negation. SNOMED CT category: Situation (Situation with explicit context). This aligns exactly with SCTID 160273004. A parent such as 'No family history of disease' is too general, while a sibling 'Family history of hypertension' is opposite in polarity. No particular subtype or specific relationship degree is mentioned, so no child concept is indicated."
161954000,Hiccough present (situation),Hiccup observed,"The entry indicates a hiccup was observed, asserting presence of the finding. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 161954000 is appropriate because it encodes presence explicitly, with no added attributes like severity or duration. A pure finding concept lacks explicit presence context, and alternative situations indicating absence or historical context would not match the text."
257624004,Hill (environment),Groundform: hill,"The term 'groundform' is a synonymic label for landform and does not alter the concept; the feature specified is 'hill'. Main concept: hill. SNOMED CT category: Environment (environmental/geographical location). This matches 'Hill (environment)' [257624004]. Parent categories would be too general, and related siblings (e.g., 'ridge', 'hillside') are not referenced, maintaining precision."
224829003,Sidewalk (environment),Site type: sidewalk,"This structured entry states the site type as sidewalk, focusing solely on the environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It codes to 224829003 Sidewalk (environment). Parent concepts (e.g., pedestrian area) are less specific, and siblings (e.g., street, curb) represent different locations. No causative or severity attributes are present."
413401002,Acetobacter estunensis (organism),Microbial species: Acetobacter estunensis,"This entry presents Acetobacter estunensis as a microbial species, which is strictly taxonomic. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact match is 413401002. The language does not add attributes like infection, location, or resistance—only the species name. More general parent concepts (genus-level or bacteria) are not as precise, and no evidence supports any child concept such as strain or subtype."
242026001,Asphyxia by circumferential chest wall tumor (event),Forensic summary: asphyxia by circumferential chest wall tumor,"This describes an asphyxia event with the cause being a circumferential chest wall tumor; the forensic context does not introduce additional attributes such as outcome or timing. It contains the necessary cause, site, and circumferential qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the exact code match is 242026001. Parent concepts without the etiologic detail or sibling causes (e.g., external compression not due to tumor) would miscode the scenario. The entry remains within the defined concept."
1179568008,Structure of third costocorporeal joint (body structure),Anatomical site: costocorporeal joint of the third rib,"The entry identifies the anatomical site as the costocorporeal joint at the third rib, i.e., the articulation of the rib head with the vertebral body. This is a Body structure concept. It correctly maps to Structure of third costocorporeal joint and does not add pathology or other attributes. A broader costovertebral parent would be less specific, and the costotransverse sibling is excluded because the vertebral body (corporeal) articulation is explicitly referenced."
396926000,Type of study performed on tumor specimen (observable entity),Registry variable: type of study performed on tumor specimen,"This text denotes a registry data field capturing the type of study on a tumor specimen, consistent with the observable entity concept. As an Observable entity, it represents a categorical variable rather than a procedure or outcome. The explicit tumor specimen context maps to SNOMED CT 396926000. There is no specification of study modality, preventing misclassification to more specific child concepts. The wording mirrors the preferred term and preserves exact code selection."
170911003,High risk treatment started (situation),Commenced high-risk treatment,"The wording indicates that a high-risk treatment has been commenced, with 'commenced' synonymous with 'started'. The concept category is Situation. It selects 'High risk treatment started (situation)' as the most precise code because it describes initiation of high-risk treatment without specifying type or adding extra attributes. Other statuses such as planned or discontinued are not present, and generic treatment-started codes would be less specific."
258487003,Fecal smear (specimen),Feces smear specimen,"This entry states that the specimen is a smear of feces, directly aligning with the Specimen category. SCTID 258487003 is the correct code since it specifies both material and preparation. Parent terms like “feces specimen” are too general and sibling terms such as “fecal culture specimen” or “rectal smear” refer to different specimen types or sources not mentioned here."
470518004,Knee continuous passive motion exerciser (physical object),Knee continuous passive motion device (CPM),"This refers to a device providing continuous passive motion for the knee, explicitly noted as CPM, which is a Physical object (device). The knee anatomical target makes SCTID 470518004 the exact match. The abbreviation “CPM” is a standard synonym for continuous passive motion and does not change semantics. Without the knee qualifier, the concept would be a parent CPM device; devices for other joints are siblings."
90573006,Amphibolurus (organism),Specimen tag: Amphibolurus,"This indicates the organism name on a tag is Amphibolurus, referring to the genus-level organism and mapping to SNOMED CT Organism concept 90573006. No species or other attributes are introduced. Selecting a parent concept would be less specific, and a child species would be too specific for the wording. The context of labeling does not alter the underlying genus identification."
1186911009,History of carcinoma of tongue (situation),Personal history of tongue carcinoma,"This entry conveys that the patient personally had carcinoma of the tongue in the past. The central concept is historical tongue carcinoma, with the attribute of past context. It belongs to the Situation with explicit context category. SCTID 1186911009 matches this exactly. Choosing a disorder concept for active tongue carcinoma would be incorrect given the explicit history wording, and using a broader history like malignant neoplasm of tongue would remove the carcinoma specificity. The synonym “tongue carcinoma” is clinically equivalent to “carcinoma of tongue” and does not alter code selection."
127469001,Specimen from pancreas (specimen),Origin of specimen: pancreas,"This wording indicates that the specimen’s anatomical origin is the pancreas, with no additional descriptors. The main concept is a specimen originating from the pancreas. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The most precise code is Specimen from pancreas (specimen) [127469001]. Parents are overly broad, and children or siblings that specify material type (tissue, fluid) or anatomical subparts would not align with the general phrasing here."
64932004,Filaroides osleri (organism),Organism: Filaroides osleri,"The entry explicitly labels the entity as an organism and specifies the species Filaroides osleri, with no other attributes. The main concept is the organism identity, fitting the SNOMED CT category Organism. This aligns exactly with SCTID 64932004. Parent concepts (e.g., genus or higher-level worms) are too broad, and sibling species are different taxa. This wording does not assert infection or clinical findings, so disorder or finding codes are less appropriate."
223699004,The Bahamas (geographic location),Commonwealth of The Bahamas,"This is the official state name of the same country and remains a clinically equivalent synonym for the geographic location. It maps to SNOMED CT 223699004 because it denotes the identical geopolitical entity and does not imply nationality, residency, or any other attribute. Parent concepts (e.g., Caribbean) or children (e.g., specific islands like New Providence) are not indicated. Category: Location (geographic location)."
90771006,Structure of superior mesenteric vein (body structure),Anatomical structure: superior mesenteric vein,"This entry labels the superior mesenteric vein as an anatomical structure, which corresponds to the Body structure hierarchy concept SCTID 90771006. It does not imply any clinical condition, imaging finding, or procedural context beyond identifying the vessel. Parent concepts like ‘mesenteric vein’ are too broad, and siblings such as the inferior mesenteric vein are not intended. It does not point to child concepts (e.g., SMV branches), ensuring the exact match to the given concept."
214673001,"Nontraffic accident involving being hit by motor-driven snow vehicle, pedestrian injured (event)","Imaging indication: Pedestrian struck by snowmobile, nontraffic accident.","As an imaging indication, this notes a pedestrian struck by a snowmobile in a nontraffic accident. The core concept is an Event. It precisely fits SCTID 214673001 due to the nontraffic setting, the motor-driven snow vehicle, and the pedestrian being hit. Generic nontraffic accidents or traffic variants would be less accurate. The terminology mirrors clinical usage and maintains equivalence without adding attributes beyond the concept."
1144283009,Arginine intake (observable entity),Arginine intake metric,"‘Metric’ denotes that arginine intake is being measured or tracked, still referring to the same observable concept without giving values or timeframes. Category: Observable entity. The best match remains SCTID 1144283009. Broader parents like Nutrient intake do not specify arginine, and other observables (e.g., arginine concentration in plasma) or clinical findings (deficiency/excess) are not indicated."
15838006,Snail (organism),Recorded organism value: snail,"The organism value recorded is “snail,” directly pointing to the organism concept. It does not introduce environmental, exposure, or species details. Parent taxonomic categories like Gastropoda are broader, and child concepts specifying habitat are narrower than stated. The best fit remains Snail (organism), SCTID 15838006."
439480002,Genus Thermosphaera (organism),Taxonomic classification—Thermosphaera genus,"Framed as a classification statement, this entry presents Thermosphaera at genus rank, matching the Organism concept Genus Thermosphaera (SCTID 439480002). It avoids clinical findings or procedural attributes, ensuring it does not map to infection-related concepts or to child species or parent taxa. The wording is a safe, synonymous representation of the genus."
117985004,Measurement of Trichomonas vaginalis antibody (procedure),Trichomonas vaginalis antibody test,"This entry denotes a test that measures antibodies to Trichomonas vaginalis and does not introduce specifics about assay method, isotype, specimen, or result. Category: Procedure. The phrase “antibody test” is clinically equivalent to “antibody measurement,” supporting SCTID 117985004. It is more specific than parent concepts of general antibody testing, and does not imply sibling procedures like antigen detection or nucleic acid amplification. It avoids child-level detail such as IgG/IgM subclass testing."
215484007,Ship sinking - swimmer injured (event),Follow-up entry: ship sinking — swimmer injured,"Despite the follow-up context, the content strictly encodes a ship sinking with a swimmer injured, avoiding added details like timing or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The substantive phrase aligns with SCTID 215484007. The “follow-up” label is contextual and does not change the event being coded; broader or alternate injured-party events would not fit this wording."
16210211000119107,Body fluid specimen obtained via cystostomy tube (specimen),Body fluid collected from the suprapubic catheter,"The entry indicates body fluid collected from a suprapubic catheter, which is synonymous with a cystostomy tube. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This matches SCTID 16210211000119107 by documenting a body fluid specimen and the cystostomy (suprapubic) collection route, without specifying the fluid subtype. Parent body fluid specimens are less precise, and a urine-specific child concept is not warranted because urine isn't named. Other catheter routes are not implied."
179412008,Hybrid unicompartmental knee replacement (procedure),"Unicompartmental knee replacement, hybrid fixation","The entry specifies a knee replacement limited to one compartment and uses hybrid fixation, directly aligning with Hybrid unicompartmental knee replacement. Category: Procedure. The phrase is precise and does not imply total knee replacement or specify compartment laterality, nor does it introduce cement-only or uncemented-only fixation that would indicate a different sibling concept. Therefore, SCTID 179412008 is the exact match."
465512004,Surgical binding material anchor (physical object),Surgical anchor for binding material,"The entry identifies an anchor used in surgical contexts to secure binding material; it refers to the physical object without specifying material subtype or anatomical placement. Category: Physical object. Surgical binding material anchor (465512004) is the most precise match, as it explicitly links anchor function to surgical binding material. A broader anchor device would be nonspecific, and a narrower child like a suture anchor would add detail not present. Clip or staple devices are different fastening modalities and thus incorrect. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym that preserves intent."
707709002,Ninety minutes after resting (qualifier value),Post-rest 90-minute mark,"The phrase designates the '90-minute mark' occurring 'post-rest', which clearly represents ninety minutes after resting. The concept is a temporal qualifier with a precise duration and reference to rest. It is in the Qualifier value category. SCTID 707709002 matches exactly, as it denotes 'ninety minutes after resting'. Parent concepts like 'after resting' are less specific, and sibling terms denoting other marks (e.g., 30-minute mark) would miscode. 'Post-rest' and 'mark' are stylistic synonyms that do not alter the temporal semantics."
1204488001,Faroe Islands (geographic location),Documented locale: Faroe Islands,"‘Documented locale’ with ‘Faroe Islands’ denotes the geographic location in a recording context. The category is Geographic location, matching Faroe Islands (geographic location) SCTID 1204488001. The entry does not introduce administrative, demographic, or temporal attributes, nor does it specify a child locality within the islands, so other hierarchy levels are not preferable. The contextual label does not alter the underlying location concept."
362026005,Entire cusp of aortic valve (body structure),Entire cusp of aortic valve,"The entry explicitly matches the FSN, indicating the whole anatomical leaflet (cusp) of the aortic valve and nothing else. This is a Body structure concept. Because it uses the FSN wording, it maps exactly to Entire cusp of aortic valve (362026005) and excludes broader parent structures and more specific child structures. No clinical findings or procedural attributes are added. This direct articulation ensures the most precise coding without ambiguity."
271754008,Rapid fall of fever (finding),Fever dropped quickly,"“Dropped quickly” conveys rapidity and direction (downward) of the fever change, fitting Rapid fall of fever (271754008). The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. No other attributes, such as resolution, etiology, or numeric values, are introduced. A non-rapid drop or a general temperature decrease would be less exact, while resolution implies a different endpoint. Therefore, the phrase uniquely maps to the target concept."
54467009,Watsonius (organism),Watsonius genus,"This entry conveys the genus-level organism Watsonius, clearly a taxonomic reference rather than a clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the concept Watsonius (organism) SCTID 54467009 is the exact match. It neither introduces species details nor any disease or presence statements, so children like specific species and parents like Trematoda are less accurate. The term is a clinically equivalent way to denote the genus and does not alter code selection."
282689007,Ability to push and pull a large wheeled toy forwards (observable entity),Capability: push and pull a large wheeled toy forwards,"The entry states capability, synonymous with ability, to push and pull a large wheeled toy forwards. It includes both actions, the large wheeled toy, and the forward direction, making it an Observable entity. SCTID 282689007 directly corresponds to this defined capability. Parent concepts that are more general or omit direction are less precise; siblings that change the action set or direction do not match. Using 'capability' does not introduce additional attributes beyond the intended observable."
215468006,Submersion and drowning due to jumping from crushed watercraft (event),Submersion and drowning due to jumping from crushed watercraft,"The entry explicitly states submersion and drowning and the causal mechanism of jumping from a crushed watercraft, which exactly matches SNOMED CT concept 215468006 in the Event category. It does not introduce timing, intent, severity, or outcomes beyond the defined event. More general parent concepts like “Submersion and drowning (event)” lack the specified cause, and siblings such as “Submersion and drowning due to jumping from watercraft” do not include the ‘crushed’ attribute. The phrasing is a direct restatement of the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
1179122001,Safe environment (finding),Clinician documents environment safe.,"The clinician’s documentation directly notes a safe environment, expressing the Clinical finding mapped to 'Safe environment (finding)' SCTID 1179122001. No additional context such as location, severity, or timing is included that would prompt a more specific code. It is not an intervention or recommendation, avoiding other hierarchies. The wording is a straightforward paraphrase and remains equivalent to the preferred term without altering code choice."
310164003,Plastic surgery service (qualifier value),Service: Plastic surgery,"The entry specifies the service type as plastic surgery, framed in a common documentation format (“Service: ...”). The concept category is Qualifier value, and 310164003 best represents the service designation. Parent concepts (e.g., Service [qualifier]) are overly broad, and sibling services are different clinical domains. The wording does not introduce procedural actions (e.g., consult) or organizational entities (e.g., department), ensuring it maps uniquely to the plastic surgery service qualifier."
346665001,Renal/liver failure/ketogen food (product),Nutrition product: renal/liver failure/ketogenic food,"This entry indicates a nutrition product specifically labeled as renal/liver failure/ketogenic food, focusing on the product classification. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It is the most precise match to SCTID 346665001 because the triad of indications for the food product is preserved, and the wording does not imply a clinical disorder or a diet regimen. Using 'nutrition product' is a clinically safe synonym for a medical food. Parent categories are too broad, while siblings like disorder codes or dietary regimens would be inappropriate given the product context."
705777000,Dental bur (physical object),Imaging report narrative: dental bur,"The phrase situates 'dental bur' within an imaging report narrative without adding attributes like retention or foreign body status. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It names the object only and does not transform it into a finding or complication. Consequently, the precise code is Dental bur (705777000), not a broader device concept or any child subtype of bur."
427964002,History of tympanostomy (situation),Previous tympanotomy noted in medical history,"Tympanotomy is commonly used interchangeably with tympanostomy to denote incision into the tympanic membrane; 'previous' sets the historical context. This is a Situation with explicit context. The correct code is 427964002 (History of tympanostomy). Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts referencing other procedures (e.g., tympanoplasty or tube insertion) are not stated."
181600006,Structure of nail bed of third toe (body structure),Target anatomy: nail bed of third toe,"The entry identifies the anatomical 'target' as the nail bed of the third toe, but does not introduce any procedural action or pathology. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 181600006 is the correct code because the structure is the third toe nail bed. A parent concept like generic toe nail bed is less precise, and sibling concepts for other toes or nail components are incongruent with this anatomy."
224817007,Coastal environment (environment),Coastal community environment,"The phrase describes an environment within a community situated on or near the coast, which is an environmental type. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 224817007 is ideal because it represents coastal environment without implying narrower entities like beach fronts or marine offshore settings. A broader parent environment concept would omit the coastal characteristic. The term “community” indicates social context but does not add non-environmental attributes or change the environmental subtype. Consequently, 224817007 is the most accurate and specific code."
76433001,"Apron, device (physical object)",Apron available in procedure room,"This indicates the availability of an apron as an object, with no added material or function, fitting Apron, device (physical object) SCTID 76433001. Main concept: apron device; context: location and availability only. Category: Physical object (Device). Children such as protective aprons are excluded because protection is not stated, and siblings like gowns are not referenced. The phrase remains an unmodified mention of an apron device."
16090571000119109,Occupational exposure to toxic agent (event),Incident: occupational exposure to toxic agent,"The entry labels an incident involving occupational exposure to a toxic agent. Principal elements: exposure event, toxic agent, occupational context. Category: Event. The code Occupational exposure to toxic agent (event) exactly matches, as it represents an occurrence in the workplace without specifying agent type, route, or effects. A parent exposure event lacks the occupational element, while child or sibling concepts that specify environmental exposures or specific substances would be misaligned. Using “incident” underscores event nature and does not change the clinical meaning or introduce new attributes."
424972008,Structure of subtendinous bursa of posterior tibial muscle (body structure),Imaging label: tibialis posterior tendon subtendinous bursa,"As an imaging label, this specifies the subtendinous bursa associated with the tibialis posterior tendon, with no additional findings or laterality. It is a Body structure; SCTID 424972008 is the exact match. General bursa codes are insufficiently specific, and adjacent structures (tendon, sheath) are different. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym emphasizing the tendon relationship that defines a subtendinous bursa."
223664003,England (geographic location),Travel destination: England,"This entry indicates England as the destination, with the codable entity being the geographic location England. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). England (geographic location) SCTID 223664003 is the correct code because it directly represents the named place. More general parent concepts like United Kingdom would not be as precise, and child concepts (regions or cities within England) are not specified. The context 'Travel destination' frames usage but does not change the underlying location being encoded."
224869002,Adult education college (environment),Adult education college context,"This entry presents 'adult education college' as the contextual environment, without implying any additional details. The category is Environment or geographical location (environment). The selected code is Adult education college (environment) SCTID 224869002 because the phrase denotes a college serving adult learners. Mapping to a parent concept like Educational institution (environment) would be less specific, and siblings such as University (environment) or Adult education center (environment) are not equivalent. The word 'context' does not change the environment type."
257359005,Cone pattern tongs (physical object),Cone pattern tongs selected for use,The phrase indicates selection for use while naming the object as “cone pattern tongs.” It does not introduce attributes like dimensions or locking mechanisms. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 257359005 precisely captures this item; mapping to a parent like tongs (unspecified) or to a sibling such as forceps would be inappropriate. The selection context is neutral and does not change the concept.
223832008,Rhodes (geographic location),Rhodes (geographic location),"This entry explicitly states the place name and its type, aligning exactly with Rhodes (geographic location), SCTID 223832008. The main concept is a geographical place; no timing, cause, severity, or sublocation is introduced. The category is Qualifier value (Geographic location). Including the parenthetical phrase does not change the code selection; it reinforces that the term refers to the location concept rather than any entity named “Rhodes.” Parent concepts like Geographic location are too broad, and sibling or child concepts (e.g., Rhodes city or specific neighborhoods) are not referenced, ensuring precise mapping."
702846002,Dental clinic (environment),Dental care clinic,"This wording indicates a clinic providing dental care, which is an environment described as a dental clinic. The concept is an Environment or geographical location, and the most precise SNOMED CT code is Dental clinic (environment) 702846002. Generic clinic concepts lack dental specificity, and specialty variants (e.g., pediatric dental clinic) are not stated. The phrase is a safe synonym without introducing organizational qualifiers."
1156478007,Graf classification (observable entity),Graf classification captured,"The text indicates the Graf classification observation was captured, with no result details or extra attributes. The concept is an Observable entity, mapping to SCTID 1156478007. Parents are overly general, and children/siblings like Graf type categories or alternative classification frameworks are not specified. The documentation verb does not shift it to a procedure; it remains an observable classification."
1381775002,Phytate intake (observable entity),Phytate intake recorded in diet log,"This contextualizes the observable within a diet log, still naming phytate intake directly. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It precisely matches 1381775002 by specifying intake of phytate without quantifying, categorizing, or timing it. General diet log entries are too broad (parent), and siblings are other nutrient intakes. The wording does not add attributes beyond the intake variable."
1352600009,Union for International Cancer Control rpN0(i+) (qualifier value),UICC rpN0(i+),"The entry explicitly records the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM recurrent pathological nodal category rpN0(i+). The attributes present are: the recurrent prefix r, pathological assessment p, nodal status N0 (no regional nodal metastasis), and the suffix (i+) indicating isolated tumor cells present. In SNOMED CT this is a Qualifier value used to specify the nodal component of UICC TNM staging. This wording precisely matches SCTID 1352600009. Parent concepts such as UICC rpN0 without (i+) lose the isolated tumor cell detail, while sibling concepts like UICC pN0(i+) omit the recurrent prefix. Any alternative with N1/N2/N3 would incorrectly imply metastatic nodal involvement."
420605004,Greek letter zeta (qualifier value),Greek letter zeta identified,"The core concept is identification of the Greek letter zeta, which is a Qualifier value. SNOMED CT code 420605004 fits precisely. 'Identified' is contextual and does not change the concept. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings (other Greek letters) are not implicated by the text."
263756000,Fibrosis (qualifier value),Imaging descriptor chosen: fibrosis,"Although situated in an imaging context, 'fibrosis' is presented as a descriptor (i.e., a qualifier value), not as a radiologic diagnosis or morphologic entity. The correct category is Qualifier value, mapping to 263756000. Morphologic abnormality or disease codes would imply a pathologic finding, which the entry does not state. The descriptor framing keeps the semantics at the qualifier level."
390783005,Exeter total hip prosthesis (physical object),Implant catalog entry: Exeter total hip prosthesis,"The wording presents a catalog listing for the Exeter total hip prosthesis, clearly referring to the device as a Physical object. The best SNOMED CT match is Exeter total hip prosthesis (390783005). The catalog context does not change the concept or add clinical attributes. A broader device category like Total hip prosthesis would be less precise, and sibling entries describing different models or partial hip devices would be incorrect. The term captures the complete total hip prosthesis rather than a component."
425994007,Oxygen mist tent (physical object),Device name: aerosolized oxygen tent,"This entry uses a device name context and specifies an aerosolized (mist) oxygen tent, which corresponds to the oxygen mist tent. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). The best match is Oxygen mist tent (425994007). Parent concepts are broader and siblings like a generic oxygen tent or oxygen hood do not match the mist/humidified tent specification. The context label and synonym do not introduce any additional attributes."
37010006,Tetraphylline (substance),Medication ingredient name: tetraphylline,"This wording explicitly names tetraphylline as the ingredient of a medication, which refers to the substance itself rather than a particular product. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the exact concept Tetraphylline (substance). A product code would be incorrect because the entry does not specify formulation or dose. Parent ingredient categories are too broad, and siblings are other distinct compounds. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
391067006,Hip dual energy X-ray photon absorptiometry scan Z score (observable entity),Hip DXA Z-score result label,"The phrase identifies the label for the result metric: the hip DXA Z score. The main concept is the observable Z score from a hip DXA scan, matching SNOMED CT 391067006. It is not a general DXA Z score (parent) nor a sibling like T score or femoral neck measures. The entry does not add numeric result values or interpretations; 'result label' contextualizes usage without changing the underlying observable entity."
411726001,Cow's milk protein diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen preparation: bovine milk protein extract,"The entry identifies a diagnostic allergen preparation comprised of bovine (cow) milk protein extract. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). 'Bovine' is clinically equivalent to 'cow', and the diagnostic qualifier ensures it matches SCTID 411726001. It distinguishes from non-specific products and from therapeutic allergen extracts. The wording avoids introducing method, dose, or formulation details beyond the diagnostic product identity."
223908000,Wiltshire (geographic location),Region specified: Wiltshire,"The key concept is the specified region being “Wiltshire,” mapping directly to SNOMED CT 223908000 Wiltshire (geographic location). Category: Location. The label “Region specified” is contextual and does not alter the underlying location being coded. Broader or different regions (England, Somerset, Salisbury) are not referenced, and the entry avoids adding any clinical or temporal attributes, keeping the concept purely geographic."
373481003,Tolbutamide (substance),Tolbutamide (exact substance match),"This explicitly calls for the substance-level identification of tolbutamide. The proper SNOMED CT mapping is Tolbutamide (substance), SCTID 373481003. Category: Substance. No formulation, strength, or therapeutic action is present, excluding product or procedure concepts. Broader groupings (e.g., sulfonylurea class) lack molecule specificity."
263782009,Inaccurate (qualifier value),Assessment: inaccurate,"The phrase indicates that the assessment outcome for accuracy is 'inaccurate', which is the Qualifier value 'Inaccurate' (263782009). No cause, severity, timing, or other attributes are introduced. Choosing a parent would reduce specificity, and sibling qualifiers like 'accurate' or 'valid' would contradict the statement. 'Assessment' is a context label; the coded term remains 'inaccurate'."
302417005,Removal of glass from skin (procedure),Clinic note: removal of glass from skin,"This clinic documentation records the procedure of removing glass from the skin, with material and site specified. Category: Procedure. SCTID 302417005 is the exact match. The clinical context (‘clinic note’) does not change the procedure. Parent concepts that do not specify glass and sibling concepts for wounds or other sites are less appropriate given the explicit reference to glass and skin."
405695004,Strait jacket placed for legal restraint (situation),Observation note: strait jacket fitted for legal restraint.,"The observation context does not alter the clinical meaning: a strait jacket fitted for the purpose of legal restraint. Category: Situation. SCTID 405695004 is exact because it identifies both the device and legal indication. Parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling concepts focused on medical restraint or other devices would be incorrect. 'Fitted' is a valid synonym for placement without adding new attributes."
224068009,Minnesota (geographic location),Jurisdiction: Minnesota,"The label 'Jurisdiction:' is administrative context, while the value identifies the state Minnesota. Main concept: Minnesota as an administrative geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. Minnesota (geographic location), SCTID 224068009, is precise. A legal or governmental concept would add semantics not present here; likewise broader country or narrower municipal units would be miscodes. The phrasing is equivalent for coding the state."
727104009,Entire zona fasciculata of adrenal gland (body structure),Entire adrenal gland fasciculata layer,"The wording specifies the fasciculata layer and anchors it to the adrenal gland, with “entire” indicating the whole layer. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This best matches “Entire zona fasciculata of adrenal gland,” excluding parent concepts and other cortical layers, and it is more exact than the non-entire fasciculata entry due to the explicit completeness."
228732000,Beam direction shell (physical object),Direction shell for beam,"A re-ordered phrasing that remains semantically equivalent to 'Beam direction shell.' It identifies the same physical object without inferring additional functionality or clinical context. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and code 228732000 best fits. Broader parent concepts lack specificity, while sibling devices (collimators, compensators, immobilization shells) are not referenced, so this entry maps to the exact concept."
701883000,Cerebrospinal fluid pressure regulation system (physical object),CSF pressure regulation device system,"This phrasing explicitly characterizes the object as a device system that regulates CSF pressure, which fits the Physical object category. It avoids implying any procedural action, presence finding, or subtype such as shunt valves. Monitoring or drainage are not mentioned, preventing mapping to siblings. SCTID 701883000 is the most precise code for this wording."
398999006,Uncompensated swallowing impairment (finding),Swallowing impairment—uncompensated,"This entry directly states a swallowing impairment with the qualifier 'uncompensated,' meaning compensatory strategies are not effective. It is a Clinical finding and matches SNOMED CT 398999006. A parent concept without the uncompensated qualifier would be less precise, and competing sibling concepts like 'Compensated swallowing impairment' do not fit. No severity, cause, or timing is implied."
795002,Deep (qualifier value),Patient states: deep,"As a patient-reported descriptor, 'deep' still functions purely as a qualitative depth value and should be coded as Deep (qualifier value) [795002]. The statement does not introduce a condition or body site, so it remains in the qualifier value hierarchy. Parent values are too general, and other depth descriptors (siblings) are not indicated. No extra attributes (severity, timing, laterality) are included."
1296949006,Fear of body smell (finding),Patient endorses fear of body odor,"This entry states that the patient affirms having fear of body odor, aligning directly with the concept of fear of body smell, with no added attributes. Category: Clinical finding. The precise code is 1296949006 Fear of body smell (finding). Using a general parent like Fear (finding) is too non-specific, and sibling entries like Fear of smell (finding) do not limit the fear to body-related odor. 'Body odor' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'body smell,' so the code remains unchanged."
463486006,Nystagmus inducing tape (physical object),OKN striped stimulus tape,"This describes a striped tape serving as an optokinetic (OKN) visual stimulus, i.e., the nystagmus-inducing tape. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It maps precisely to SCTID 463486006; sibling items such as drums or charts are different physical objects. Using ‘stimulus’ and ‘striped’ reflects typical features without changing the underlying device concept."
45313004,Product containing propylpiperazine derivative of phenothiazine (product),Pharmacy order for a propylpiperazine derivative of phenothiazine product,"This is an order context specifying the product’s content: a propylpiperazine derivative of phenothiazine. The main concept remains a medicinal product by ingredient class. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). It precisely matches SCTID 45313004, as the phrase “propylpiperazine derivative of phenothiazine” is the defining characteristic. A broader parent like “phenothiazine derivative product” would lose specificity, while naming a single compound would incorrectly target a child. The order context adds no clinical attributes about dose or route, so the class-level product concept is appropriate."
224670004,Houseboat (environment),Accommodation: houseboat,"The entry identifies the accommodation type as a houseboat, capturing the environmental location. No additional clinical or temporal attributes are present. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Houseboat (environment) [224670004] is the correct code; more general accommodations or other vessel types would be less precise."
297695001,Gur language (qualifier value),Telehealth visit in Gur,"The statement specifies the telehealth visit’s language as Gur. The main concept is the language value, best represented by Gur language (297695001) in the Qualifier value category. While the care modality is mentioned, the semantic focus for coding the language remains Gur. The generic parent language concept is underspecified, and sibling languages do not apply, confirming the Gur-specific code."
223659002,Andorra (geographic location),Location: Andorra,"A context label followed by the place name still encodes the geographic entity itself. The concept is Andorra as a geographic location, which belongs to the SNOMED CT Geographic location hierarchy. SCTID 223659002 is appropriate because the named place is clear and unmodified. The prefixed 'Location:' does not introduce additional clinical or temporal attributes, nor does it point to broader parents or narrower children."
1255442007,Structure of ligament of interphalangeal joint of left thumb (body structure),Examined anatomy: left thumb interphalangeal joint ligament,"This indicates the examined anatomical structure is the ligament at the left thumb IP joint, specifying location and laterality only. It is a Body structure. SCTID 1255442007 best matches. Parents that generalize to thumb ligaments or IP joint ligaments without laterality are less precise, and children that include ‘radial’ or ‘ulnar’ collateral types are too specific. The wording is a neutral, equivalent synonym."
408714007,Degree of blood vessel lumen cross sectional area reduction (observable entity),Assessment item: degree of lumen cross-sectional area reduction (blood vessel),"The wording identifies an assessment item measuring the degree of cross-sectional area reduction of a blood vessel lumen. This is an observable entity, and 408714007 is the exact match. Parent concepts are too general, while siblings (diameter reduction or stenosis severity) and children (location-specific area reduction) would add attributes not present here."
408439002,Allergy specialty (qualifier value),Specialty used for this case: Allergy,"This entry reports Allergy as the specialty used, representing a clinical specialty qualifier. No procedural, diagnostic, or occupational information is introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, with 408439002 Allergy specialty being the exact choice. Mapping to Clinical specialty alone would be nonspecific, and selecting Immunology or Allergy and immunology would add unstated scope. The context about the case does not alter the specialty concept."
714421002,Difficulty agreeing with care plan (finding),Follow-up visit note: difficulty agreeing with care plan,"This follow-up note records the Clinical finding of difficulty agreeing with the care plan, precisely matching SNOMED CT 714421002. The context does not introduce additional attributes and the wording avoids refusal, disagreement, or nonadherence implications. Parent categories are too general and sibling concepts would misstate the nature of the finding. The entry is a direct representation of the specified concept."
223551007,Zimbabwe (geographic location),Zimbabwe — geographic location,"The phrase specifies Zimbabwe and labels it as a geographic location, which aligns exactly with the SNOMED concept. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The most accurate code is Zimbabwe (geographic location) SCTID 223551007. Broader categories (e.g., Country) do not capture the specific nation, and related locations (cities or neighboring countries) are different entities. The contextual label does not add any attribute beyond confirming the category."
1157192003,Product containing animal material (product),Product manufactured with animal material,"By stating that the product is manufactured with animal material, the entry conveys the inclusion of animal-derived content. It remains within the Product hierarchy and does not travel into procedure or device specifics. The lack of subtype detail means child concepts would be too specific, and the generic parent would be insufficiently descriptive. This supports use of “Product containing animal material (product)” 1157192003."
61238007,"Creatine kinase isoenzyme, MM fraction (substance)",Creatine kinase MM isoenzyme fraction,"This combines 'isoenzyme' and 'fraction' to emphasize the MM component of CK. Category: Substance. It still refers to the same substance identity as the preferred term, making SCTID 61238007 the exact match. No action, interpretation, or specimen attributes are present. Broader CK isoenzyme concepts lack MM specificity, and MB/BB siblings are excluded by 'MM'."
394964001,No smokers in the household (situation),Lives with nonsmokers; no one at home smokes.,"This phrasing clearly conveys that all cohabitants are nonsmokers, i.e., there are no smokers in the household. The concept is a social Situation describing household smoking status. SNOMED CT code 394964001 No smokers in the household (situation) is the best fit because it precisely captures the absence of smokers among household members. Broader or different concepts like household no-smoking rules or exposure to smoke are not mentioned and would be inaccurate. The paraphrase 'lives with nonsmokers' is semantically equivalent to 'no household smokers.'"
401000124105,Hemodialysis blood flow (observable entity),Dialysis blood flow (hemodialysis),"The wording clarifies that the dialysis modality is hemodialysis, and 'blood flow' here denotes the extracorporeal circuit flow rate. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and the best match is Hemodialysis blood flow (401000124105). Without the hemodialysis qualifier, 'dialysis blood flow' could be ambiguous, but inclusion ensures it does not refer to peritoneal dialysis or dialysate flow. No extra attributes are present."
257687008,Reservoir (environment),Found at the reservoir on arrival,"The entry indicates an arrival location that is a reservoir, pointing to the environmental place without added qualifiers. Category: Environment or geographical location. It best matches Reservoir (environment) [257687008]. The phrase does not imply other water features or infection-related 'reservoirs,' keeping the code selection precise."
362389008,Entire habenula (body structure),Body structure under discussion: entire habenula,"The phrase specifies the entire habenula as the body structure under discussion, which aligns with the Body structure category. SCTID 362389008 precisely matches the whole habenula. It does not imply subdivision, laterality, or adjacent structures; therefore, child/sibling concepts are inappropriate. A parent term missing the 'entire' qualifier would not reflect the explicitly complete structure."
70436001,Palmar fasciectomy with z-plasty (procedure),Z-plasty closure accompanying palmar fasciectomy,"The phrase describes a palmar fasciectomy with an accompanying Z-plasty closure, indicating both parts of the procedure. It is a Procedure and aligns with Palmar fasciectomy with z-plasty (70436001). Using a broader code for fasciectomy alone or a separate Z-plasty procedure would miss the combined nature. The wording introduces no extra attributes like indication, laterality, or extent, keeping the mapping specific."
425254001,Grade 5 on a scale of 0 to 5 (qualifier value),Recorded as 5/5 on a zero-to-five scale,"The phrase '5/5' combined with 'zero-to-five scale' explicitly denotes grade 5 on a 0-5 scale, which maps directly to SNOMED CT 425254001. The main concept is the numeric qualifier value, with no clinical context or attribute added. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The use of 'recorded as' is context of documentation, not a new attribute, and '5/5' is a safe paraphrase of grade 5 on the specified scale. The wording excludes sibling values and scales such as 1-5."
387551000,Ofloxacin (substance),Substance: ofloxacin,"The entry clearly identifies 'ofloxacin' as a substance, excluding implications of product form, dosing, or route. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This maps directly to Ofloxacin (substance), SCTID 387551000. Parent classes or sibling substances are not indicated, and medicinal product variants are not referenced, ensuring the substance concept is the most precise fit."
722173008,Prison based care site (environment),Imaging location: prison-based care site,"The imaging report-style line specifies the location as a prison-based care site, exactly matching Prison based care site (environment) [722173008]. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The wording avoids specifying a particular modality suite or unit, keeping the environment at the correct level. Using a broader care site concept would lose prison specificity, and selecting sibling sites like jail-based care sites would be incorrect."
1172897003,Nonimplantable external ear prosthesis (physical object),Non-implant external auricular prosthesis,"The term 'auricular' is clinically synonymous with external ear/pinna/auricle, and 'non-implant' indicates nonimplantable, pointing precisely to Nonimplantable external ear prosthesis (SCTID 1172897003). The concept is a Physical object (a device) and not a finding or procedure. A parent like Auricular prosthesis without the nonimplant specification would be less precise, while siblings that imply implantation are excluded by the wording. No new attributes such as laterality or purpose are introduced; the synonym does not alter code selection."
725894000,Influenza virus (organism),Virology: influenza virus,"This reads like a virology section header that lists the organism name; it does not claim presence, infection, or type and merely references the organism. Main concept: Influenza virus taxon. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 725894000 is appropriate because the entry denotes the generic influenza virus entity. Choosing a parent like Virus (organism) sacrifices specificity, and selecting a child like Influenza A virus introduces undue specificity. The text does not indicate a finding such as 'detected' or a disorder such as 'influenza.'"
701234007,"Collagen hemostatic agent, antimicrobial (physical object)",Antimicrobial-treated collagen hemostatic agent,"This describes a collagen hemostatic agent that has been treated to provide antimicrobial properties, maintaining the agent’s composition and function. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 701234007 is exact, combining collagen composition with antimicrobial characteristic. Alternatives lacking either attribute (parent/sibling) are less precise. The term “treated” is a paraphrase expressing antimicrobial presence and does not imply procedure or specific formulation, thus not narrowing into a child concept."
223570002,Togo (geographic location),Togo in file,"The entry notes Togo appearing in the file, where the only codable content is the geographic country Togo. This aligns with SNOMED CT Togo (geographic location) SCTID 223570002 in the Location hierarchy. The context ‘in file’ does not add clinical attributes. A parent geographic concept would lack specificity, and any child or sibling geographic concept would be incorrect given the explicit country name."
107271007,Family Cordylidae (organism),Taxonomic family Cordylidae,"The phrase indicates a taxonomic classification and identifies the organism as the Cordylidae family. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Family Cordylidae (organism), SCTID 107271007, is the most precise concept. Broader classes (e.g., lizards generally) or sibling families (e.g., Lacertidae, Scincidae) are not appropriate. The wording introduces no clinical context beyond taxonomy, so it maps uniquely to the family-level organism concept."
728330000,Entire mesial incisal tooth surfaces (body structure),Charted: entire mesioincisal tooth surfaces,This documentation-style entry labels the anatomical structures charted as the entire set of mesioincisal tooth surfaces. The term 'mesioincisal' is a clinically equivalent synonym. It is a Body structure concept that matches SCTID 728330000. The context does not add attributes that change coding; it does not collapse to a parent concept nor introduce child-level specificity. It avoids siblings such as line angles by stating surfaces explicitly.
724239008,Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (substance),Alpha-amino adipic semialdehyde,"This variant spacing around 'amino adipic' still denotes the same chemical, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde, without implying assay results, presence in a specimen, or clinical interpretation. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 724239008 is the exact representation. General parent categories (e.g., aldehydes) or sibling compounds (alpha-aminoadipic acid) do not match the semialdehyde form specified here. No observable or procedural component is mentioned, so the substance concept is correct."
224032004,Ellesmere island (geographic location),Locality noted: Ellesmere Island,"The locality being noted is the specific island “Ellesmere Island.” No additional attributes are asserted. This falls under Location (Geographic location). The exact SNOMED CT code 224032004 matches the named island. More general parents (e.g., Arctic islands) or different siblings are not indicated. The entry expresses the same concept with a neutral recording context."
119361006,Plasma specimen (specimen),Specimen type: plasma,"Here, the specimen type is declared as plasma, which corresponds directly to a plasma specimen. The category is Specimen in SNOMED CT. The most precise code is Plasma specimen (specimen), SCTID 119361006. A parent concept would be less specific, and siblings such as serum specimen would misrepresent the material. No qualifiers like citrate, EDTA, or platelet content are stated, avoiding mapping to child concepts."
412150007,Insect debris (substance),Insect particulate matter,"This entry describes particulate matter originating from insects, which is a semantic equivalent of insect debris and aligns with SNOMED CT 412150007 (Substance). It does not introduce attributes such as species, exposure context, or clinical conditions. Generic particulate matter would be too broad, and species-specific debris would be overly narrow. Hence, the precise concept is Insect debris (substance)."
767318008,Product manufactured as endocervical dose form (product),Medication product designated with endocervical dose form,"The entry describes a medication product designated by an endocervical manufactured dose form, aligning with SNOMED Product 767318008. It does not provide ingredient, strength, or formulation subtype details, preventing misclassification to child concepts. It is not a general dose form parent nor a different sibling dose form; it clearly points to the endocervical manufactured dose form attribute used in product modeling."
1290321001,Hodapp Parrish Anderson glaucoma staging - moderate defect (qualifier value),HPA category: moderate defect,"The entry assigns the HPA category as “moderate defect,” which is the exact qualifier value represented by SCTID 1290321001. The concept is limited to the classification tier under HPA with no additional clinical qualifiers, consistent with the Qualifier value category. Parent concepts (general HPA category) would be underspecified; sibling levels (mild/severe) would not match. The term “category” is semantically equivalent to “staging level” in this context and preserves code selection."
421602008,Ophthalmic bar prism (physical object),Prism bar at examination station,"The main concept is a prism bar located at an examination station; the only specific clinical object is the prism bar. Category: Physical object. This maps to SNOMED CT 421602008 (ophthalmic bar prism) since “prism bar” denotes the bar-format ophthalmic device. The location context does not introduce subtype attributes, so narrower child concepts are avoided. Parents like generic prism tools are not as specific as the bar form."
223546001,South African country (geographic location),Laboratory country: South Africa,"This is a laboratory context field where the country is South Africa, representing the national geographic entity. Category: Geographic location (Location)—Country. The best fit is 223546001, as it denotes the country-level location. Parent concepts are nonspecific, and child localities are not indicated. The context “laboratory” does not add attributes to the country concept and remains equivalent."
223644008,Albania (geographic location),Republic of Albania,"This entry uses the official state name for Albania and refers to the same geographic location. The concept is a Location (Geographic location), and SCTID 223644008 is the exact match for the country. It does not add any clinical or situational attribute; it simply uses an accepted synonym. Parent concepts like Geographic location are too general, and child concepts (cities or administrative subdivisions) are not indicated. Sibling countries are not relevant, making the country-level Albania concept the most precise fit."
1380164004,Assessment of eligibility for social benefits (procedure),Assessment regarding whether the patient meets criteria for social benefits,"This describes an assessment procedure to determine if criteria for social benefits are met. It is a Procedure mapping to SCTID 1380164004. No outcome, program type, or other attributes are provided. Thus, generic parent assessments are too broad, and specificity to a particular benefit or domain (children/siblings) would be inappropriate for this wording."
868262000,Scleral sinus stent (physical object),Ocular Schlemm canal stent,"By stating 'ocular' and 'Schlemm canal stent,' this entry designates the stent for the scleral sinus in the eye. The concept is a Physical object. It aligns with Scleral sinus stent (physical object) SCTID 868262000 due to the explicit anatomical target. Device presence or procedural actions are not indicated, so parent/sibling findings or procedures are less appropriate. The synonym 'Schlemm canal' is clinically equivalent."
219199009,Assault by handgun (event),Assault by handgun,"The main concept explicitly documented is an assault event where a handgun was the instrument used. No additional attributes (injury details, timing, laterality, severity, intent qualifiers) are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with an Event category, specifically SCTID 219199009 Assault by handgun (event). This precise code is preferred over broader parents like Assault by firearm (event) and is more appropriate than sibling concepts such as Assault by shotgun (event) or accidental firearm discharge events. It also avoids misclassification to injury/disorder concepts like gunshot wound. The phrasing directly matches the preferred term, making 219199009 the exact fit."
228489002,Snuff use (observable entity),Snuff use identified,"This indicates identification of the data element ‘snuff use’ during evaluation, remaining focused on the use of snuff. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The appropriate code is Snuff use (228489002). No additional attributes are introduced, so alternative parent or child concepts (e.g., smokeless tobacco use, moist/dry snuff use) are less precise given the lack of generalization or subtype detail."
170100005,Child not examined at birth (situation),"At birth, baby was not assessed.","This entry states the baby was not assessed at birth, capturing the negation of examination at that time point. It belongs to the Situation with explicit context category and matches SCTID 170100005. The timing and subject are explicit, making it more precise than general 'assessment not done' concepts. Siblings like 'Postnatal assessment not performed' could imply a later timeframe than birth. 'Assessed' is clinically equivalent to 'examined' and does not introduce additional attributes, preserving code accuracy."
314940005,Urinary tract infection suspected (situation),Suspected urinary tract infection,"The entry explicitly states urinary tract infection with the qualifier “suspected,” indicating uncertainty but focused consideration of UTI. This is a Situation with explicit context, not a confirmed Disorder. SNOMED CT concept 314940005 (Urinary tract infection suspected) precisely fits because the clinical status is suspicion without confirmation. Using the parent disorder concept (UTI) would inappropriately imply a definitive diagnosis, while child concepts like cystitis or pyelonephritis suspected add site specificity not present here. Siblings such as “UTI ruled out” or screening/evaluation concepts are not indicated by this wording. The phrasing is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not introduce additional attributes."
122058001,Neisseria meningitidis Y antigen assay (procedure),Test for meningococcus Y antigen,"This is a clinician-style phrasing indicating a test focused on the meningococcal Y antigen. 'Meningococcus' equates to Neisseria meningitidis, and specifying Y aligns with the concept. The SNOMED category is Procedure. It avoids details (method, specimen, result). Parent concepts lacking serogroup or sibling methods (e.g., PCR, culture) would not match. The exact code is 122058001."
252324004,Total hemolytic complement titration (alternative) (procedure),Laboratory: AH50 alternative pathway hemolytic complement assay,"This lab-style entry identifies the AH50 assay for alternative pathway hemolytic complement activity. The concept is a Procedure. It fits SNOMED CT 252324004 because it specifies hemolytic complement activity and the alternative pathway, excluding CH50 and general complement tests. The contextual 'Laboratory' label does not alter attributes of the procedure. The synonym remains clinically equivalent without adding timing, specimen, or result details."
349363001,Homeopathic medicine (product),Patient-reported: homeopathic medicine,"This references a homeopathic medicinal product with the context that the source is patient report, which does not change the underlying product concept or add clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. 349363001 Homeopathic medicine (product) is the precise concept. Parent categories would be too general, and sibling non-homeopathic products would be incorrect. It is distinctly not a therapy or care process, so procedure concepts are excluded."
129293002,Dissection - action (qualifier value),Action recorded: dissection,"This documents dissection as the recorded action within a procedure, aligning with method/action qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The best match is 129293002, reflecting the generic dissection technique. No specific subtype or anatomical detail is stated; thus, parent/sibling/child concepts are not more appropriate, and the disorder concept is excluded."
411579008,Deer epithelium diagnostic allergen extract (product),Deer epithelium diagnostic allergen extract reagent,"Referring to the item as a reagent signals a diagnostic product used in allergy testing, with source deer epithelium, matching SCTID 411579008 in the Product hierarchy. There are no added attributes like dosing or brand. Parent concepts omit the deer detail, and siblings like therapeutic extracts or non-epithelium sources are excluded by the wording."
740439008,Population of all cells positive for CD45 antigen in portion of fluid (body structure),Population of all CD45+ cells within a fluid portion,"This wording explicitly captures the entire population of CD45 antigen–positive cells and locates it within a portion of fluid, matching the anatomical context of the concept. It denotes a body structure (cell population) rather than an observable measurement. SCTID 740439008 is exact because it specifies CD45 positivity and the fluid context. A parent concept omitting the fluid location would be too general, and siblings/children tied to specific types of fluid would be too specific. “CD45+” is a clinically equivalent shorthand indicating antigen positivity without changing meaning or adding attributes."
305788003,Seen by pharmacist (finding),Has been seen by pharmacist,"The phrase expresses the completed finding that the patient has been seen by a pharmacist, without any other qualifiers. It belongs to the Clinical finding category and corresponds to SCTID 305788003 (Seen by pharmacist). Parents are too general and siblings referencing other providers are incorrect. The present perfect tense does not add timing detail beyond the concept itself. No additional attributes such as location, intervention, or consultation are implied."
214227009,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving pedestrian hit by motor vehicle, pedestrian injured (event)",ED triage: pedestrian injured after being struck by a motor vehicle in traffic.,"The content specifies the emergency department context but the core event is a pedestrian injured after being struck by a motor vehicle in a traffic setting, directly matching 214227009. Category: Event. The ED context does not introduce new clinical attributes; it provides documentation setting only. Parents that omit the pedestrian or injury, and siblings such as non-traffic pedestrian incidents, are less specific than this exact event description."
3729002,Hospital-based outpatient pediatric clinic (environment),Paediatric outpatient clinic (hospital-based),"The phrase explicitly specifies a pediatric outpatient clinic and clarifies it is hospital-based. Main concept: environment with hospital-based, outpatient, pediatric, clinic. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It is an exact fit for SCTID 3729002. Without the hospital-based qualifier, it could map to a different sibling concept; without pediatric, it would be a broader parent. No subspecialty or urgency is introduced, maintaining alignment with the intended concept. UK spelling 'paediatric' is clinically equivalent."
337537001,Carbon dioxide gas cylinder C (physical object),"CO2 cylinder, C size","This phrase identifies a cylinder containing CO2 and specifies C size, representing a Physical object. It aligns with SCTID 337537001. 'CO2' is a synonym for carbon dioxide. The explicit size makes it more accurate than the non-size-specific parent and distinguishes it from sibling concepts for other sizes or gases."
302724005,Structure of descending genicular artery (body structure),CTA annotation: descending genicular artery,"The entry labels the descending genicular artery on CT angiography, but the concept being coded is the structure itself. SNOMED category is Body structure, with SCTID 302724005 as the precise code. No added attributes (e.g., pathology or laterality) appear, and it does not generalize to 'genicular arteries' or narrow to its branches, so parents or children are less appropriate."
764882004,Product containing quinolizine (product),Medication order references a product containing quinolizine,"This indicates an order referring to a product that contains quinolizine. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The concept to code is the product containing quinolizine, which corresponds to SCTID 764882004. The order context does not introduce dose, route, strength, or formulation, nor does it require choosing a procedure code here; it merely points to the product. Parent substance codes and child product codes with added specificity are not justified by the wording."
387834003,Exploration of scrotum (procedure),Operative scrotal exploration,"The entry conveys an operation involving scrotal exploration, clearly a Procedure and congruent with Exploration of scrotum, SCTID 387834003. It adds no extra attributes such as timing, laterality, or reasons for the procedure. It is not an exam or imaging study, nor is it a different intervention like scrotal incision or testicular detorsion, so sibling/child codes are less appropriate. 'Operative' is contextual and does not alter the concept."
55180007,Potassium diet (finding),Potassium dietary pattern,"This wording expresses a dietary pattern defined by potassium without stating restriction or elevation, preserving the neutral characterization. The main concept is a potassium-focused diet, categorized as a Clinical finding. The most precise SNOMED mapping is Potassium diet (finding), SCTID 55180007. A generic diet finding would be nonspecific, and children or siblings like low/high potassium diets or other nutrient diets add attributes not present. It is not framed as a therapeutic regimen."
768614002,Product containing phenothiazine and/or phenothiazine derivative (product),MAR notation: phenothiazine or phenothiazine-derivative containing product,"Even in the MAR context, the core concept captured is a product containing phenothiazine or a phenothiazine derivative, aligning with SCTID 768614002. The main concept is the product; attributes are limited to ingredient class inclusion without dose, route, brand, indication, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This inclusive phrasing prevents assignment to child concepts limited to phenothiazine alone or derivatives alone or to specific agents. A broader parent concept would be less specific, making the given concept the appropriate selection."
430268003,Specimen from bone (specimen),Bone specimen submitted,"This reflects a workflow note that a specimen originating from bone has been submitted, with no added attributes regarding method or site. It matches SNOMED CT's Specimen from bone (430268003). The submission status does not change the specimen type. Child concepts requiring biopsy or specific bone sites are not supported by the text, and broader parents would be less precise than explicitly stating bone origin."
73252000,Sebastes phillipsi (organism),Scientific name Sebastes phillipsi,"The term 'Scientific name' indicates the formal binomial Sebastes phillipsi, denoting the exact species taxon. In SNOMED CT, this is an Organism concept and maps specifically to SCTID 73252000. The specification of the scientific name prevents mapping to any parent genus or broader fish category, and it does not point to any sibling species. The phrasing does not introduce extraneous attributes; it only identifies the organism."
263776006,Heavy growth (qualifier value),Culture result: heavy growth,"The statement places the qualifier within a culture result context while specifying only the degree 'heavy.' It is a Qualifier value, best coded as SNOMED CT 263776006 Heavy growth (qualifier value). Parent qualifiers are too general, and siblings (e.g., 'light' or 'moderate' growth) would be incorrect given the explicit heavy descriptor. No organism or specimen is named."
215165000,Pedal cycle accident involving fall from pedal cycle (event),Accident during bicycling resulting in fall from bicycle,"The statement captures an accident that occurred while bicycling and explicitly notes the fall from the bicycle, satisfying the concept definition. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 215165000 is the precise code as it combines accident and fall from pedal cycle. A parent code for 'bicycling accident' is too general, while a sibling 'fall from bicycle' lacks the accident portion. No severity, timing, or cause details are added."
370923007,Serious reportable event associated with criminal activity (event),Serious reportable event linked to criminal activity,"The wording reflects a serious reportable event with a linkage to criminal activity; 'linked to' is synonymous with 'associated with' in this context. This falls under the Event category and matches SCTID 370923007 given the explicit criminal association. The entry does not add details such as outcomes, timing, or type of crime, so child or sibling concepts are not implicated. It also is more precise than the parent 'serious reportable event' by including the required association."
473070008,Family history of mitochondrial disease (situation),Intake note: family history of mitochondrial disease,"The clinical context (intake note) does not alter the concept’s meaning, which remains a family history of mitochondrial disease. It fits the Situation with explicit context category in SNOMED CT. The wording does not introduce details that would require a more specific child concept nor does it generalize to a broader parent concept."
112562002,Notropis rubricroceus (organism),Cataloged as Notropis rubricroceus,"This wording indicates cataloging under the species name Notropis rubricroceus, which corresponds to the SNOMED CT Organism concept. No extra attributes beyond the species identification are introduced. Coding to broader parents or other Notropis species would lose specificity, so 112562002 is the correct, granular mapping."
223646005,Azerbaijan (geographic location),Location name: Azerbaijan,"Azerbaijan is given as a location name, preserving the identification of the country. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographical location). This matches SCTID 223646005 exactly by naming the country-level geographic location. Parent or sibling conceptual categories are not more appropriate because the country is explicitly named. The field-style context does not add timing, causality, or other non-location attributes."
1300163008,Past pregnancy history of multiple induced termination of pregnancy (situation),Charted obstetric history records multiple induced TOP.,"This chart entry for obstetric history records multiple induced TOP (termination of pregnancy), i.e., multiple induced terminations in past pregnancies. SNOMED CT category: Situation. It maps precisely to SCTID 1300163008 because the context is past pregnancy history and multiplicity is explicit. Parent concepts without multiplicity and sibling concepts for single induced termination or spontaneous abortion are not appropriate. “TOP” is an accepted synonym for termination of pregnancy and does not alter the concept."
224667003,Truck converted to mobile home (environment),Home environment: truck converted to mobile home,"This documents the home environment as a truck converted to a mobile home, clearly identifying the environmental concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps to 'Truck converted to mobile home (environment)' (224667003) due to the explicit mention of a truck and conversion to a mobile home. More general parents omit the truck detail, and sibling concepts (e.g., motor home, bus) would misstate the vehicle type. The contextual phrase 'Home environment' does not introduce attributes beyond environment."
223617003,Syrian Arab Republic (geographic location),Location: Syria,"This entry references 'Syria' as the location, with 'Syria' being synonymous with 'Syrian Arab Republic.' It is a pure geographic reference and fits SNOMED CT’s Location (Geographic location) category, mapping to SCTID 223617003. There is no added attribute suggesting an alternative or broader concept, so parent or sibling codes are inappropriate."
1137685003,Normal tissue perfusion (finding),Normal tissue perfusion documented,"The entry records documentation of normal tissue perfusion, maintaining focus on the finding itself and avoiding added qualifiers. It maps to the Clinical finding Normal tissue perfusion. A more general parent would not capture the normal state, and organ-specific children are not indicated by the text. The documentation phrasing is equivalent to asserting the normal perfusion finding."
258474009,Sinus fluid specimen (specimen),Sinus fluid specimen in process,"This laboratory workflow note indicates a specimen composed of sinus fluid is being processed, with no method or specific sinus details. The correct SNOMED CT Specimen concept is Sinus fluid specimen (258474009). Processing status is contextual and does not affect the underlying specimen type. Broader parents or more granular child/sibling concepts introducing attributes are not appropriate here."
716018007,Dasabuvir sodium (substance),Dasabuvir as sodium salt,"This phrasing denotes the sodium salt form of dasabuvir, which is dasabuvir sodium, aligning to SNOMED CT Substance 716018007. It does not add product, dose, or therapeutic context, keeping the focus on the substance. Generic dasabuvir (parent) would be less specific, and medicinal product siblings would be incorrect due to the absence of formulation details."
76679000,Vibratory fluttering (observable entity),Vibratory fluttering,"The entry exactly matches the SNOMED CT preferred term “Vibratory fluttering,” identifying a qualitative observable phenomenon characterized by a fluttering quality within a vibration. No attributes such as site, cause, severity, or timing are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This is the most precise match because it denotes the specific vibratory pattern, whereas parent concepts like generic “Vibration” would be broader and sibling or child concepts such as cardiac “flutter” or clinical findings like “palpitations” introduce anatomical or symptomatic context not present here."
718003003,Cone beam computed tomography of pelvis (procedure),Cone beam CT pelvis,"The entry states a cone-beam computed tomography of the pelvis, specifying both the modality (CBCT) and the anatomic site (pelvis). This is a Procedure in SNOMED CT. The most precise match is 'Cone beam computed tomography of pelvis' because it captures the exact imaging technique and region. More general parents like 'Cone beam CT of region of body' lack the pelvic site, and siblings such as 'CT of pelvis' do not specify the cone-beam modality. Other pelvic imaging (e.g., MRI pelvis or pelvic radiograph) would be incorrect. Using 'CT' together with 'cone beam' is a standard clinical synonym for CBCT and does not change the code selection."
67236001,Hospital-based outpatient physical medicine clinic (environment),Site of care: hospital-based outpatient physiatry clinic,"Site of care is specified as a hospital-based outpatient clinic in physiatry, a synonym for physical medicine. This remains an Environment concept, with all key attributes present. SCTID 67236001 is the correct code. Parent concepts that omit specialty or hospital/outpatient context are too general, and sibling concepts like rehabilitation or physiotherapy clinics would be inaccurate because they reflect different service environments, not the physical medicine physician clinic."
309993003,Surgical transplant department (environment),Practice location: transplant surgery department,‘Practice location’ here denotes the environment of the transplant surgery department. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It precisely corresponds to SCTID 309993003 and is not more general or more specific than intended. Sibling concepts like transplant clinics or units are excluded by the explicit ‘department’ wording. No additional attributes are introduced.
328662000,Gluten-free biscuits (product),Patient preference: gluten-free biscuits,"This records a patient preference for gluten-free biscuits, identifying the product without adding qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Product (food product). Preference context does not alter the product’s coded identity. A parent like 'Biscuits' is insufficiently specific, while siblings or broader gluten-free foods differ in type or scope. The exact match remains 'Gluten-free biscuits (product)'."
293952002,Allergy to selegiline (finding),Allergy: selegiline,"This concise notation identifies selegiline as the allergen in the allergy list, with no added reaction details. The concept is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 293952002 provides the exact drug-specific allergy. A parent like Drug allergy lacks the specificity, and a sibling such as Allergy to a different MAO inhibitor would not match the named drug. The format is a standard clinical shorthand that is semantically equivalent."
309048008,Endocrine specimen (specimen),Specimen of endocrine origin,"The entry characterizes the specimen by its origin in the endocrine system, with no mention of a specific gland or procedural detail. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Code 309048008 Endocrine specimen (specimen) is the exact match since it encodes specimens from endocrine sources. A parent code would omit the origin detail, and any child concept would require a specified organ like adrenal or thyroid, which is not present here. The phrase uses a synonymic description of origin and remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
223760001,Sarawak (geographic location),State of Sarawak,"This wording uses a common synonym indicating Sarawak's administrative level as a state, which is clinically equivalent to naming the geographic location Sarawak. The concept type is Location. The exact SNOMED CT match is Sarawak (geographic location) SCTID 223760001. It does not refer to Malaysia as a whole (parent) nor to subdivisions within Sarawak (child), so the selected concept is the most precise representation."
35891000087104,Monascus purpureus (organism),"Monascus purpureus, species designation","This entry assigns the species designation Monascus purpureus, focusing solely on the organism name. The concept falls under the SNOMED CT Organism category. There are no clinical or specimen-related attributes provided, so Monascus purpureus (organism) is the exact code. Broader parents such as Monascus (organism) at the genus level or Fungi are less precise, and no strain details are present to warrant a child concept. Sibling species are not indicated."
1373384003,American Joint Committee on Cancer aTis(Paget) (qualifier value),Final staging descriptor per AJCC: aTis (Paget),"It identifies the final AJCC staging descriptor specifically as aTis (Paget), highlighting the autopsy prefix 'a'. Main concept: AJCC T-category qualifier. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. This is the exact qualifier and does not imply other prefixes or disorder-level concepts. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., Tis [Paget] without 'a', or Tis [ductal]) are less specific than the text provided."
727288000,Entire submucosa of urinary bladder (body structure),Anatomic site: entire urinary bladder submucosa,"This entry sets the anatomical site as the entire submucosa of the urinary bladder, matching SCTID 727288000 in the Body structure category. The context label “Anatomic site” does not add new clinical attributes; it simply frames the structure. It excludes parents without the entire qualifier and avoids sibling layers like mucosa or muscularis, ensuring precise mapping."
467022000,X-ray film processor tester (physical object),X-ray processor tester for film,"The phrase indicates a device that tests an X-ray processor specifically for film, precisely reflecting the intended Physical object (Device). The added words “for film” clarify the processor type without introducing a separate attribute or altering scope. This is not the processor itself, nor a general X-ray equipment tester, making parent concepts too broad and sibling concepts such as sensitometers or densitometers inaccurate. The device’s role—testing—matches the semantic intent of an X-ray film processor tester. The wording remains unambiguous and does not imply any other object or process, supporting selection of the precise concept code."
215547007,"Hit by falling object due to accident to watercraft, docker or stevedore injured (event)",Dockhand struck by falling object in the context of a boat accident,"The phrase conveys that a dockhand (docker/stevedore) was struck by a falling object and frames the event within a boat accident, satisfying the watercraft accident attribute. The main concept is a specified external cause event. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 215547007 is the most precise match because it pairs the mechanism with the accident type and occupation. Parents lacking these combined attributes or siblings for other injured populations are less appropriate. 'Dockhand' is a valid synonym for docker/stevedore, maintaining coding integrity."
1366564007,Iris configuration of right eye (observable entity),Follow-up checklist item: right iris configuration,The text indicates a checklist item referring to the observable property 'iris configuration' for the right eye. 'Follow-up' is contextual and does not alter the observable. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This is best coded as Iris configuration of right eye (1366564007); it is not the laterality-unspecified parent and does not represent a finding or disorder because no value is present.
228431008,Does not follow drug-related rituals (situation),Drug-use rituals not followed.,"Using 'drug-use rituals' as a synonym for 'drug-related rituals,' the entry asserts non-following. It remains focused on the behavioral status with no additional qualifiers. The correct category is Situation, with SCTID 228431008. Sibling or parent concepts such as following rituals or general drug-use behavior are less precise. 'Drug-use rituals' is clinically equivalent wording and does not alter the code."
1306904005,Home-made vegetable soup (substance),Food substance—home-made vegetable soup,"The dash-separated context label does not change the core concept: the substance is 'home-made vegetable soup.' Category: Substance. SNOMED CT 1306904005 is the precise code as it encodes vegetable soup with the home-made qualifier. Generic 'vegetable soup' lacks this qualifier, and other soup concepts would misrepresent the item. No additional attributes such as nutritional profile or portion are stated."
122658000,Specimen from ampulla of Vater obtained by ampullectomy (specimen),Ampullectomy specimen from ampulla of Vater,"The entry centers on a specimen and specifies that it is from the ampulla of Vater, obtained via ampullectomy. No additional clinical details are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122658000 is appropriate because it represents a specimen from the ampulla of Vater with the ampullectomy method; choosing a parent concept omitting the method or a sibling such as papillectomy/biopsy would misrepresent the acquisition. The wording is a straightforward paraphrase that preserves the exact site and method."
442681007,Recipient consented (qualifier value),Recipient's consent provided.,"This entry denotes that the consent originating from the recipient has been given, maintaining focus on the actor and status only. It is a Qualifier value representing recipient consent status. Recipient consented (442681007) is the correct code. The phrasing is a safe synonym of 'recipient consented' and does not drift toward documentation type, timing, or other actors, thereby avoiding parent or sibling concepts."
434902002,Planctomyces maris (organism),P. maris (Planctomyces maris),"This uses a standard abbreviation 'P. maris' immediately expanded to the full species name 'Planctomyces maris,' removing ambiguity and firmly identifying the species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the precise code is 434902002. The entry introduces no attributes like site or pathogenicity. Parent concepts (genus) would be broader, and siblings (other Planctomyces species) would be incorrect. The abbreviation is a clinically safe synonym when expanded as shown."
736311000,Structure of soft tissue of right knee region (body structure),Soft tissue of right knee region (anatomical structure),"Adding 'anatomical structure' clarifies the category without altering meaning. The entry specifies soft tissue, knee region, and laterality right. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This maps exactly to SCTID 736311000, denoting the anatomical soft tissues of the right knee region. Parent concepts that include bone or omit laterality are too broad, while child concepts would be overly specific to particular tissues; neither aligns with this generalized regional soft tissue statement."
360329004,Polyethylene terephthalate graft (physical object),Device type recorded: polyethylene terephthalate graft,"The recorded device type is a graft composed of polyethylene terephthalate, precisely matching the concept. Category: Physical object. No anatomical site, usage timing, or manufacturing form is introduced, so SCTID 360329004 is the exact code. Broader device or graft concepts lack the material detail, and different-material or composite-device siblings are excluded by the PET specification."
478006,Non-occupational (qualifier value),Unrelated to occupation,"This phrase semantically matches 'non-occupational', stating that there is no connection to occupation. It represents a Qualifier value and maps to SNOMED CT 478006. The entry does not introduce cause, severity, timing, or other attributes. A parent generic qualifier would lack specificity, and siblings like 'occupational' would contradict the content. There is no implication of a specific subtype; therefore the non-occupational qualifier is the appropriate code."
714071005,Donor cornea container (physical object),Donor cornea transport container,"The wording specifies a container intended for transporting donor cornea. It is still the same Physical object, and the transport function does not introduce a different concept; it clarifies typical use. This maps to SCTID 714071005, as it remains the cornea-specific container. Broader transport containers lacking corneal specificity or sibling containers for other tissues are inappropriate. No medium, temperature, or procedural attributes are implied."
128170008,Tissue specimen from prostate (specimen),Tissue sample from the prostate,"This narrative phrase still conveys the core elements: a specimen composed of tissue with origin in the prostate. It aligns with the Specimen concept 128170008. It avoids additional attributes such as technique or processing, so it is not a biopsy specimen nor a whole-organ specimen, and it is more precise than non-tissue prostate specimen concepts."
411639008,Bovine lactoferrin diagnostic allergen extract (product),Inventory item: bovine lactoferrin diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry frames the concept within inventory but specifically identifies the product as the bovine lactoferrin diagnostic allergen extract, avoiding any added attributes such as strength or manufacturer. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 411639008 is appropriate because it precisely denotes the bovine lactoferrin diagnostic extract. A generic diagnostic allergen product would be too broad, and sibling concepts for different bovine milk proteins would not match the lactoferrin specification."
168534004,Radiotherapy completed (situation),Radiotherapy now complete,"The wording indicates the current status is 'complete' for radiotherapy, without adding timing details beyond the completion state. Main concept: completion of radiotherapy. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 168534004 matches the status context precisely. A procedure code for radiotherapy would not capture the completed state, and siblings like 'in progress' or 'started' are incompatible. 'Complete' is equivalent to 'completed' and does not introduce additional attributes."
1187373000,Structure of twelfth costochondral junction (body structure),Costochondral junction of the twelfth rib,"This phrasing explicitly ties the junction to the twelfth rib, without adding any extra attributes. The main concept is the anatomical junction associated with rib 12. Category: Body structure. It aligns with SCTID 1187373000 because it designates the twelfth costochondral junction. A parent like “costochondral junction of rib” (unspecified) would be insufficiently specific, and siblings referring to other rib numbers would not match. The phrase is a direct synonym that preserves the same anatomical scope."
730523001,Entire seventh posterior intercostal artery (body structure),"Intercostal artery—posterior, seventh","This variant clarifies the artery type (intercostal, posterior) and the ordinal (seventh), describing the same anatomical vessel. Category: Body structure. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Entire seventh posterior intercostal artery (730523001). A more general intercostal artery concept would be too broad, and any branch-specific concept would be too narrow. The em-dash and ordering are stylistic and do not alter meaning."
440959009,Sulfitobacter brevis (organism),Database organism entry: Sulfitobacter brevis,"The entry indicates a database record naming the organism Sulfitobacter brevis, which is a taxonomic reference. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 440959009 exactly corresponds to this species. No clinical qualifiers (detection, site, infection, or timing) are included, so a finding or disorder code would be inappropriate. Parent or sibling organism concepts would be less specific than the species-level code used here."
223649003,Cyprus (geographic location),Cyprus (geographic location),"This phrasing explicitly identifies Cyprus as a geographic location, aligning exactly with the SNOMED CT concept Cyprus (geographic location), SCTID 223649003. The category is Qualifier value—Geographic location. Parent concepts like Geographic location are too broad, while child concepts such as specific municipalities in Cyprus are not indicated. Sibling geographic locations are not referenced. The parenthetical clarifier does not alter meaning or introduce attributes; it simply affirms the semantic type of the term and retains precise mapping."
59324002,Quercus velutina (organism),Quercus velutina tree,"Describing the organism as a 'tree' is consistent with the natural form of Quercus velutina and still denotes the species-level organism concept (SCTID 59324002) without adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It remains a reference to the specific species and does not broaden to a generic 'oak tree' parent or shift to material/part concepts (e.g., wood or pollen). No sibling species are implied, so the species code is appropriate."
411766002,Prunus domestica diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic use only—Prunus domestica allergen extract,"The entry emphasizes diagnostic use and names Prunus domestica as the allergen source, which aligns exactly with the diagnostic allergen extract product concept 411766002. The category is Product. Stating ""diagnostic use only"" helps distinguish it from therapeutic extracts. No additional formulation or strength details are present, avoiding child concept mapping, and specifying the species prevents mapping to a broader parent or to a sibling allergen from another Prunus species."
236081008,Congenital fecal incontinence (finding),Discharge diagnosis: congenital fecal incontinence,"Discharge summary diagnosis states fecal incontinence with congenital onset. Category: Clinical finding. This exactly aligns to SNOMED CT 236081008. Without the congenital attribute, the parent concept would be less specific; no subtypes or etiologies are mentioned that would misdirect coding."
9026007,Genus Leucaena (organism),Genus Leucaena,"The entry explicitly names the taxonomic genus Leucaena, which is an organism-level classification. No species, family, exposure, or other attributes are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this fits the Organism category, and the most precise match is SCTID 9026007 (Genus Leucaena). More general parent concepts like generic 'Genus (organism)' or plant genera would be too broad, and child concepts representing specific Leucaena species would add detail not stated. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
52841000087104,Patient lifting system walking sling (physical object),Device present: walking sling (patient lifting system),"This inventory-style statement names the device as a walking sling and specifies its association with a patient lifting system, with no extra qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The exact object is the walking sling used with lifts, so SCTID 52841000087104 is appropriate. Parent concepts (generic sling for lifts) and sibling sling types (e.g., transfer or toileting) do not reflect the walking purpose."
223511009,Egypt (geographic location),Location value: Egypt,"The text presents Egypt as a location value without specifying a relationship like residence or travel. The best match is Egypt (geographic location) SCTID 223511009, under Geographic location. Broader parents would reduce specificity, while children or siblings such as city names or neighboring nations would be incorrect. The framing as a ‘value’ does not introduce new attributes; it simply indicates that the location concept selected is Egypt."
369116002,Entire crus of fornix (body structure),Fornical crus—entire,"This entry uses the clinically accepted synonym 'fornical crus' for crus of fornix and specifies 'entire', ensuring the whole structure is referenced. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It matches SCTID 369116002 exactly, whereas a parent concept like 'Structure of crus of fornix' without the 'entire' qualifier would be less precise, and sibling parts (e.g., fornix commissure) are not suggested."
160318000,Family history: Hereditary spherocytosis (situation),FHx – hereditary spherocytosis,"This entry records family history (FHx) of hereditary spherocytosis, which is a situation context rather than the patient’s active disorder. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and SCTID 160318000 is the most precise match. It does not introduce relative specificity, severity, or timing, so more general parents (family history of disease) or more specific children (family history in a particular relative) do not fit better, and the disorder code for hereditary spherocytosis is inappropriate because the entry is about family history."
247373008,Ankle pain (finding),Indication: ankle pain,"This phrasing is commonly used on test orders or reports to state the clinical indication as pain at the ankle. It adds only context of use and no clinical qualifiers like laterality or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The most precise match is Ankle pain (finding), SCTID 247373008. Parent concepts such as limb pain are too general, while child/sibling terms that specify side, chronicity, or alternate sites would be mismatched."
411147007,Extended series patch test product (product),Supplementary series patch test product,"The concept is a patch test product described as a supplementary (extended) series. Category: Product. “Supplementary series” is a clinically safe synonym for extended series, conveying the broader set without altering product type or introducing composition or procedural details. It avoids mapping to baseline/standard series and fits SCTID 411147007."
223709002,Saint Lucia (geographic location),Location: Saint Lucia,"This generic documentation label presents Saint Lucia as the location. The core concept is the geographic place; no other attributes (e.g., time, severity, clinical context) are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The precise match is 223709002. Parent concepts are too broad, and no reference is made to a child entity (towns/regions) or to other countries (siblings)."
134651000119108,History of estrogen therapy (situation),Documented prior estrogen treatment,"This entry conveys that earlier estrogen-based treatment is documented, emphasizing history without adding details concerning indication, dose, route, duration, or exact timing. The main concept is prior estrogen therapy. It aligns with the SNOMED CT category Situation with explicit context. The most specific match is History of estrogen therapy (situation). Using a broader parent such as History of drug therapy would be less precise, and siblings focusing on other hormones or active therapy would be incorrect. 'Treatment' is a synonym for 'therapy' and maintains the same code."
782567006,Structure of soft tissue of forearm (body structure),Soft tissues of forearm,"The entry names the forearm soft tissues collectively and remains an anatomic structure reference. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It does not add laterality, timing, severity, or associated conditions and does not specify particular tissue types, thereby avoiding child concepts. It is not as broad as 'forearm structure,' making SCTID 782567006 the most precise match over parents or siblings such as muscle of forearm or skin of forearm."
223611002,Kuwait (geographic location),Kuwait – nation,"‘Nation’ is a clinically acceptable synonym for ‘country’ without adding attributes. The entry denotes the geographic entity of Kuwait, mapping precisely to Kuwait (geographic location), SCTID 223611002, in the Location (Qualifier value) domain. It does not imply city-level detail or person-related attributes like ethnicity or citizenship, so more general parents or unrelated siblings are less suitable."
226845004,Wensleydale cheese (substance),Food diary entry: Wensleydale cheese,"The entry highlights Wensleydale cheese in a food diary context without stating consumption amounts, timing, or reactions, keeping the focus on the substance itself. This aligns with SNOMED CT Wensleydale cheese (substance), SCTID 226845004 within the Substance hierarchy. The diary context does not require coding to a behavior or event; it is simply naming the substance. Parent concepts like Cheese (substance) are too general, while sibling cheeses represent different items. The term remains a precise match."
119365002,Specimen from wound (specimen),Wound sample collected,"This indicates a sample (specimen) was collected and that its source was a wound, with no further specifics. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to Specimen from wound (specimen) SCTID 119365002, since neither specimen type nor wound subtype is given. Coding to a parent like Specimen would be too nonspecific, and coding to child concepts like Wound swab specimen would be inappropriate because the collection method is not specified."
242910000,Assault with hammer (event),Event: assault with hammer,"Main concept: explicit documentation of the event of assault with a hammer. Attributes: method/means = hammer; event framing = explicit. SNOMED CT category: Event. This corresponds exactly to 242910000 Assault with hammer (event). A generic parent Assault (event) would be less precise because it lacks the weapon specification. Sibling concepts for other weapons are incorrect given the hammer stated. The entry does not add attributes like timing, location, injury, or perpetrator; it simply identifies the event. Framing it as “Event:” is a contextual label and does not change the underlying clinical concept, so the hammer-specific assault code remains the best match."
464093005,Radionuclide neutron activation system collimator (physical object),Radionuclide neutron activation instrumentation collimator,This indicates the collimator component within the instrumentation of a radionuclide neutron activation setup. The main concept remains the device object (collimator) associated with that specific system. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It appropriately maps to SCTID 464093005. Using “instrumentation” does not change the device type; it clarifies the equipment context without broadening to unrelated collimators (siblings). No additional attributes are present.
470246003,Analgesic brain electrical stimulation system (physical object),Brain pain management electrical stimulation system,"This phrase denotes a physical system for electrical stimulation of the brain used for pain management, synonymous with analgesia. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. 'Pain management' in device purpose is clinically equivalent here and maintains the brain and electrical modality. Broader or different-anatomy systems (spinal/peripheral) would be mismatched, and technique-specific devices (e.g., implanted DBS) would be overly specific. SCTID 470246003 is the most accurate mapping."
838282007,Tin oxide dust (substance),Tin oxide dust described,"The entry describes the material and names it as tin oxide dust, a Substance concept. It corresponds to SCTID 838282007 because it captures the dust form of tin oxide. No mention of exposure, location, or clinical effects is present, so findings or events are excluded. It is more precise than broader tin oxide concepts and does not drift into other physical forms like powders or fumes."
15457008,Closure of cecosigmoidal fistula (procedure),Closure of fistulous tract connecting cecum and sigmoid,"The entry identifies closure of the fistulous tract specifically between the cecum and sigmoid, aligning with cecosigmoidal fistula closure. Category: Procedure. This maps directly to SCTID 15457008; parents like closure of gastrointestinal fistula are too general, and siblings for different fistula locations would not match. The term ""fistulous tract"" is a standard synonym for fistula and does not alter the procedure concept."
397235005,Specimen from renal pelvis obtained by complete nephroureterectomy (specimen),Patient report: tissue from the kidney’s pelvis taken during complete nephroureterectomy,"In patient-friendly phrasing, the specimen is tissue from the kidney’s pelvis (renal pelvis) taken during complete nephroureterectomy. The main concept remains a Specimen with attributes of site and acquisition method, matching the SNOMED CT concept SCTID 397235005. Parent concepts that omit the procedure or sibling concepts involving partial surgery or biopsy would not reflect the described context. The synonym “kidney’s pelvis” is equivalent to “renal pelvis,” and the entry adds no extraneous attributes that would shift coding."
972643561000119100,History of fracture of occipital bone (situation),Follow-up note: history of occipital bone fracture,"This clinical note context explicitly references a history of occipital bone fracture during follow-up. The main concept remains a past occipital bone fracture with explicit historical context. It should be coded as a Situation with explicit context, using SCTID 972643561000119100. A disorder code for active fracture would be incorrect, and broader or narrower historical fracture concepts would misalign with the specified anatomy. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term in meaning and coding."
256514008,Acrylic dental material - microwave cured (substance),Acrylic dental polymer (microwave-cured),"Identifies an acrylic polymer used in dentistry and states it is microwave-cured, maintaining focus on the substance and its curing method. Category: Substance. 'Polymer' is an acceptable synonym for resin/material in this context, and the microwave attribute ensures precise alignment to the microwave-cured acrylic dental material concept rather than a generic or differently cured variant."
392359008,Fagus grandifolia specific immunoglobulin E antibody measurement (procedure),Measurement of specific IgE to Fagus grandifolia,This entry states a measurement of allergen-specific IgE antibodies to Fagus grandifolia. The main concept is the lab procedure measuring sIgE for American beech. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 392359008 is the precise match because it names the exact allergen species; parent concepts that omit species or sibling concepts for other allergens would be less precise. The wording aligns with the concept label and avoids additional attributes such as results or method.
263788008,Intumescent (qualifier value),Descriptor noted: intumescent,"This documentation indicates that the descriptor applied is “intumescent,” which functions purely as a qualitative modifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, matching Intumescent (qualifier value) [263788008]. No anatomical site or clinical assertion is present, so parent clinical finding concepts are excluded, and child or sibling qualifiers (e.g., other swelling-related adjectives) are not implied. The term remains an attribute and thus maps best to the qualifier value."
307039009,Entire compartment of thigh (body structure),Documentation indicates complete thigh compartment,"The entry conveys that the anatomical reference is the complete thigh compartment, a synonym for 'entire.' There are no added attributes like laterality or particular compartment orientation. It is a Body structure concept and matches 'Entire compartment of thigh' (SCTID 307039009). A parent concept would be less precise, and child compartments are not specified, supporting this exact code."
463037002,"Ligation clip, metallic (physical object)",Metallic ligation clip,"The entry explicitly names a ligation clip and specifies it is metallic, identifying a device used to ligate without adding any location, procedure, or status attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This maps most precisely to SCTID 463037002 (Ligation clip, metallic) because the material property (metallic) is included. The generic parent concept “Ligation clip (physical object)” would be less specific because it omits the material, and children specifying a particular metal (e.g., titanium) are not indicated. Sibling concepts like nonmetallic ligation clips or other surgical clips (e.g., aneurysm clips) are excluded by the explicit term “ligation clip” and the metallic material."
465860007,Tracheal bistoury (physical object),Catalog entry: tracheal bistoury,"This specifies a catalog listing for a tracheal bistoury, which directly names the instrument. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The precise code is Tracheal bistoury (physical object) SCTID 465860007. Parent categories like generic bistoury or surgical knife are overly broad, and sibling items such as tracheotomes or dilators would represent different devices. The catalog context is neutral and does not modify the object."
227522007,Cheese sauce (substance),Cheese sauce on tray,"While specifying context (on tray), the entry still names the substance ""cheese sauce."" The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Cheese sauce (substance) [227522007] is the exact match. The tray context does not convert this into an encounter, event, or product packaging concept; it remains a mention of the substance. Parents such as Sauce (substance) and siblings like tomato sauce are less precise for the stated term."
299487003,Active range of midtarsal pronation (observable entity),Follow-up: reviewed active midtarsal pronation ROM,"This entry reflects reviewing the observable measurement of active midtarsal pronation range of motion, which is SCTID 299487003. The follow-up context does not change the observable entity; it merely indicates timing of review without adding attributes like magnitude or normality. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts involving passive motion or other joints (e.g., subtalar) would not be appropriate given the specifics stated."
1344892002,Repair of artery with synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene patch graft (procedure),Surgeon placed a PTFE patch graft to repair the artery,"This narrative describes the placement of a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) patch graft to repair an artery, clearly indicating arterial repair with a PTFE patch. The main concept is an arterial repair employing a synthetic PTFE patch graft. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps directly to SCTID 1344892002; broader parent concepts or siblings with different materials/techniques are excluded by the specific PTFE patch graft detail."
223897000,Shropshire (geographic location),Address county—Shropshire,"This indicates that the address’s county field is Shropshire, which still isolates the geographic location as the concept. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223897000 accurately represents Shropshire. The context of an address does not change the entity or imply a different administrative area. Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise. No clinical qualifiers are introduced; it’s purely a place designation."
467168004,Blood-processing autotransfusion system (physical object),Cell saver device,"This entry uses the conventional term 'cell saver' with 'device,' identifying a physical object designed for cell salvage autotransfusion (i.e., blood processing before autologous reinfusion). SNOMED category: Physical object (device). It corresponds to SCTID 467168004, as 'cell saver' implies processing rather than simple drainage/reservoir autotransfusion. The synonym remains clinically equivalent and does not add extraneous attributes."
414352006,Gluten-free and wheat-free bread and cake mix (product),Stocked: gluten-free and wheat-free bread-and-cake mix,"The entry indicates a stocked product described as a bread-and-cake mix that is gluten-free and wheat-free. SNOMED CT category: Product. The hyphenated phrasing is a stylistic synonym and does not change meaning. It maps exactly to SCTID 414352006, which is more precise than general baking mixes or mixes limited to bread or cake only."
13363002,Structure of posterior tibial artery (body structure),Anatomy of the posterior tibial artery,"This entry states the anatomy pertains to the posterior tibial artery, specifying the anatomical vessel in the Body structure category. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is Structure of posterior tibial artery (SCTID 13363002). The phrase does not introduce laterality, pathology, or procedural context that would necessitate a different code. Parent concepts are broader, and sibling vessels are not mentioned, so the selected concept remains the most specific match."
708175003,Diagnostic imaging service (qualifier value),Diagnostic imaging service identified,"The concept captured is identification of a diagnostic imaging service, matching SNOMED CT 708175003 (Qualifier value). Contextual wording (‘identified’) does not modify the service type, and the absence of modality, site, or technique keeps it general but specific to diagnostic imaging. Parent concepts that are generic services are too broad, while children such as radiology or ultrasound services are too narrow. No sibling non-diagnostic service intent is implied."
1041000119100,Partner relationship problem (finding),Psychosocial assessment: partner relationship problem,"This statement identifies a partner relationship problem within a psychosocial assessment context, which does not alter the underlying finding or add attributes like cause or severity. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. Partner relationship problem (finding), SCTID 1041000119100, fits exactly. Broader interpersonal problem codes are less specific, and siblings such as marital problems or family relationship problems do not match the partner-specific focus; no violence is indicated."
20330006,Diverticulopexy of hypopharynx (procedure),Pexy of hypopharyngeal diverticulum,The phrase denotes a surgical fixation (pexy) of a diverticulum arising from the hypopharynx. Attributes stated: action = pexy; site = hypopharyngeal diverticulum. Category: Procedure. SNOMED CT 20330006 precisely represents this intervention. Parent concepts like hypopharyngeal surgery or diverticulum surgery do not specify pexy and site together. Siblings such as diverticulectomy or repair change the surgical intent from fixation to excision or reconstruction. 'Pexy' is a direct synonym for fixation/suspension and does not alter code selection.
733485008,Specimen from lesion of perianal region obtained by scraping (specimen),Specimen from lesion of perianal region obtained by scraping,"This is the preferred term wording and exactly states a specimen taken by scraping from a lesion located in the perianal region. Attributes: specimen entity, source lesion, site perianal region, method scraping. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and SCTID 733485008 is the precise code. Any parent omitting the method or the lesion qualifier would be less specific, and siblings like swab or biopsy specimens would be incorrect given the explicit scraping method."
710907000,Goldenrod pollen (substance),Plant pollen—goldenrod,"This concise documentation entry identifies the plant-derived pollen from goldenrod, equivalent to goldenrod pollen. Category: Substance. It fits exactly to SNOMED 710907000, avoiding mapping to broader ‘plant pollen’ or different plant pollen siblings. The dash-separated form is stylistic and does not introduce attributes like results or allergy status."
463899001,Medical gas pipeline system (physical object),Medical gas pipeline distribution system,"Adding ‘distribution’ remains within the meaning of the pipeline system that distributes medical gases; it does not introduce new attributes beyond the inherent function of a pipeline system. This is still a Physical object and fits SCTID 463899001. It avoids narrower components (outlets, regulators) and avoids unrelated siblings (cylinders). Parent concepts lacking the medical gas qualifier are not precise enough, so the medical gas pipeline system code is preferred."
242921009,Assault by branding (event),Assault involving branding,"This phrasing identifies an assault with the specific involvement of branding, preserving the core concept of assault by branding without adding extraneous attributes. The category is Event, describing a specific harmful occurrence. It is equivalent to the preferred term because the wording “involving branding” conveys the same mechanism of assault. A broader parent like “Assault (event)” would omit the branding detail, and a sibling such as “Assault by burning” is less precise than branding, so SCTID 242921009 is the correct match."
303949008,Structure of lumbar spinal cerebrospinal fluid pathway (body structure),Area of interest: lumbar spinal cerebrospinal fluid pathway,"This is a context phrase marking the area of interest as the CSF pathway within the lumbar spine. Attributes are region (lumbar spine) and entity (CSF pathway). Category: Body structure. It aligns with SCTID 303949008. Broader parents like “cerebrospinal fluid pathway” or “spinal CSF pathway” lack the lumbar focus, while siblings (e.g., “lumbar spinal canal,” “lumbar subarachnoid space”) are different anatomical entities. The wording stays strictly anatomical without adding disease, function, or procedure."
295113007,Allergy to deoxyribonuclease (finding),Known allergy to deoxyribonuclease,"This wording conveys that the patient is known to have an allergy to deoxyribonuclease, without details of severity, reaction, or product type. It is a Clinical finding corresponding to SNOMED CT 295113007. Parent categories like 'Drug allergy' would be overly broad and fail to name the allergen; child concepts referencing specific recombinant DNase medications would be narrower than stated. The phrase 'known' does not add attributes that change coding; it confirms the same finding."
309925001,Endocrinology department (environment),Primary department: Endocrinology department,"This entry designates the primary organizational department as Endocrinology, which is an environment. The category is Environment. The term 'department' ensures precise mapping to Endocrinology department (environment) rather than to clinic or ward siblings. Parent categories would be too general and omit the specialty. The modifier 'primary' is contextual and does not change the coded entity from being the endocrinology department."
63674003,"Recurrent inhibitory potential, function (observable entity)",Plan: recurrent inhibitory potential function,"This entry shows care plan context, but the subject remains the observable entity 'recurrent inhibitory potential function.' There is no added attribute about the function itself. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. Given the explicit mention of the function of the recurrent inhibitory potential, SCTID 63674003 is exact. A parent concept would dilute specificity, while child concepts that imply particular measured parameters or interpretations are not implied in this succinct plan notation."
328715003,Gluten-free and wheat-free white flour mix (product),"White baking flour blend (gluten-free, wheat-free)","This entry denotes a white flour blend intended for baking that is explicitly gluten-free and wheat-free, which is a food Product in SNOMED CT. The best fit is 'Gluten-free and wheat-free white flour mix' (SCTID 328715003). 'Blend' is synonymous with 'mix' and does not introduce new attributes. Broader concepts like 'gluten-free product' or 'baking mix' lack either the white flour mix specificity or the dual-free property. More specific alternatives (e.g., self-raising or fortified blends) add attributes not present. Therefore, this wording corresponds uniquely to the stated concept."
223933002,Central region (geographic location),Travel history: central region,"The entry lists 'central region' as the travel location value, keeping the focus on the geographic region. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). This maps best to SCTID 223933002 due to the explicit central cardinal reference. Parent concepts like generic 'Region' are less specific, and sibling cardinal regions are not indicated. The travel history context frames usage but does not introduce attributes altering the location concept."
718777008,Myroides xuanwuensis (organism),Myroides xuanwuensis bacterium,"Adding 'bacterium' is a clinically accurate descriptor of the taxon without changing the concept from the species Myroides xuanwuensis. This remains an Organism concept and matches SCTID 718777008. No attributes such as site or disease are introduced; thus it does not map to a disorder like 'infection due to Myroides'. Parent concepts like 'Bacteria (organism)' or 'Myroides (organism)' are too broad, and sibling species are incorrect. The synonym is a neutral qualifier maintaining the same species-level identification."
116161004,"Fine needle aspirate of thyroid, cytologic material (specimen)",Pathology specimen — thyroid fine-needle aspirate,"The phrase indicates a pathology specimen consisting of a fine-needle aspirate from the thyroid, which is cytologic material. It falls under the Specimen hierarchy and is best represented by SCTID 116161004. It deliberately avoids procedure framing and does not mention nodule/cyst or laterality, so a more general parent or a more specific child concept would be inaccurate. “Fine-needle aspirate” is a direct synonym for fine needle aspirate and maintains the same semantics."
430244006,Specimen from pericardium (specimen),Patient statement: “They took a sample from my pericardium.”,"The patient-reported phrasing still conveys a specimen obtained from the pericardium, with no mention of method, subtype, or other attributes. This fits the Specimen category in SNOMED CT and corresponds most precisely to “Specimen from pericardium” (430244006). Parent concepts for general thoracic or cardiac specimens are overly broad, and child concepts such as biopsy or excision specimens add collection details not present. Sibling concepts like pericardial fluid specimens are excluded because the statement clearly identifies pericardium as the source rather than fluid."
77023005,Cardiac muscle antibody (substance),Serology analyte: cardiac muscle antibody,"This entry situates the term in a serology report but only names the analyte, which is the substance 'cardiac muscle antibody.' It should be coded as a Substance, SCTID 77023005, because no action (assay) or result is asserted. Using a parent like 'antibody' fails to capture the cardiac muscle target, and children specifying individual cardiac muscle antigens would exceed the given wording. The synonym preserves the original meaning without adding attributes."
361989001,Entire lower lobe of left lung (body structure),"Exam site: complete lower lobe, left lung","The phrase identifies an exam site as the complete lower lobe of the left lung, meaning the whole lobe. It is strictly an anatomical designation. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The precise match is 'Entire lower lobe of left lung' (361989001). Parent concepts lack the completeness qualifier, child concepts would be segmental, and sibling concepts correspond to different lobes or the right lung, which are not indicated here."
6491004,"Protein S, free assay (procedure)",Protein S free fraction assay,"The entry specifies the analyte as the free fraction of Protein S and indicates an assay, without introducing timing, method, or result attributes. This is a laboratory Procedure and corresponds to SNOMED CT 6491004. Broader parent concepts (general Protein S assays) are less specific, while siblings such as total fraction or activity assays target different measures. The phrase ‘free fraction’ is a clinically accepted synonym for ‘free Protein S’, yielding an equivalent code selection."
223831001,Lesbos (geographic location),Toponym: Lesvos,"A toponym is a place name; here, Lesvos denotes the same island as Lesbos. Category: Environment or geographical location. The term clarifies that the value is a geographic name; it does not change the entity being coded. Parent classes would be too broad, and sibling or child locations are not referenced. With no additional attributes, the exact code remains Lesbos (geographic location)."
78087006,Common jaçana (organism),Taxon: Jacana jacana,"This entry presents the taxonomic designation for the species Jacana jacana (Common jacana). The concept is the organism at species rank, without any clinical qualifiers like exposure or infection. In SNOMED CT, organism taxa are represented in the Organism hierarchy; SCTID 78087006 precisely matches this species. Using a parent taxon (genus Jacana) would be too broad, and other species would be siblings and incorrect. 'Taxon' is contextual labeling and does not alter the core concept or code."
473099003,History of use of hormone releasing intrauterine device contraception (situation),Clinical history: prior use of hormonal intrauterine device contraception,"This clinical history statement indicates prior use of a hormonal IUD for contraception. Attributes: prior history, hormonal IUD, contraception. Category: Situation. SCTID 473099003 fits best because it codes history of use of hormone-releasing intrauterine device contraception. Broader or different-status concepts (unspecified IUD history, copper IUD, current use) are less suitable given the precise hormonal and historical phrasing. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
437926005,Streptomyces atroolivaceus (organism),Taxonomic designation — Streptomyces atroolivaceus,"The entry communicates that the term is a taxonomic designation, specifically the species Streptomyces atroolivaceus, and introduces no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Parent taxa are broader than stated, and no child strain is referenced. The precise match is the species concept SCTID 437926005."
782518009,Modified carbapenem inactivation technique (qualifier value),Instrument technique field: modified carbapenem inactivation (mCIM),"This denotes the instrument’s technique field as the modified carbapenem inactivation technique, clarified with mCIM, without additional test or result information. The concept is a technique qualifier (Qualifier value). SCTID 782518009 matches precisely because it names the modified technique. Parent concepts lacking the modification detail are too broad, and siblings like CIM or eCIM represent different techniques. Using the abbreviation is an accepted synonym and does not change the mapping."
304361004,"Passive movements of the interphalangeal joint of thumb, function (observable entity)",Passive movement function measured at the thumb IP joint,"This entry frames passive movement function of the thumb interphalangeal joint as the observable being measured, but it does not include any results or direction-specific details. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 304361004 exactly corresponds to passive movements of the thumb IP joint as a function. Parent concepts are overly broad, child concepts would add specific movements (flexion/extension) or quantitative data, and sibling concepts differ by movement type (active) or joint (MCP), making them less precise. The mention of 'measured' is contextual and does not change the core observable being coded."
110332001,Normal form of root of tooth (finding),Assessment: tooth root contour normal,"The assessment documents normal contour, meaning normal shape/form of the tooth root, a Clinical finding. SCTID 110332001 is the exact code since it represents normal root form. No additional attributes such as tooth site, number, or timing are introduced. Parent concepts are less precise, and siblings referring to crown contour or abnormal root contour do not match this normal finding."
439767004,British Overseas Territories (geographic location),Immigration history: British Overseas Territories,"The statement references the 'British Overseas Territories' as the geographic focus within immigration history. The core concept is the location, which fits SNOMED CT Location (Geographic location) and codes to 'British Overseas Territories' (SCTID 439767004). Broader or different geopolitical parents and narrower child territories are not appropriate given the explicit grouping. The immigration-history context does not introduce additional attributes affecting code selection."
311508002,Mammarenavirus brazilense (organism),Mammarenavirus brazilense — virus species,"The hyphenated note affirms the biological class (virus) and the species name, referring solely to the organism. The main concept is Mammarenavirus brazilense; SNOMED CT category Organism. SCTID 311508002 is the precise species representation. Parent genus or family concepts are broader; any child or sibling would be different. The entry does not add detection or infection attributes, justifying the organism code."
214604006,Accident due to object falling in or on moving motor vehicle on road (event),Narrative: object fell onto the moving motor vehicle on the road leading to an accident,"The narrative specifies an object falling onto a moving motor vehicle on the road, resulting in an accident. The core attributes—falling object, vehicle movement, road context—exactly map to SNOMED CT Event 214604006. It does not mention alternative causes or non-road settings, so parent concepts are too broad and sibling collision/off-road events are unsuitable. The phrasing is a narrative synonym preserving equivalence."
274229005,Fight - assault (event),Assaulted in a fight,"This phrasing denotes that an assault took place within a fight, aligning with 'Fight - assault (event)' (274229005). The passive construction does not introduce additional attributes like injury, timing, or setting. It remains an Event concept and is more exact than coding 'Assault (event)' alone or 'Fight (event)' alone."
225028001,Coming to terms with loss (finding),Psychosocial finding: acceptance of loss,"This entry explicitly labels the state as a psychosocial finding, indicating acceptance of loss. It does not specify the nature of the loss or any temporal/severity qualifiers. As a Clinical finding, it directly matches 'Coming to terms with loss (finding)' and is more accurate than parent concepts like general coping or sibling concepts like grief and bereavement."
86132009,Hemoglobin A>2< Honai (substance),Hemoglobin A>2< Honai,"This phrasing uses the canonical SNOMED rendering 'Hemoglobin A>2<' to denote A2 and adds 'Honai' to specify the exact variant, making it a distinct substance entry. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It targets the named molecule rather than a disorder or a test result; hence the substance code for Hemoglobin A2 Honai is most precise. A parent concept for hemoglobin A2 would omit the variant name and be less specific, while sibling variants like 'Hemoglobin A2 Genova' would be different entities. The wording does not introduce any new clinical attributes."
411496006,Dimethylol dihydroxyethyleneurea (Fix.CPN) (in water) (product),Fixative on protocol: DMDHEU aqueous (Fix.CPN),"The protocol specifies the fixative as DMDHEU in aqueous form with the Fix.CPN designation, corresponding exactly to SNOMED CT 411496006. The concept is a Product. The wording excludes alternative solvents, concentrations, or additional components, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate. 'Aqueous' retains the 'in water' meaning without changing the code."
1333896007,Prone fine needle aspiration biopsy and core needle biopsy of left breast using stereotactic plain X-ray guidance (procedure),Follow-up: Status post prone left breast FNA and core needle biopsy with stereotactic mammographic guidance,"This follow-up note identifies a completed procedure on the left breast involving both FNA and core biopsy, performed in the prone position under stereotactic mammographic (plain X-ray) guidance. It matches SCTID 1333896007 (Procedure). Choosing parent concepts would omit crucial details, and sibling concepts would misrepresent guidance modality, laterality, position, or the combination of techniques."
242600007,Poisoned bite of venomous octopus (event),Reason for visit: poisoned venomous octopus bite,"This entry expresses that the visit is because of a poisoned bite from a venomous octopus, keeping the essential elements intact. The SNOMED concept type is Event, and it maps to 242600007 exactly. Using visit context language does not change clinical attributes. Alternatives like 'octopus bite' are insufficient due to omission of poisoning, and broader 'venomous animal bite' lacks octopus specificity."
43819005,Hemoglobin Kansas (substance),Kansas hemoglobin,"This phrasing reverses the order but still clearly identifies the hemoglobin variant known as Hemoglobin Kansas. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; SCTID 43819005 precisely corresponds to this variant. More general parent concepts (like Hemoglobin) lack the variant-specific designation, and other variant siblings are not referenced. No additional attributes (e.g., findings, tests, severity) are introduced, so the substance concept is the correct selection."
421435008,Vermont (geographic location),Political subdivision: Vermont,"This phrasing identifies Vermont as a political subdivision (a state), but the concept remains the geographic entity Vermont. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (qualifier value). Vermont (geographic location) SCTID 421435008 is the most precise match because the entry denotes the specific state, not a broader domain. Parents such as 'Political subdivision' or 'Geographic location' would lack specificity, and siblings (other states) or children (counties/cities in Vermont) are not mentioned. No additional clinical or temporal attributes are present."
259080001,Erythrocytes/100 milliliters/second (qualifier value),Unit notation: erythrocytes/100 mL/s,"This specifies the unit notation as erythrocytes per 100 mL per second, aligning exactly with the concept’s structure. The main concept is the unit itself, with attributes of erythrocytes numerator, 100 mL denominator, and per second time. Category: Qualifier value. It is the most precise match to SCTID 259080001; broader or different units (e.g., per liter or per minute) are sibling concepts and incorrect here. No extra attributes are introduced beyond the unit expression."
251733002,Local abnormality of angle (finding),Localised abnormality of angle,"This phrasing uses the British spelling “localised,” which is a clinically equivalent synonym for “local,” and continues to refer to an abnormality of an anatomical angle. The main concept remains a localized structural finding affecting an angle. Category: Clinical finding. It aligns exactly with SCTID 251733002 because it conveys localization without specifying which angle or adding attributes. Parent concepts would be too general, and child/sibling concepts tied to specific anatomical angles or to causes (e.g., congenital) are not appropriate, as none are specified here."
177220003,Immediate repair of obstetric laceration of vagina and floor of pelvis (procedure),Immediate sutured repair of childbirth lacerations at vagina and pelvic floor,This entry indicates an immediate sutured repair procedure for childbirth (obstetric) lacerations targeting both the vagina and pelvic floor. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It fits SCTID 177220003 by combining immediate timing and exact anatomical sites. Concepts like repair of obstetric laceration without anatomic detail or single-site procedures would be less precise. “Sutured repair” is a standard synonym for repair and does not change the intended code.
293933008,Allergy to thiethylperazine (finding),Thiethylperazine allergy,"This phrasing is a direct synonym for being allergic to thiethylperazine and does not add any qualifiers such as severity or reaction type. It represents a Clinical finding of drug allergy to a named substance and maps precisely to Allergy to thiethylperazine (293933008). It is more specific than broader parent concepts like Allergy to drug and does not suggest a one-time adverse event, intolerance, or sensitivity, so sibling or child concepts are inappropriate. The synonym does not change the code selection because it is clinically equivalent."
171677003,Exploration of facial nerve (VII) (procedure),Facial nerve exploration,"The entry explicitly names the procedure of exploring the facial (seventh cranial) nerve, without introducing approach, laterality, repair, or other attributes. The main medical concept is surgical exploration of the facial nerve. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps precisely to SNOMED CT 171677003 (Exploration of facial nerve (VII)), rather than to broader parents like exploration of cranial/peripheral nerves or to siblings such as exploration of other cranial nerves. No child concept (e.g., specifying approach or segment) is indicated, and the straightforward phrasing ensures the intended procedure code is the most accurate match."
1359732001,Subconjunctival implantation of biodegradable collagen matrix into right eye (procedure),Right eye—subconjunctival placement of biodegradable collagen matrix.,"This succinctly captures the procedure: placement (implantation) of a biodegradable collagen matrix in the subconjunctival region of the right eye. It is a Procedure. The attributes—site, material, and laterality—align exactly with SCTID 1359732001. Parent concepts lacking laterality or biodegradability, or alternate site procedures (e.g., episcleral or intraocular), are not as specific. 'Placement' is an accepted synonym for 'implantation' without altering the intended code."
117591000181106,Companilactobacillus furfuricola (organism),16S rRNA identified species: Companilactobacillus furfuricola,"The text specifies a 16S rRNA identification and provides the species Companilactobacillus furfuricola. Category: Organism. SCTID 117591000181106 is the correct species code. A genus-level code would be insufficiently specific, and there is no strain or subspecies detail. The method reference is contextual and does not imply a different SNOMED category such as a clinical finding."
768306001,Product containing phospholipid (product),Pharmacy record: phospholipid medicinal product,"Within a pharmacy record context, the entry denotes a medicinal product characterized by inclusion of a phospholipid. No added specifics are present. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The best match is 768306001 Product containing phospholipid. Parent groupers lacking ingredient specification are too broad, while children identifying a unique phospholipid (e.g., phosphatidylcholine) would be more specific than the record indicates."
736604007,Inhaler technique demonstrated by patient (situation),Patient demonstrated inhaler technique,"This phrasing conveys that the patient carried out a demonstration of how they use an inhaler, aligning directly with 736604007. The main concept is patient demonstration; no evaluation, teaching, or device-specific details are introduced. Category: Situation. It is narrower than broader context concepts and avoids siblings such as education/training or clinician demonstration. The synonym choice (“demonstrated”) is clinically equivalent to “demonstrated by patient” and does not change the code."
350623006,Product containing ergot alkaloid (product),Drug product containing an ergot alkaloid,"The entry denotes a drug product and specifies the ingredient class ""ergot alkaloid,"" which is the defining property of the SNOMED CT product concept Product containing ergot alkaloid (product) 350623006. ""Drug product"" is a standard synonym for medicinal product and does not alter code selection. No individual alkaloid, dose form, or added components are mentioned, so parent or sibling concepts are less precise, and child concepts for specific alkaloids are not justified."
15361003,"Operation of a device, function (observable entity)",Report item — device function operation,"This phrasing situates the observable within a report context but still denotes the same property: operation of a device’s function, without values or status. The category is Observable entity. The content aligns with SCTID 15361003, focusing on the property being documented. Parent concepts like general device function are less precise, while siblings or children that specify operational status, results, or device type would add attributes not present. The contextual phrase “report item” does not change the semantic target; it remains the specific observable."
60359007,Structure of antral aditus of tympanic cavity (body structure),Tympanic aditus to mastoid antrum,"‘Tympanic aditus’ refers to the opening in the tympanic cavity, and the addition ‘to mastoid antrum’ specifies its connection, making it the aditus ad antrum. This is a Body structure exactly captured by SCTID 60359007. Broader anatomical parents (e.g., ‘Ear structure’) lack the specificity, while siblings such as ‘Eustachian tube’ or ‘Mastoid antrum’ denote different structures. The synonym is clinically equivalent and introduces no new attributes."
247730001,Verbal auditory hallucinations (finding),Chart note: verbal auditory hallucinations,This entry records the presence of verbal auditory hallucinations in the chart; the context of documentation does not change the underlying finding. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 247730001 precisely matches verbal auditory hallucinations. More general or alternative auditory hallucination subtypes would be incorrect as the entry specifies verbal content. The wording is synonymous with the preferred term and does not introduce additional attributes.
443001000124103,Adult high calorie high protein formula (product),"Adult high energy, protein-dense formula","This entry denotes a formula for adults that is high energy (high calorie) and protein-dense (high protein), retaining the core attributes of the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent and do not alter code selection. Concepts that are non-age-specific or that only indicate high energy without high protein (or vice versa) would not match the exact phrase."
79850008,Augusticeps-type venom (substance),Label text: Augusticeps-type venom,"This entry reflects labeling content while indicating only the substance name Augusticeps-type venom. The category is Substance. SNOMED CT 79850008 fits precisely, avoiding broader categories like generic venom and excluding child-level specificity such as component toxins or purified fractions. No attributes of exposure, detection, or formulation are introduced."
612211000124105,Cladosporium-like organism (organism),Report notation: Cladosporium-like organism,"This report notation records an organism characterized as Cladosporium-like, i.e., resembling Cladosporium without established taxonomic certainty. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Cladosporium-like organism (612211000124105) is the correct code. It should not be coded to Cladosporium genus or species-level concepts due to the lack of confirmation, and it is more specific than general fungal organism codes because it targets Cladosporium resemblance. No disorder semantics are present."
171617007,Excision of lesion of glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) (procedure),Operative report: excision of lesion of glossopharyngeal nerve,"This operative report entry documents excision of a lesion on the glossopharyngeal nerve, making it a Procedure that corresponds to SCTID 171617007. The context of an operative report does not alter the clinical action or target structure. Parent codes for cranial nerve lesion excision are too broad, and sibling concepts such as nerve sectioning, neurolysis, or tumor-type-specific excision would either misstate the procedure or add attributes not present here. The wording is a direct match to the preferred term."
701053008,Neuromuscular rigidity analyzer (physical object),Neuromuscular rigidity analyzer at bedside,"The phrase denotes the presence of a neuromuscular rigidity analyzer, with 'at bedside' serving as context for location, not a device attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The device named is exactly the neuromuscular rigidity analyzer, so SCTID 701053008 fits best. Parent or sibling terms would either be too broad or target different functions (e.g., general monitors). No added attributes such as type, brand, or method are introduced, maintaining precise alignment."
242863009,Assault by poisoning with perfume spray (event),Attacked and poisoned with perfume spray,"‘Attacked’ is a clinically acceptable synonym for assault in event coding, and ‘poisoned with perfume spray’ specifies the mechanism and agent. Main concepts: assault, poisoning, perfume spray. SNOMED CT category: Event. This maps to SCTID 242863009. Using a code for poisoning by perfume (disorder) would misclassify the entry as a condition rather than an event, and removing either assault or perfume spray from coding would be incomplete."
33195004,External beam radiation therapy procedure (procedure),EBRT (external beam radiation therapy),"EBRT is a widely used abbreviation for external beam radiation therapy and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term. The main concept remains a Procedure, and the code 33195004 is exact. The parent concept 'Radiation therapy' would be less precise because it could include internal methods; children like stereotactic or intensity-modulated techniques are not indicated, as no technique subtype or target attributes are present."
20111001,Blue vanga (organism),Observed species noted as blue vanga,"The sentence indicates that the observed species has been noted as Blue vanga, specifying the exact species without adding extra attributes. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Organism hierarchy, specifically Blue vanga (organism) SCTID 20111001. Parent taxa or other vanga species would be less accurate. The observation context simply frames the identification and does not modify the organism concept."
405661003,Directed donor whole blood (product),Directed donor whole blood unit,"This phrasing explicitly identifies a whole blood unit sourced from a directed donor, which is a Product. The term 'unit' is typical in inventory or issuance notes and does not imply administration or additional processing. It is not better represented by a parent 'whole blood product' or by sibling products (e.g., directed donor platelets), so SCTID 405661003 is correct."
363975001,Upper lacrimal punctum feature (observable entity),Characteristics of the upper lacrimal punctum,"The term 'characteristics' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'feature' in the observable context. Main concept: characteristics/features of the upper lacrimal punctum. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. This maps directly to SCTID 363975001 by capturing the generic observable of the upper punctum without adding specificity like size or patency and without implying a diagnosis. Parent or sibling observables (e.g., characteristics of lacrimal punctum unspecified, lower punctum characteristics) are excluded by the 'upper' qualifier."
280592008,Structure of linea semilunaris (body structure),Chart annotation — linea semilunaris,"A chart annotation naming the linea semilunaris continues to represent the same anatomical Body structure. SNOMED CT 280592008 is the correct code. Parent or sibling concepts covering broader or different abdominal landmarks are less specific. No laterality, severity, or associated conditions are mentioned, keeping it within the generic structure concept rather than child or disorder concepts."
223797006,Galway (geographic location),Follow-up scheduled in Galway,"This notes that follow-up occurs in the place “Galway,” naming only the geographic location. Category: Geographic location (location). There are no administrative qualifiers or sub-locations, so the most accurate code is Galway (geographic location) SCTID 223797006. Using a parent category would be nonspecific, while selecting “County Galway,” “Galway City,” or a facility concept would add detail not present in the text."
264202004,Subaortic (qualifier value),Position relative to aorta: subaortic,"The entry specifies a positional relationship to the aorta as subaortic, meaning below it. No additional clinical attributes are present. This is a pure spatial qualifier, mapping precisely to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value Subaortic (264202004). Broader positional qualifiers would be nonspecific, and alternatives like supra-aortic (above) or retro-aortic (behind) would change the intended relation. Therefore, the given concept is the most accurate match."
410246000,Skin breakdown control assessment (procedure),Skin breakdown control assessment documented,"The entry denotes that the procedure—assessment of skin breakdown control—was documented, without adding clinical attributes beyond the assessment itself. Category: Procedure. Skin breakdown control assessment (procedure), SCTID 410246000, is the precise mapping as it identifies the specific assessment. Parent concepts covering documentation or general assessment are too broad, and sibling concepts (risk assessment, skin examination) target different aims. Documentation context does not change the underlying procedural concept."
373101006,Breast cytologic material obtained by percutaneous core biopsy (specimen),Breast core needle biopsy—cytology sample (percutaneous),"This denotes a cytology specimen from the breast obtained via percutaneous core needle biopsy. The main concepts are cytology sample (cells), breast site, and core needle biopsy performed percutaneously. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps to SCTID 373101006, which specifies cytologic material and percutaneous core biopsy. A sibling like “breast tissue specimen” would imply histologic tissue rather than cells. Mentioning “percutaneous” aligns with the defined method; using “core needle biopsy” is clinically equivalent to “core biopsy” and does not change the code."
463530008,Microdialysis system pump (physical object),OR equipment setup: microdialysis pump,"This references the microdialysis pump included in an OR setup, focusing on the device itself. Category: Physical object (device). The operating room context does not change the identity of the object, nor add attributes like flow rate or brand. It is specific to microdialysis and not a generic or sibling pump type. It is not the microdialysis catheter or analyzer. SCTID 463530008 is the correct and specific code."
224073003,Nevada (geographic location),Nevada (geographic location),"The entry mirrors the preferred term format, clearly indicating the location concept. The main concept is the place Nevada, with no added qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Location. More general parents like Geographic location are too broad, and no specific child area is named. This is a direct, unambiguous match to SCTID 224073003."
215977006,"Forced landing while landing, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)","Airliner crew injury due to forced landing at landing, surface-to-surface transport.","This is an Event describing crew injury on an airliner (commercial aircraft) related to a forced landing occurring in the landing phase, specifying the surface-to-surface air transport modality. 'Airliner' is a common synonym for commercial aircraft, and 'crew' conveys member of crew without role specificity. It matches SCTID 215977006 and is not better represented by parent concepts such as unspecified aircraft accidents or sibling concepts like passenger involved. No timing other than landing phase is introduced, and no injury details are added."
213796001,"Train collision with buffers, railway employee injured (event)",Train-buffer collision causing injury to a railway employee,"This describes an event where a train collided with buffers and a railway employee was injured, covering both key attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 213796001 is the most precise code, specifying the collision object and the injured party type. More general train accidents or unspecified collisions would be too broad, and sibling codes targeting passengers or non-employees would be mismatched. The phrase ‘train-buffer collision’ is a valid paraphrase of ‘train collision with buffers’ without changing meaning."
424731001,Branta canadensis minima (organism),Branta c. minima,"This taxonomic shorthand abbreviates the species name while retaining the subspecies epithet ‘minima’, pointing unequivocally to Branta canadensis minima. It corresponds to the SNOMED CT organism concept (SCTID: 424731001). The specificity to the minima subspecies rules out the species-level parent and other subspecies siblings, and no additional attributes are introduced."
1366364006,Epileptic seizures induced by visual stimulation (finding),Epileptic seizures occur with visual stimulation,"This describes the occurrence of epileptic seizures concurrent with visual stimulation, conveying a stimulus-induced relationship. It is a Clinical finding. The phrasing is equivalent to “induced by visual stimulation,” without adding timing, severity, or seizure subtype. Parent concepts lacking stimulus details are less specific, and disorder concepts like photosensitive epilepsy are not appropriate because the statement is about a finding, not a diagnosis. Therefore, SCTID 1366364006 is the correct, specific code."
259641008,Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (substance),Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag),"The entry provides the full name with its common abbreviation, explicitly identifying the SCC antigen substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. There is no implication of measurement or positivity/negativity, excluding observable and procedure concepts. Generic parents (e.g., Antigen) are less precise, and disorder concepts are not referenced. The abbreviation is a clinically safe synonym that does not alter the code selection."
2754009,Hemoglobin F-Kennestone (substance),Hemoglobin F Kennestone,"This is a hyphenation-free rendering of the same substance name, maintaining the precise identification of the Kennestone variant of hemoglobin F without adding any clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 2754009 is the correct code since the term refers specifically to Hemoglobin F-Kennestone; more general parent concepts or different named variants (siblings) do not fit this wording. The absence of a hyphen does not change the meaning and is a common stylistic variation in documentation."
106837001,Family Haemogamasidae (organism),Family-level organism: Haemogamasidae,"This entry specifies Haemogamasidae as an organism at the family level, which is the SNOMED CT Organism concept SCTID 106837001. The wording is purely taxonomic and does not imply clinical findings, presence, or causation. Mapping to higher-level mites would not be precise enough, and mapping to lower-level genera would add specificity not warranted by the text. The paraphrase 'family-level organism' is semantically equivalent to ‘family classification’ and does not change code selection."
81679007,Blood group antibody Chase (substance),Anti-Chase reagent (blood group antibody),"The entry frames the anti-Chase antibody as a reagent used in immunohematology testing, identifying the substance without conveying patient findings. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This maps to 81679007 because the reagent is the blood group antibody against Chase. A parent concept like generic blood group antibody reagent would be less specific, and siblings such as antibodies to other antigens would be inaccurate. The term 'reagent' does not alter the substance identity and adds no extraneous attributes."
1251637004,Partner reassured (situation),Partner received reassurance.,"The statement indicates the partner was the recipient of reassurance, which is the exact focus of the concept, and adds no extra details. It is a SNOMED Situation. Saying “received reassurance” is equivalent to “was reassured,” maintaining alignment with “Partner reassured (situation)” [1251637004]. Parent concepts that omit the recipient are less specific, and sibling concepts specifying a different recipient would be inappropriate. The wording does not introduce timing, reason, or severity."
156009,"Spine board, device (physical object)",Backboard for spinal immobilization,"This entry denotes a backboard explicitly for spinal immobilization, which is the functional description of a spine board. SNOMED CT category: Device (Physical object). The wording indicates the same device concept as SCTID 156009 without adding attributes such as size or material. It does not imply a different device type (e.g., vacuum splint), and is more specific than a generic 'backboard' by tying it to spinal use, preserving the exact spine board concept."
708449009,Erwinia oleae (organism),Record entry — Erwinia oleae,"A record entry with the name Erwinia oleae denotes the species only, avoiding any mention of detection, infection, or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 708449009 exactly matches the species. Parent concepts like Erwinia (genus) or Bacteria are too broad, and sibling species would be incorrect. There is no suggestion of a child concept such as a specific strain."
266902008,Family history: Liver disease (situation),Family history of liver condition.,"‘Liver condition’ is a general clinical synonym for liver disease/disorder. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The best code is SCTID 266902008, which captures family history of liver disease without detail about type, cause, or kinship. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling/child concepts for specific liver pathologies are not indicated."
84059002,Pinguinain (substance),Pinguinain protease,"The term specifies pinguinain and its functional class (protease), which is intrinsic to the substance. The category is Substance. Pinguinain (substance), SCTID 84059002, is the precise code because it names the specific protease. General parent concepts like Protease (substance) would be imprecise, and other proteases are siblings rather than this specific enzyme. No role, dose, or product form is implied, keeping the mapping to the substance."
401156005,Plasma osmolality (observable entity),Plasma osmolality parameter,"Referring to osmolality as a ‘parameter’ keeps the focus on the observable property without implying a procedure or result interpretation. Main concept: plasma osmolality. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 401156005 is appropriate since it targets osmolality measured in plasma. Broader or different-specimen concepts (e.g., blood or serum osmolality) and different quantity types (osmolarity) are less accurate given the explicit plasma osmolality reference."
242556004,Accident caused by tidal flooding (event),Accident caused by tidal inundation,"The term 'tidal inundation' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of tidal flooding, maintaining the same causative mechanism for the accident. No extra attributes are present. The category is Event. The code 242556004 is the correct selection because it matches accidents due to tidal flooding/inundation. Parent or sibling concepts involving non-tidal inundation or other water events would not be as precise."
731010009,Entire C2/C3 intervertebral foramen (body structure),Imaging focus: C2–C3 intervertebral foramen,"Though placed in an imaging context, the named anatomical target is the entire intervertebral foramen at C2–C3. Category: Body structure. The precise code is SCTID 731010009. Parent concepts lack level specificity, and lateralized or partial-structure children are not suggested by the wording. There is no pathology, severity, or timing added."
421861001,Structure of subclavian lymph node (body structure),Subclavian LN (lymph node),"The entry uses the accepted abbreviation LN for lymph node and clarifies it parenthetically, naming the subclavian lymph node without attributes such as laterality, number, or pathology. The main concept is the anatomical subclavian lymph node, and the SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This maps to Structure of subclavian lymph node (421861001) because ‘LN’ is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not alter meaning. A parent like Structure of lymph node lacks the subclavian qualifier, and child concepts adding laterality would be too specific. Sibling options like axillary lymph node represent different topography."
224858000,Public school (environment),Educational environment: public school,"The main concept is an educational environment specified as a public school. Category: Environment or geographical location. ‘Educational environment’ as a context label does not add attributes; it frames the environment type. SNOMED CT code 224858000 is the correct, specific match, more detailed than School (environment) and distinct from siblings such as Private school (environment). No modifiers such as level of schooling, incident, or activity are present, keeping the mapping unambiguous to the public school environment."
411420006,Arnica montana allergen patch test product (product),Arnica montana contact allergen patch-testing product,"The combination of 'contact allergen' and 'patch-testing product' specifies a product used for epicutaneous contact allergy testing with Arnica montana. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It does not imply test outcome, formulation specifics, or alternate testing methods, and it is more specific than a generic contact allergen product, matching the exact concept."
711230009,Support for caregiver during weaning declined (situation),Weaning-related caregiver support not accepted,"This expresses that caregiver support linked to weaning was not accepted, which is a Situation. It maps to SCTID 711230009 because it captures refusal of caregiver support in the weaning context. Parent concepts lacking the declined attribute or those not specifying the caregiver/weaning linkage would be less accurate. Sibling concepts showing acceptance or provision are inconsistent with 'not accepted'. The phrase uses a clinically equivalent synonym for declined without adding new attributes."
91784009,Structure of palmar carpal branch of ulnar artery (body structure),Documented vessel: palmar carpal branch of ulnar artery,"The text documents an arterial structure and names it specifically as the palmar carpal branch of the ulnar artery. Category: Body structure. SCTID 91784009 is the most precise match, as it identifies this exact branch and not the general ulnar artery or another branch like the dorsal carpal. The contextual verb 'documented' does not change the anatomical identity, so the body structure code remains appropriate."
228498004,Age at starting snuff use (observable entity),Age at commencement of snuff use,"The phrase indicates the age when snuff use commenced, representing the same observable variable. It is classified as an Observable entity since it describes a characteristic to be measured, not a clinical finding with a value. SNOMED CT 228498004 is the correct and precise code, as it pertains specifically to snuff; choosing a parent like age at starting tobacco use or a sibling like age at starting cigarette smoking would be less precise. 'Commencement' is a synonym for 'start' that does not alter the concept."
122709008,Specimen from ovary obtained by incisional biopsy (specimen),Pathology specimen - ovary (incisional biopsy),"This entry indicates a pathology specimen from the ovary, specifying incisional biopsy as the collection method. The core concept is a specimen; attributes include source and technique. It maps directly to SCTID 122709008. More general parent concepts lack the technique, and siblings involving different biopsy types are unsuitable. The inclusion of 'pathology specimen' is contextual and does not alter the underlying specimen concept or code."
430534005,Family history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid (situation),Radiology requisition: family history—thyroid cancer,"The requisition lists a family history item of thyroid cancer, indicating malignant neoplasm of the thyroid in relatives. This is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 430534005 best captures family history of malignant neoplasm of thyroid. More general family history of cancer would be less specific, and personal history codes would be inappropriate. The synonym “thyroid cancer” is equivalent and does not add detail such as subtype or relation degree that would necessitate a child concept."
362117005,Entire gingival attachment (body structure),Gingival tissue attachment,"“Gingival tissue attachment” is a synonymous anatomical reference to gingival attachment and corresponds to SNOMED CT Body structure 362117005. The wording does not add histologic detail or functional attributes beyond the core structure and does not imply a pathology or a procedure. It is not the same as “attached gingiva” (a specific tissue portion) or other periodontal components, making the chosen concept the most accurate."
5167005,Zinc chloride fumes (substance),History note term recorded: zinc chloride fumes,"The history note records the substance name without adding clinical attributes; it specifies zinc chloride fumes. Main concept: zinc chloride fumes. Category: Substance. No events, measurements, or hazard claims are present. Generic zinc chloride or different physical states would be less precise. Therefore, SNOMED CT concept 5167005 is the most accurate code."
215877007,"Aircraft collision while taking off, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)",Initial assessment: airline crew injury from takeoff aircraft collision (surface-to-surface transport).,"The assessment documents an airline (commercial) crew member injured by an aircraft collision during takeoff, with the surface-to-surface transport classification. SNOMED CT category: Event. This corresponds to SCTID 215877007 because it contains collision, takeoff phase, commercial crew, and injury attributes. Parents and siblings lacking or changing these attributes would be less appropriate. The phrasing is a valid synonym and introduces no additional qualifiers."
731104007,Entire lateral border of sole (body structure),Documented site—entire lateral margin of the sole,"The anatomical target is the entire lateral margin of the sole; 'margin' equals 'border,' and the 'entire' qualifier ensures the whole lateral edge is referenced. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This matches the exact concept by specifying the lateral border of the plantar surface and its entirety. More general parents or other borders/surfaces (medial, dorsal, forefoot-only) would be incorrect. The documentation context does not add attributes, and the synonym 'margin' does not alter code selection."
247013009,Fixed constriction of pupil (finding),"Constricted, nonreactive pupil noted","This documentation confirms a pupil that is constricted and nonreactive, i.e., fixed constriction. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It does not add laterality, timing, or causation. Sibling concepts such as nonreactive pupil without size specification or fixed dilatation do not match, and miosis alone lacks the fixed attribute."
783679008,Product containing xenon and/or xenon compound (product),Supply item: product containing xenon or xenon compound,"This is a product identified in a supply context that contains xenon or a xenon compound; no attributes like indication, dosage, or route are introduced. The SNOMED category is Product, and SCTID 783679008 is the precise match because it covers products containing xenon and/or xenon compounds. Broader parents (e.g., supply items containing chemicals) lack specificity to xenon, and children limited to xenon-only or xenon-compound–only are narrower than the stated scope. The supply context does not alter the underlying product concept."
216448007,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, prairie (environment)",History notes: the accident/poisoning event was on the prairie.,"The history note states that the accident or poisoning event occurred on the prairie, indicating place-of-occurrence. The main concept is environmental site-of-occurrence with prairie as the location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It matches Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, prairie (environment) exactly, whereas parent or sibling concepts would be less specific or incorrect. The phrasing is neutral and does not add mechanisms, severity, or temporal detail beyond occurrence."
766904001,Product containing azo derivative (product),Catalog entry — pharmaceutical product with azo derivative,"The main concept is a pharmaceutical product that contains an azo derivative; catalog context is non-determinative for code. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The wording is equivalent to the FSN, preserving the ingredient class and product nature without added attributes. Thus, the best match is 766904001, not a parent generic product nor a child with a specified azo compound."
372303007,Ratio of blocks with prostate tumor to total number of blocks obtained (observable entity),Fraction of blocks containing prostate tumor among all blocks obtained,"The term 'fraction' here is a synonym for ratio, indicating the proportion of tumor-containing blocks in a prostate specimen relative to the total blocks obtained. This is an Observable entity and maps to SCTID 372303007. Using 'fraction' does not change the scale versus ratio; it avoids implying a percent. Concepts like 'percentage of blocks' or 'number of blocks with tumor' are siblings/children with different measurement forms, and generic tumor block ratios lacking the prostate qualifier would be less specific than this entry."
223397008,Reunion (geographic location),Destination: Réunion,"Réunion is used as a destination place, retaining the core concept of a geographic location. The correct SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location), and the exact match is Reunion (SCTID: 223397008). Selecting any broader parent would reduce specificity, and choosing administrative-area or city-level children would misrepresent the entry. The contextual term “Destination” does not add attributes altering the place; it simply situates the same location concept in a logistics/travel context."
256390004,Red cells - washed - irradiated (product),Red cell product—washed then irradiated,"The entry describes a red cell product processed first by washing and then by irradiation; both attributes are explicit. SNOMED CT category: Product. The sequence does not alter the concept; it remains a precise match to SCTID 256390004. Parent red cell product concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts with only one processing step are incomplete. No additional modifiers (e.g., donor type, antigen profile, volume) are present."
838296001,Buphthalmos of bilateral eyes (finding),Buphthalmia of both eyes,"“Buphthalmia” is an accepted synonym for buphthalmos and the entry specifies both eyes, confirming bilateral laterality. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT. SCTID 838296001 matches exactly due to the explicit bilateral buphthalmos. A laterality-unspecified parent would be less exact, and single-eye children are ruled out by “both eyes.” The synonym does not add cause or severity and is clinically equivalent to buphthalmos."
411487006,PPD black rubber mix (product),Barcode scanned: PPD black rubber mix,"The barcode scan context identifies the product 'PPD black rubber mix,' aligning with SNOMED CT Product SCTID 411487006. The entry does not introduce clinical attributes, dosage, or substance-only references. It is more specific than a generic black rubber mix and avoids clinical finding mappings. The product identity remains unchanged by the inventory workflow context."
223778006,Queensland (geographic location),State of Queensland,"The phrase is a semantically equivalent synonym for the state-level geographic entity, with no extra attributes. The main concept is the Australian state Queensland, which maps to SNOMED CT Location (Geographic location). The best code is 223778006. Using “state of” clarifies administrative level but does not change the concept. More general parents (e.g., geographic location) are overly broad, and siblings like other Australian states would not match the named entity."
119395005,Specimen from uterine cervix (specimen),Source on requisition: uterine cervix,"A requisition note specifying that the specimen’s source is the uterine cervix. The concept is a Specimen with anatomical source as the only attribute. SCTID 119395005 precisely models this. Using a parent would be too broad, and using a child (e.g., endocervical specimen, cervical swab) would add unmentioned method or subsite details."
412086005,Ammonium phosphate (substance),Ammonium phosphate,"The main concept is the chemical substance ammonium phosphate. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Substance. The wording matches the preferred term exactly and does not introduce any formulation, grade, or stoichiometric detail, so it aligns most precisely with SCTID 412086005. More general parents like phosphate or ammonium salts would be too broad, while children or siblings such as monoammonium phosphate or diammonium phosphate would be too specific and imply a particular stoichiometry not stated here."
464735006,Unwrapped-device steam sterilizer (physical object),Device listing: steam sterilizer for unwrapped items,"Main concept: steam sterilizer intended for unwrapped items, referenced in a device list. Category: Physical object. This matches SCTID 464735006 exactly by naming both the modality and the unwrapped usage. Parent concepts omit the unwrapped focus; sibling or procedure entries would be misaligned. The contextual preface does not change the concept."
701781010000106,Immunoglobulin G4 antibody to Hippoglossus hippoglossus (substance),Anti–Hippoglossus hippoglossus IgG4,"Using the conventional 'anti-' format, this indicates an IgG4 antibody directed against Hippoglossus hippoglossus. It represents a Substance in SNOMED CT, not an observation or procedure, as there is no result or testing context implied. It is more specific than parent concepts like anti-fish IgG4 and distinct from sibling concepts such as anti–Hippoglossus hippoglossus IgE. The 'anti-' construction is a well-understood synonym for antibody specificity and does not alter the code selection."
698801008,Respiratory therapy by control of atmospheric pressure and composition (procedure),Controlled ambient air therapy for breathing support,"This denotes therapy for breathing support delivered via controlled ambient air, implying regulation of both atmospheric pressure and composition rather than device-delivered gases. It fits the Procedure category. The synonym ""controlled ambient air therapy"" is clinically equivalent to controlling atmospheric pressure and composition. By avoiding specific techniques, it does not map to a child concept, and it differs from siblings such as oxygen via mask or airway pressure ventilation, justifying SCTID 698801008."
702987002,Streptococcus sanguinis or Streptococcus gordonii (finding),Microbiology result: S. sanguinis vs S. gordonii (indeterminate between the two),"The entry situates the finding in a microbiology context and explicitly states that the organism is indeterminate between S. sanguinis and S. gordonii. It does not introduce site, timing, or disease state. This is a Clinical finding, and SCTID 702987002 is the most precise match. A broader parent would omit the specified species pair, and a single-species child would ignore the stated indeterminacy. The wording reflects a typical lab report phrasing without altering the concept."
223367000,Channel islands (geographic location),Toponym: Channel Islands,"“Toponym” indicates a place name and does not alter the concept; the substantive content is the location “Channel Islands.” This sits in the Environment or geographical location category and maps to SCTID 223367000. It does not reference a component island or a different archipelago, so parent or sibling concepts would be less precise. No additional clinical or situational attributes are introduced."
237368004,Total mastectomy and excision of part of pectoral muscles and chest wall (procedure),Complete mastectomy and partial excision of the chest wall and pectoral muscles,"This entry restates the preferred term with synonyms ('complete' for 'total') and maintains the required dual partial excisions of chest wall and pectoral muscles. It belongs to the Procedure category and maps to SCTID 237368004. It does not suggest axillary dissection or full muscle removal, so radical mastectomy siblings are not appropriate, and generic mastectomy parents are insufficient."
770541001,Assessment using Trauma Screening Questionnaire (procedure),TSQ administered,"This concise entry states that the TSQ (Trauma Screening Questionnaire) was administered. The concept is the procedural use of the TSQ instrument, a Procedure in SNOMED CT. It corresponds exactly to 'Assessment using Trauma Screening Questionnaire (procedure)' SCTID 770541001. Generic parents like 'questionnaire administered' are less specific, and other instrument siblings would not apply. 'Administered' is a clinically equivalent synonym for performing the assessment and does not introduce extra attributes."
716677007,Evacuation of blood from pleural cavity (procedure),Evacuation of blood from pleural cavity,"The main concept is the procedural removal of blood from the pleural cavity, which represents evacuation of a hemothorax without specifying approach, laterality, or timing. This is a SNOMED CT Procedure and maps precisely to 716677007 Evacuation of blood from pleural cavity. Broader parents such as generic pleural drainage or evacuation from pleural cavity are less accurate because they do not specify blood. Siblings like evacuation of air or pus are inappropriate as the evacuated material differs. The wording matches the preferred term exactly and introduces no extra attributes, avoiding children that specify technique (e.g., chest tube or thoracentesis)."
256605009,Dental die - stone (substance),Dental lab material: die stone,"The entry denotes the substance 'die stone' within a laboratory context, but the core concept remains the material itself. Category: Substance. SCTID 256605009 is the precise code for dental die stone. Alternatives like 'Dental stone' (parent) or 'Plaster' (sibling) would misrepresent specificity. The context term 'lab material' does not introduce any attribute that changes the concept; it still encodes the same substance."
411855003,Castor bean specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Specific diagnostic allergen—castor bean extract,"This indicates a single-source diagnostic allergen product derived from castor bean, focusing on the extract as a product. Main concept: diagnostic allergen extract (castor bean). SNOMED CT category: Product. The entry aligns with the exact product concept and excludes parent generic allergen classes and sibling therapeutic extracts, with no extra attributes introduced."
41469002,Oncogene protein (substance),Discussion term: oncogene protein,"The entry identifies the term used in discussion; the concept remains 'oncogene protein'. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 41469002 is appropriate because it denotes the protein substance arising from an oncogene. A parent concept like 'Protein' fails to convey the oncogene linkage, whereas child concepts naming particular proteins would be too specific. Sibling concepts involving genetic material or procedures are less suitable because no such attributes are included."
62532006,Salmonella Veneziana (organism),Report organism: Salmonella Veneziana,"The phrase presents Salmonella Veneziana as the organism reported, keeping the focus on the organism entity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, aligning with SCTID 62532006. It does not introduce attributes such as presence in the patient or clinical severity, thereby avoiding misclassification as a finding. Parent concepts lack serovar precision, and different serovars would be incorrect siblings."
390839009,History of facial injury (situation),Chart notes prior injury to face,"This wording reflects a medical record entry indicating the patient previously had an injury involving the face. The main concept is historical facial injury, with attributes confined to past context and anatomical site. As a Situation, this aligns with History of facial injury (390839009). Codes for current facial injury would be inappropriate, and more granular history entries (e.g., particular facial bone injuries) are not supported by the non-specific phrasing."
473170005,History of bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination (situation),Historical BCG immunization,"The wording directly denotes that the BCG immunization is a historical event for this patient. The category is Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT code 473170005 best captures this meaning. Using 'immunization' instead of 'vaccination' is clinically equivalent. A parent concept like History of vaccination would be nonspecific, and the procedure concept for BCG vaccination would incorrectly imply a current intervention rather than history."
216927004,Failure of sterile precautions during surgical operation (event),OR sterility breach during surgery.,"The entry reports a sterility breach and specifies the operating room and that it occurred during surgery, which equates to failure of sterile precautions during surgical operation. The SNOMED CT category is Event. “Sterility breach” is an accepted synonym for failure of sterile precautions, and referencing the OR and surgery fits SCTID 216927004. Broader failure-of-sterility concepts not tied to a surgical operation, or more specific contamination-related events, are not as accurate here."
418757007,Accidental ingestion of potentially harmful entity (event),Chief complaint documented as accidental ingestion of a potentially harmful entity,"Even within chief complaint context, the clinical content remains an accidental ingestion of something potentially harmful, matching SNOMED CT Event 418757007. No specific substance, effect, or alternative exposure route is stated. This is more precise than general accidental exposure and less specific than foreign body ingestion or poisoning, so parent or sibling concepts are not better fits. The documentation context does not change the concept or add attributes."
223931000,Regions of Scotland (geographic location),Study recruitment location: regions of Scotland,"The research context indicates where recruitment occurs, but the geographic concept is still “regions of Scotland.” Main concept: regions of Scotland as the recruitment location category. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. It aligns to Regions of Scotland (223931000), not to the parent Scotland nor a specific child region. No timing or administrative qualifiers beyond context are added, ensuring the location code remains the correct and most precise selection."
223641000,Slovakia (geographic location),Slovakia (country name),"This entry states Slovakia as a country name, precisely matching Slovakia (geographic location) SCTID 223641000. No additional attributes (e.g., nationality, origin) are included—only the place identification. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. A parent concept would be under-specified, and selecting a child or sibling location would not fit the wording. The parenthetical clarifies the nature of the term without altering the code."
417528008,Consent given for upload to local shared electronic record (finding),Clinician note: consent given for local shared electronic record upload.,"This clinician documentation indicates that consent has been given specifically for uploading to the local shared electronic record, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 417528008 (Clinical finding). It avoids broader sharing or different statuses; hence, parent concepts are too general and sibling concepts like consent declined or consent for national records do not fit. The wording is a straightforward restatement of the concept without adding attributes."
450747009,Saint George's respiratory questionnaire score (observable entity),SGRQ score,"The abbreviation SGRQ is the standard shorthand for Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and 'score' indicates the observable measurement from this instrument. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, corresponding to the data element. The exact concept match is Saint George's respiratory questionnaire score (450747009). More general parent concepts (questionnaire score) are too broad, and child/sibling concepts (total or domain scores) are not specifically described; no extra attributes are introduced."
284478006,Biochemistry interpretation 1 (observable entity),Clinical biochemistry interpretation = 1,"The entry denotes an interpretation value of ‘1’ in clinical biochemistry, which is a standard synonym for biochemistry in lab medicine and maps to Biochemistry interpretation 1 (SCTID 284478006). The main concept is an observable interpretive category; it does not assert normal/abnormal or specific analyte levels. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The synonym ‘clinical biochemistry’ is equivalent and does not introduce new attributes. A generic interpretation observable would be less specific, and a sibling with a different numeric label would be incorrect."
364011007,Incus observable (observable entity),Structured field: incus observable entity,"This entry names a structured data field capturing an observable entity about the incus, fitting SNOMED’s Observable entity category. There is no added result, abnormality, laterality, or procedure. The precise match is SCTID 364011007 Incus observable because the phrasing targets the incus specifically and keeps the property unspecified. Parent-level observables are too general, and child-level specific incus properties would be overly detailed."
313963009,Plasma etiocholanolone measurement (procedure),Plasma etiocholanolone measurement,"The entry states a laboratory procedure measuring the analyte etiocholanolone specifically in the plasma specimen. This precisely matches SNOMED CT 313963009, which is a Procedure. It does not introduce results, timing, or indications; it simply identifies the measurement and specimen. A broader parent such as etiocholanolone measurement without specimen would be less specific, and siblings like serum or urine etiocholanolone measurement would be incorrect because the wording explicitly requires plasma. The phrasing uses “measurement,” which is a standard procedural synonym and does not alter the concept."
405202004,Family integrity (observable entity),Psychosocial note item—family integrity,"This denotes 'family integrity' as a documented psychosocial item, maintaining the core observable property without adding a value or action. It maps to SNOMED CT 405202004 (Observable entity). Alternatives like 'family coping' or 'family cohesion' would represent different attributes and thus are less appropriate."
1373687003,No postoperative disorder (situation),No post-operative complication observed.,"The phrase indicates that observation did not reveal any complication after surgery, signifying no postoperative disorder. The attributes include postoperative context and negation. This maps to a Situation with explicit context, not a Disorder. The entry does not introduce any specific complication subtype, site, or severity, so 'No postoperative disorder' is the most precise SNOMED concept."
1119542004,Moderate constriction of peripheral visual field (finding),HVF: moderate peripheral visual field constriction,"Referencing Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) testing provides context but does not add attributes beyond the core finding: moderate constriction of the peripheral visual field. The concept remains a Clinical finding with severity (moderate) and location (peripheral visual field). SNOMED CT 'Moderate constriction of peripheral visual field' (1119542004) is the exact code. Parent concepts would be underspecified, and siblings that differ in severity or lack peripheral focus would not match."
248197006,Acromegalic facies (finding),Facial profile exam: acromegalic facies,"This wording records acromegalic facies within the context of a facial profile exam, maintaining the finding as-is. It is a Clinical finding and maps to SNOMED CT 248197006. More general or partial-feature concepts are less precise, while the endocrine disorder concept would be incorrect for an appearance finding. The exam context does not add attributes beyond the presence of the facies."
467483002,Cardiac embolectomy/thrombectomy suction system (physical object),Cardiac clot extraction suction system,"This describes a suction-based system for the extraction of clots from the heart. The main concept is a cardiac embolectomy/thrombectomy device system. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. “Extraction” here is a clinically acceptable synonym for removal, and combined with “suction” it reflects the same mechanism as the preferred term. It is not overly broad (it specifies cardiac) nor overly specific (no component details), so it fits the cardiac embolectomy/thrombectomy suction system concept."
223719008,Guyana (geographic location),Guyana,"The entry states the country name 'Guyana' with no additional qualifiers, so the sole concept is the geographic location of Guyana. In SNOMED CT, this falls under the category Qualifier value with the semantic tag 'geographic location'. It precisely matches the country-level concept rather than a parent concept such as 'Geographic location' or 'Country', and it does not indicate any child concept like a city or region within Guyana. No sibling locations (e.g., French Guiana or Suriname) are implied, ensuring this maps exactly to Guyana (geographic location)."
261971003,Serotype NT/R (qualifier value),Serotype designation NT/R,"The entry specifies that the serotype designation is NT/R, which is a discrete value used to qualify the outcome of serotyping. The concept is a Qualifier value; there are no added contextual attributes. This maps best to SNOMED CT 261971003, the specific serotype NT/R value. Parent concepts (generic serotype qualifier) lack specificity, while sibling values indicating only NT or only R would not match the combined NT/R designation stated here."
609271006,Open repair of strangulated femoral hernia with prosthesis (procedure),Open strangulated femoral hernia repair with prosthesis inserted,"The text specifies an open repair of a femoral hernia that is strangulated, with insertion of a prosthesis. Core attributes are approach (open), condition (strangulated femoral hernia), and device use (prosthesis), aligning with the SNOMED CT Procedure concept 609271006. It excludes laparoscopic approach, inguinal hernia, or repairs without prosthesis, thus avoiding parent or sibling concepts. 'Prosthesis inserted' is equivalent to prosthetic mesh placement in hernia repair and remains within the target concept."
114531000,"Salmonella II 6,7:z:z42 (organism)","Confirmed taxonomy: Salmonella II 6,7:z:z42","This entry indicates the confirmed taxonomic identification of the organism as Salmonella II 6,7:z:z42, matching the Organism concept. The term 'confirmed' does not introduce clinical findings or disease; it simply asserts identification certainty. Broader Salmonella taxa (parents) would lose antigenic specificity, and sibling serovars differ in formula. Thus SCTID 114531000 is the precise match for this taxon."
257561002,Further education establishment (environment),Location documented as: further education establishment,"The entry captures location information, specifying that the location is a further education establishment. No timing, severity, or other attributes are included. Category: Environment or geographical location. The explicit environment type aligns with Further education establishment (environment) (257561002). Parent environment categories are too general, and sibling concepts (school, university) would misrepresent the location. No specific child subtype is indicated."
469250000,Lung spatula (physical object),OR supply: lung spatula,"The operating room supply context is incidental; the named object is a lung spatula, mapping to Lung spatula (physical object). The category is Physical object. The entry does not specify procedure, timing, or device characteristics, so child concepts are not implicated. Broader parents like 'spatula' or 'surgical supply' are less precise, and different instrument types (siblings) are not suggested."
224016002,New Brunswick (geographic location),"Geographic location: New Brunswick, Canada","This line specifies a geographic location and names New Brunswick, Canada, identifying the province. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). It aligns with SCTID 224016002 by combining country and provincial designation, preventing misclassification to the U.S. city or other levels. The “Geographic location:” context is a documentation header and does not alter the concept, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate."
421060004,Structure of vertebral column (body structure),Vertebral column structure,"This text explicitly describes the vertebral column as a structure, aligning with the Body structure category in SNOMED CT. The most precise mapping is Structure of vertebral column (SCTID 421060004), as it identifies the overall spinal column without any mention of region, condition, or procedure. Parent classes (e.g., skeletal structure) are too generic, and children like cervical/lumbar spine structures are too specific, while siblings like spinal canal or vertebra are different anatomical entities. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term, preserving exact scope and meaning."
462273007,Animal-skin bed mattress overlay (physical object),Animal-skin bed mattress overlay,"The entry explicitly names an animal-skin bed mattress overlay, identifying a physical object placed atop a bed mattress. No additional attributes such as function, brand, thickness, or specific animal type are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the most precise match is Animal-skin bed mattress overlay (SCTID 462273007). A broader parent like bed mattress overlay would omit the material detail, and siblings or children such as foam/air overlays or specific sheepskin variants are not suggested by this wording."
297750001,Naskapi language (qualifier value),Communication record indicates Naskapi language,"Main concept: a communication record shows the language value Naskapi. The term does not introduce intent, preference, or proficiency; it only identifies the language. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The precise match is Naskapi language (SCTID 297750001). Parent concepts like Language (qualifier value) are overly general; sibling languages would not match. The phrasing is a context-bound mention of the same language value."
242094005,Motor vehicle on road in collision with road-side fixed object (event),Occupational health report: motor vehicle on public road collided with roadside fixed object,"This report specifies a motor vehicle collision on a public road (on-road context) with a fixed object at the roadside. Attributes: motor vehicle, on-road, collision, roadside fixed object. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 242094005 fits best due to the explicit on-road collision with a roadside fixed object. Broader parents lack the object detail; children naming a specific object would be too specific. ‘Public road’ is synonymous with on-road traffic context without altering the event."
411658004,Cicer arietinus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Label on vial: Cicer arietinus diagnostic allergen extract,"The text references the product label specifying Cicer arietinus diagnostic allergen extract, which corresponds directly to SCTID 411658004. The main concept is the labeled diagnostic allergen extract product derived from chickpea. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The labeling context does not introduce additional attributes; it confirms the precise product source and diagnostic purpose, making this specific code more appropriate than generic or therapeutic alternatives."
819020007,Estimated quantity of intake of N-3 fatty acid in 24 hours (observable entity),Estimated omega-3 intake per 24 hours,"The phrase specifies an estimated omega-3 intake per 24 hours, which matches the observable entity for the estimated quantity consumed in that period. The main concept is omega-3 (n−3) fatty acids, and the attribute is the 24-hour timeframe with estimation. Category: Observable entity. It avoids mapping to parent concepts without nutrient specificity and sibling nutrients (omega-6), and does not add interpretation or specific species. ‘Omega-3’ is a clinically equivalent synonym for N-3 fatty acids."
223663009,Denmark (geographic location),Denmark — place designation,"The entry identifies 'Denmark' as a place designation, highlighting the term as a geographic label. The main concept is the country Denmark. SNOMED CT places this within the Location/Geographic location hierarchy, with SCTID 223663009 mapping exactly. The wording does not introduce patient-related or administrative attributes; it merely clarifies that the term is a place. Parent concepts are too general, and no child or sibling places are referenced, ensuring accurate mapping to Denmark."
700221004,Care of elderly service (qualifier value),Receiving service: care of elderly,"Presented in administrative context, this entry names the receiving service as care of elderly, expressing a service-type qualifier without setting or specialty details. It aligns with SNOMED CT 700221004 Care of elderly service (qualifier value). Broader parents would not capture the elderly focus, and more specific children or siblings (e.g., community elderly care, geriatric medicine) would add attributes not stated. Thus, the qualifier value for care of elderly service is the correct mapping."
709096001,Control of hemorrhage of blood vessel of abdomen following vascular surgery (procedure),Control of hemorrhage of abdominal blood vessel following vascular surgery,"The entry explicitly states a procedure to control hemorrhage involving a blood vessel of the abdomen and specifies that it occurred following vascular surgery. The main concept is a procedural intervention for bleeding control at the abdominal vascular site with the postoperative context of prior vascular surgery. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This exactly matches SCTID 709096001, which is defined as control of hemorrhage of blood vessel of abdomen following vascular surgery. More general parent concepts such as 'control of hemorrhage' or 'control of hemorrhage of abdominal blood vessel' would omit the critical 'following vascular surgery' context. Child or sibling concepts that specify a particular vessel (e.g., aorta) or technique are not indicated, and no additional attributes like severity or laterality are introduced."
3865001,Structure of interscapular region of back (body structure),Imaging label: interscapular back region,"An imaging label marking the interscapular region of the back identifies only the anatomical site and adds no findings or modifiers. This fits the Body structure category. More general parent codes would be imprecise, and sibling regions over the scapulae do not match the space between them. SCTID 3865001 is therefore the most precise code."
411792009,Poa pratensis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Poa pratensis diagnostic allergen extract product,"Adding “product” reinforces the SNOMED CT Product nature, while the core remains a diagnostic allergen extract of Poa pratensis, which is exactly concept 411792009. Broader parents, other species siblings, or therapeutic forms are not stated. No additional attributes like route, dose, or concentration are implied, maintaining precise mapping."
703450007,Electrophoresis technique (qualifier value),Electrophoresis technique,"The main concept explicitly names the method as “electrophoresis technique,” which is a methodological qualifier rather than a procedure or result. This aligns with SNOMED CT category Qualifier value and maps directly to SCTID 703450007. It does not introduce analyte, sample type, subtype (e.g., gel or capillary), timing, or outcomes, so no child concept like “Gel electrophoresis technique” or “Capillary electrophoresis technique” is implied. A broader parent such as “Laboratory technique (qualifier value)” would be less precise, and “Electrophoresis (procedure)” would be incorrect because the entry describes the technique as a qualifier, not the performance of a test."
223683005,Wales (geographic location),Cymru (Wales),"The text provides both the Welsh and English names for the same geographic place, reinforcing the single concept of Wales. Category: Qualifier value — geographic location. The appropriate SNOMED CT code is 223683005. The parentheses do not imply any additional attributes. Parent concepts like United Kingdom would be broader and thus less accurate, and no child areas or sibling locations are present in the wording."
399109006,Left ventricular diastolic area (observable entity),Diastolic LV area,"Using 'LV' for left ventricle and 'diastolic area' preserves the same meaning: area of the left ventricle in diastole. This is an Observable entity. It is best coded as SNOMED 399109006, because the phrase clearly indicates the diastolic phase and area property. More general or different-phase siblings (e.g., systolic area) and other properties (volume/dimension) are not implied, keeping this match precise."
363670009,Interphalangeal joint structure of great toe (body structure),"Documented structure: interphalangeal joint, hallux","The phrasing lists the anatomical structure and identifies it as the hallux interphalangeal joint. Category: Body structure. The comma syntax does not add attributes; it strictly denotes the joint. It is a precise match to the great toe IP joint concept, not a parent unspecified toe IP joint nor a sibling like the hallux MTP joint."
396804002,"Specimen from pancreas obtained by pylorus sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy, partial pancreatectomy (specimen)",Pancreas tissue acquired in a pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure (partial pancreatectomy).,The text clearly states the specimen is from the pancreas and that it was obtained during a pylorus-preserving Whipple (PPPD) with partial pancreatectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. ‘Pylorus-preserving Whipple’ is a standard synonym for pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy; thus SCTID 396804002 is the best match. A sibling concept for classic Whipple (non–pylorus-sparing) or a generic partial pancreatectomy without PD would be incorrect. No other attributes are added.
702175005,Enteral feeding pole (physical object),Enteral feeding pole available,"Availability is noted, but the item is the enteral feeding pole. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and SCTID 702175005 applies. The qualifier 'available' is context rather than an attribute of type, dimensions, or function. More general or sibling concepts (e.g., IV pole) are not suitable because the entry specifies the pole intended for enteral feeding."
224661002,Maisonette (environment),Living arrangement: maisonette,This indicates the patient’s living arrangement involves a 'maisonette' dwelling. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It maps directly to 224661002. Selecting 'Apartment' or 'House' would sacrifice specificity; 'Duplex' or 'Townhome' would misclassify the environment. The wording stays focused on the dwelling type without extra attributes.
728826005,Entire sixth cervical spinal cord segment (body structure),Reference anatomy: entire C6 spinal cord segment,"This states the reference anatomy as the full C6 spinal cord segment, using “C6” for sixth cervical. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The inclusion of “entire” requires SCTID 728826005, differentiating it from general segment concepts without the completeness qualifier. Other cervical segments or broader spinal cord structures are excluded. The context is purely anatomical without introducing diagnosis or procedure attributes."
217353007,Fumes from combustion of polyvinylchloride and similar material in conflagration in theater (event),Large theater fire with fumes from polyvinyl chloride combustion and similar materials,"This states a large theater fire (conflagration) with fumes from polyvinyl chloride combustion and similar materials. SNOMED CT category: Event. 'Large theater fire' is a clinically equivalent phrasing for conflagration in theater, and the material attribute is explicitly preserved. It is more specific than parent fire-in-theater concepts and avoids siblings related to different materials or settings. No exposure or clinical effects are implied, keeping it within the event hierarchy."
397253004,Pantascopic angle (observable entity),Pantoscopic angle (eyeglass parameter),"This uses the clinically accepted spelling variant “pantoscopic angle” to denote the same observable parameter; the parenthetical clarifies context without adding attributes. It is still an Observable entity representing the down-tilt angle of the frame/lens. Broader angle concepts would be less specific, and other eyewear geometry observables (e.g., wrap angle) are not equivalent. Thus the pantascopic angle SCTID is appropriate."
61457001,Product containing adrenal hormone (product),Label states: adrenal hormone product,"The essential content here is 'adrenal hormone product,' indicating a product whose active is an adrenal hormone, matching Product containing adrenal hormone (product), SCTID 61457001. The label context does not alter the clinical semantics or add attributes like dose or route. It is more specific than general hormone products and not narrowed to a specific adrenal hormone child concept. Class: Product."
261958001,Multiplanar reconstruction (qualifier value),Multiplanar reconstruction option selected,"The entry shows selection of the multiplanar reconstruction option, still describing the technique itself. Category: Qualifier value. It maps to SCTID 261958001 by specifying MPR without mentioning modality, plane, or body site. Broader reconstruction categories are less specific, and alternate techniques (MIP, VR, CPR) are not invoked, avoiding child/sibling mismatches. The selection context does not alter the technique being coded."
106659001,Superfamily Heligmosomatoidea (organism),Teaching file tag—Heligmosomatoidea (superfamily),"This educational context still references the organism taxon Heligmosomatoidea at the superfamily level, adding no clinical state or detection. The main concept is the organism superfamily. SNOMED CT categorizes this as an Organism, matching SCTID 106659001. The entry does not imply a broader or narrower taxon, making parent/child or sibling concepts inappropriate."
426421005,Correction of stenosis of nasal pyriform aperture (procedure),Pyriform aperture stenosis correction (nasal),"The entry conveys a nasal procedure correcting stenosis of the pyriform aperture. It remains within the Procedure domain and avoids additional qualifiers. This matches SCTID 426421005. Parent concepts would be too general, while sibling concepts addressing other regions of the nasal airway do not fit the anatomical specificity. The word order and parenthetical '(nasal)' do not alter the meaning, maintaining clinical equivalence with the preferred term."
84567002,Specimen obscured by blood (finding),Cytology report: specimen obscured by blood.,"While presented in a cytology reporting context, the content states only that the specimen is obscured by blood, matching the Clinical finding “Specimen obscured by blood” (SCTID 84567002). It does not specify cervical or other specimen types, nor adequacy or extent, keeping it general. Parent concepts would be too broad, and siblings for contamination or unsatisfactory specimens would be less appropriate because obscuration is the sole finding reported."
81234003,Walk-in clinic (environment),Location of care: walk-in clinic,"The entry identifies the location where care occurs as a walk-in clinic, which is an environment designation. It belongs to the Environment or geographical location category. The code Walk-in clinic (environment) 81234003 is the most accurate because the defining feature—walk-in access—is explicit. Parent concepts like Clinic (environment) are too generic, and sibling environments (Urgent care center, Retail clinic) imply models not stated. The phrase adds no additional attributes beyond the environment type."
405062006,Self-control behavior: abuse (observable entity),Self-management of abusive behavior,"The phrase 'self-management' is commonly used interchangeably with 'self-control' in behavioral assessments, reflecting the individual's management of behavior patterns related to abuse. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This matches SCTID 405062006, focusing on assessment rather than a clinical finding. It is more precise than the generic parent and does not imply different attributes that would push it toward sibling domains (e.g., substance-related or aggression-related self-control)."
223700003,Barbados (geographic location),Barbados (national territory),"The entry identifies Barbados and refers to it as a national territory, still indicating the same geographic location. The main concept is the geographic entity Barbados. Within SNOMED CT, this is categorized as a Geographic location, best matched by Barbados (geographic location) SCTID 223700003. The descriptor does not shift the mapping to jurisdictional or administrative sub-entities. No parent regions or child places are specified."
223861009,Great Britain (geographic location),"Region noted: Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales)","This entry uses clarifying text to define Great Britain by listing its constituent countries, keeping the coded concept as the island of Great Britain. It maps to SNOMED CT Location (Geographic location) with SCTID 223861009. United Kingdom would incorrectly add Northern Ireland, British Isles would be broader, and individual child regions (England/Scotland/Wales) would be too narrow."
681221000119108,History of herpes zoster (situation),Previous herpes zoster (history),"The explicit parenthetical ‘history’ ensures the temporal context, and ‘previous’ indicates a past episode of herpes zoster. The concept is a historical occurrence, without attributes like recurrence count, anatomical site, or severity. This maps to SNOMED CT History of herpes zoster (situation) 681221000119108. Coding as the active disorder is not appropriate due to the historical framing. Other history concepts (e.g., history of viral disease) are too broad and would lose specificity to herpes zoster."
42131003,Abnormal menstrual cycle (finding),Atypical menstrual cycle.,"Describing the menstrual cycle as atypical indicates abnormality in the cycle without specifying the subtype, constituting a Clinical finding. This maps to 42131003 Abnormal menstrual cycle. It avoids implying specific children such as irregularity or amenorrhea. “Atypical” here is a clinically safe paraphrase for abnormal and does not introduce new attributes."
716158006,Token Test score (observable entity),Patient mentions their Token Test score,"This patient-reported statement still refers to the Token Test score as the measured outcome of that test, without any interpretation or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The exact concept is 716158006 Token Test score. It does not imply a procedure code, nor an abnormal result, nor a different test. The phrasing is a contextual synonym indicating the same score concept."
365174004,Finding related to ability to perform drawing activities (finding),Finding related to ability to perform drawing activities,"The entry explicitly states a finding concerning the patient's ability to perform drawing activities, matching the scope of the SNOMED CT Clinical finding 'Finding related to ability to perform drawing activities' (SCTID 365174004). No status (able vs unable), severity, cause, timing, or associated conditions are given, so more specific children such as 'Able to perform drawing activities' or 'Unable to perform drawing activities' are not appropriate. Broader or sibling domains like general fine motor skills or writing are not mentioned. The phrasing directly reflects the concept without introducing additional attributes."
362137009,Entire proximal stomach (body structure),Entire proximal gastric portion,"Here, 'gastric' is synonymous with 'stomach,' and the phrase denotes the whole proximal portion. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The specific concept is 'Entire proximal stomach' (SCTID 362137009). Using a broader gastric concept (entire stomach) or a narrower substructure (fundus/cardial region) would be inappropriate. The synonym 'gastric' does not change the anatomical identity; it maintains equivalence and the same code selection."
447321005,Roseomonas ludipueritiae (organism),Final identification: Roseomonas ludipueritiae,"The phrase indicates the conclusive identification of the organism as Roseomonas ludipueritiae. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The best match is the organism concept at the species level (447321005), which captures exactly the entity being named. No infection status, anatomical site, or other attributes are mentioned, so this should not be coded as a clinical finding or disorder. Broader or different species codes would not match the stated species."
702284002,"Non-evacuated blood collection tube, lithium heparin (physical object)",Lithium heparin blood collection tube — non-evacuated,"This clearly indicates a blood collection tube with lithium heparin and the non-evacuated property; it is a Physical object. The combination aligns with SNOMED CT 702284002. Parent categories lacking either attribute are too general, and the evacuated lithium heparin tube sibling is excluded by 'non-evacuated.' The absence of gel, micro size, or cap color avoids steering toward a more specific child device."
428485006,Sickle cell trait suspected (situation),Concern for sickle cell trait,"This entry conveys clinician concern that the patient may have sickle cell trait, which equates to a suspected condition. The main concept is sickle cell trait; the explicit attribute is concern/suspicion. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. A definitive finding code would misrepresent the uncertainty. Sibling concepts such as suspected sickle cell disease or genetic carrier confirmed status are not implied. 'Concern for' is a typical paraphrase of suspected without adding extra attributes."
890129005,Contact with Cactaceae (event),Contact with cactus recorded on intake,"This documentation line captures an intake-recorded contact event with a cactus (Cactaceae). The main concept is contact; the plant family attribute is implicit via 'cactus.' The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 890129005 is the precise match. Broader contact-with-plant codes lack specificity, and any clinical effect codes would be incorrect because none are mentioned. The intake context does not alter the event nature."
40680004,Explosive character (finding),Behavioral profile: explosive character,"A behavioral profile documenting “explosive character” identifies an enduring trait rather than discrete actions or a disorder. This aligns exactly with Explosive character (40680004) in the Clinical finding hierarchy. It does not mention aggression, violence, or frequency of episodes, so behavior-specific siblings or intermittent explosive disorder would not be accurate. More general personality trait findings would be too broad compared to the explicit explosive descriptor."
401014009,Peak expiratory flow rate pre steroids (observable entity),Peak expiratory flow recorded before starting steroids,"This entry indicates the observable (peak expiratory flow) and that it was recorded before initiating steroids. The main concept is measurement timing relative to steroid start. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. It maps to 401014009 because the wording specifies the pre-steroid context; broader observables without timing are less appropriate. The phrase does not specify route, dose, or result value, avoiding unintended child/sibling mappings. The wording is a straightforward paraphrase of the preferred term."
223631003,Samoa (geographic location),Service location: Samoa (country),"This indicates the service location is the country Samoa, which is a Geographic location in the SNOMED CT Location hierarchy. The wording excludes American Samoa and larger regional parents. The service context adds no attributes to the place itself, keeping the appropriate mapping to Samoa (geographic location)."
438666008,Thermodesulfobacterium commune (organism),Listed organism: Thermodesulfobacterium commune,"The entry lists Thermodesulfobacterium commune as an organism, a straightforward taxonomic reference. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The appropriate code is 438666008 for the species. The context of being listed does not introduce clinical attributes like infection or detection status; thus, using any finding or disorder code would be less accurate. Parent genus or broader organism hierarchy would be too general."
399659001,Pleural invasion by tumor indeterminate (finding),Cannot exclude pleural invasion by tumor,"The phrase 'cannot exclude' expresses uncertainty consistent with an indeterminate finding regarding pleural invasion by tumor. This is a Clinical finding, and 399659001 is appropriate because it codifies the indeterminate status rather than a definitive outcome. It should not be coded as 'present' or 'absent' invasion, since neither is concluded. The wording is a standard clinical equivalent for indeterminacy and does not add attributes."
247639006,Clarity of thought (observable entity),Mental status exam - thought clarity,"The text identifies thought clarity as a labeled component of the mental status exam, which corresponds to the observable entity for clarity of thought. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It is the most precise match to SCTID 247639006 since it specifies the clarity attribute of thought only. It does not introduce a rating or outcome, avoiding mapping to findings, and excludes related but different attributes such as coherence or clarity of consciousness."
357421000202109,Use of psilocybin (finding),Use of psilocybin,"This entry mirrors the preferred term and states the exact finding of psilocybin use. It is a Clinical finding and aligns exactly with 'Use of psilocybin (finding)' (357421000202109). There are no added qualifiers such as dependence, intoxication, or historical context. Therefore, parent concepts (e.g., general substance use) or sibling concepts (other hallucinogens or psilocybin misuse) are less appropriate."
705846007,Perineo-gynecological surgical mesh (physical object),Surgical mesh — perineo-gynecological,"The entry describes a surgical mesh qualified by the perineo-gynecological domain, identifying a specific physical object without adding any attributes such as material, brand, clinical indication, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The most accurate code is 705846007, as the qualifier uniquely targets the perineo-gynecological scope; using the parent 'surgical mesh' would be too general and siblings like 'vaginal surgical mesh' or 'urogynecological surgical mesh' would imply details not present. The hyphenated qualifier is a direct, clinically equivalent way to specify the concept."
285357004,Erve virus (organism),Erve virus (taxon),"Labeling the term as a taxon frames it as a biological classification, i.e., the organism concept itself. The SNOMED CT category is Organism and Erve virus (organism), SCTID 285357004, is the exact species-level match. No attributes of presence, infection, or testing are present, so using clinical finding or situation codes would be incorrect. Higher-level taxa such as Orthobunyavirus are too general, and no strain or variant is specified, precluding more granular child concepts."
261885007,LSU 1945 (qualifier value),Patient-stated value: LSU 1945,"The text presents LSU 1945 as a patient-stated coded value, not adding any clinical attributes beyond the discrete qualifier itself. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 261885007 is the specific match. Parents are too general and siblings (e.g., LSU 1940) are different values. The context of who stated it does not alter the concept represented."
226456006,Nuts and seeds intake (observable entity),Nut and seed consumption,"The term 'consumption' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'intake' in nutritional observables, and 'nut and seed' reflects the combined group. As an Observable entity, this maps to SCTID 226456006. A parent category of food consumption would be overly general, and separate nut-only or seed-only concepts would not capture the combined scope stated. There are no added attributes such as frequency or adequacy; it remains a neutral statement of the intake variable."
119389009,Specimen from throat (specimen),Source of specimen is throat,"The entry declares the anatomical origin of the specimen as the throat, with no technique or subtype. It fits Specimen from throat (specimen) SCTID 119389009 in the Specimen hierarchy. Parent concepts lack site specificity, and child/sibling concepts naming swab, biopsy, or pharyngeal/oropharyngeal sites are not supported by the text. The phrasing is a standard way to denote specimen site without altering the core concept."
242022004,Asphyxia by entrapment with mouth and nose blocked (event),Case summary: asphyxiation from entrapment occluding mouth and nose,"The case summary states asphyxiation resulting from entrapment that occluded the mouth and nose. Category: Event. “Asphyxiation” and “occluding” are clinically equivalent to asphyxia and blocking, preserving semantics. This uniquely matches SCTID 242022004 and is not better represented by general asphyxia or other specific events like strangulation or choking."
245398005,Entire cystic duct (body structure),Preoperative plan references the entire cystic duct,"The planning note identifies the entire cystic duct as the anatomical structure of interest. This is a Body structure concept, and SCTID 245398005 best fits because it encodes the whole structure. A parent cystic duct code would not guarantee the full extent, and no child or sibling structures are mentioned. The planning context does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
1340095005,Entire extrahepatic segment of right hepatic duct (body structure),Entire outside-the-liver segment of the right hepatic duct,"'Outside-the-liver' is a lay equivalent of 'extrahepatic,' and 'entire' confirms the whole segment is included. Attributes are right laterality, extrahepatic position, and full segment extent. This is an anatomical Body structure and matches SCTID 1340095005. Parents like 'Right hepatic duct' or 'Hepatic duct structure' are broader; siblings such as left-sided structures or intrahepatic segments are incorrect. The paraphrase remains semantically aligned with the extrahepatic segment without introducing clinical events or modifiers."
281037003,Child health observations (finding),Child health observations documented,"The core finding remains child health observations; “documented” reflects recording in the chart without changing the clinical concept or shifting to a procedure. This maps to SNOMED CT 281037003 (Clinical finding). A code for documentation/review procedures would be less appropriate because the entry’s focus is the presence of child health observations, not the act of documentation. More specific pediatric observation types are not stated, so the general child health observations concept is the precise match."
52376002,Eryx johni (organism),Documented as John’s sand boa (Eryx johnii),"The entry pairs the common name with the scientific synonym, both referring to the same species. The concept type is Organism. The documentation context does not add clinical attributes; it only specifies the organism. Parent concepts like genus Eryx are too broad, and siblings do not match, so SCTID 52376002 is appropriate."
216425002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, hospital (environment)",Accident/poisoning occurred in hospital.,"This statement identifies the hospital as the setting in which an accident or poisoning took place and does not introduce any additional attributes (e.g., mechanism of injury, timing, or severity). The most accurate SNOMED CT match is 216425002 (Environment or geographical location), specifying hospital as the place of occurrence. Using a more general parent like place of occurrence of accident or poisoning would be less precise, and siblings such as home, street, or school do not match the wording. The phrase is a direct, clinically equivalent paraphrase that maintains the intended location granularity."
16675431000119101,Ultrasonography of bilateral kidneys abnormal (finding),Follow-up note: bilateral renal sonogram abnormal.,"Main concept: follow-up documentation noting abnormal sonogram findings of both kidneys. Attributes: modality (sonogram/ultrasound), anatomy (renal/kidneys), laterality (bilateral), and result (abnormal). SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. This is best coded as Ultrasonography of bilateral kidneys abnormal (SCTID 16675431000119101). The follow-up context does not add timing severity; it simply frames documentation. Unilateral, non-ultrasound, or broader renal tract concepts would be incorrect given the phrasing."
421646000,Nunavut (geographic location),Facility catchment: Nunavut,"The concept is Nunavut; the attribute is catchment area, situating the facility’s service area without changing the location entity. Category: Geographic location. Nunavut (geographic location) SCTID 421646000 precisely represents the territory referenced. Broader locations like Canada or different territorial siblings do not fit the wording. No subdivision within Nunavut is indicated, so the territory-level concept is appropriate."
161496006,History of chronic ear infection (situation),Follow-up visit: history of chronic ear infection acknowledged,"This statement during a follow-up visit confirms the presence of a past medical history of chronic ear infection. It conveys historical context and chronicity without current illness or subtype details. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context category. The correct code is 161496006 | History of chronic ear infection (situation). A disorder code would misstate the context as active. Choosing a parent history concept would omit the chronic attribute, and selecting a child concept for specific otitis subtypes would add specificity not present in the wording."
45311000087101,Aortic valve ventriculoarterial mean gradient (observable entity),Mean gradient across the aortic valve,"This phrase clearly denotes the mean transvalvular pressure gradient across the aortic valve, which corresponds to the ventriculoarterial mean gradient. As a parameter being observed or measured, the SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The exact concept match is 'Aortic valve ventriculoarterial mean gradient' (SCTID 45311000087101), because it captures the mean gradient across the AV without implying peak, instantaneous, or peak-to-peak values. Broader parent concepts like 'aortic valve gradient' are less precise, and sibling concepts for peak gradient or LVOT gradients do not fit the 'mean' attribute or the specified valve. The synonym retains the same meaning without introducing method, timing, severity, or associated conditions."
223961008,Islay (geographic location),Location: Islay,"“Location: Islay” is a documentation-style line that names the place without adding extra attributes beyond the location label, mapping to Islay (geographic location), SCTID 223961008. Category: Location (Geographic location). The context header “Location” clarifies the category and does not shift meaning to parent (generic island) or to any child place (towns within Islay). The most precise match remains the Islay geographic location concept."
58502006,Product containing propylamine derivative and histamine receptor antagonist (product),Start product containing propylamine derivative and histamine receptor antagonist,"Initiation of therapy is documented for a product containing both a propylamine derivative and a histamine receptor antagonist. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The entry matches SCTID 58502006 because it requires both classes in one product while omitting dose, form, and subtype details. Parent concepts involving only one class are inadequate, and sibling concepts focusing on receptor subtype would be overly specific compared to the wording."
284650002,Military camp (environment),Location recorded: military camp,"The recorded location is a military camp, an environmental designation. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. No extra attributes like activity, exposure, or timing are given, and it does not imply other facility types such as bases or barracks, so Military camp (environment) is the appropriate code."
224890005,Hospital reception area (environment),Hospital reception area,"The phrase explicitly names the environment as the hospital reception area, matching the SNOMED CT fully specified name “Hospital reception area (environment).” The main concept is a physical environment/location within a hospital, with no added attributes. Category: Environment or geographical location. This is the most precise code because it identifies the specific area in a hospital used for reception. A parent like “Hospital (environment)” is too broad, and siblings such as “Hospital waiting area” or “Clinic reception area” are incorrect because they refer to different spaces or facility types. No synonym variation is used here; it is a direct match."
223932007,Border region (geographic location),Place: border region,"This entry identifies the place as a border region, meaning an area near a territorial or administrative boundary. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. Code 223932007 accurately represents a regional area along a border. Parent concepts such as Geographic location are overly broad, and siblings like coastal place describe different kinds of regions. Concepts representing lines or points (boundary line, crossing) do not match the regional nature indicated here."
3391000181104,Normal gene product function (qualifier value),Normal function of gene product,"The phrase expresses normality of the function of a gene product and nothing else. It fits the Qualifier value category since it provides an interpretive quality applied to gene product function. The best match is SCTID 3391000181104, which exactly represents normal gene product function. Broader qualifiers like “Normal” do not specify the functional domain, and siblings like “Abnormal gene product function” are contradicted by the term. The reordering of words is a clinical synonym that maintains identical meaning."
462662009,"Insulin syringe, fixed-needle (physical object)",Device note: insulin syringe with fixed needle,"A device documentation entry specifying an insulin syringe with a fixed needle. Physical object category. This maps directly to SCTID 462662009, and does not suggest alternate attributes (size, safety) that would shift coding to related concepts. Parent concepts lack the fixed-needle detail."
70871000119100,History of irritable bowel syndrome (situation),Intake form: history of IBS.,"An intake form entry stating ‘history of IBS’ unambiguously frames the condition as part of past medical history rather than an active problem. The main concept is IBS with historical context. SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and History of irritable bowel syndrome is the most accurate mapping. The abbreviation IBS is a standard synonym. Disorder-level IBS or broader history concepts would be less precise."
313133004,Finding of finger (finding),Finger finding identified on assessment,"The entry records that an assessment identified a finding involving the finger, without details about type or severity. Category: Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 313133004 'Finding of finger' is most appropriate, focusing on finger as the site of the finding. It is not a procedure concept (the assessment is context), and it does not justify selection of specific child diagnoses. Parents would be too general and fail to capture the finger-focused nature."
223607008,Islamic Republic of Iran (geographic location),Country: Islamic Republic of Iran,"This entry provides the official name of the country, staying strictly within the national geographic location concept and mapping to SNOMED CT 223607008. The 'Country:' label is a contextual type indicator and does not add attributes like residence or travel. Parent concepts such as Country are too general, and child/sibling entities (e.g., specific Iranian regions or other countries) would not match the specified nation."
311762001,Mainstream school (environment),Mainstream school (environment),"This phrasing explicitly includes the environment context, clearly identifying the concept as the mainstream school environment. The main medical concept is an environment: mainstream school. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. Code 311762001 is exact because it represents the mainstream school as an environmental setting. Using the parent ‘School (environment)’ would be less specific, and using a sibling like ‘Special school (environment)’ would be incorrect. No extra attributes are implied beyond the environment type."
447601001,Genus Diopsittaca (organism),Taxon: Diopsittaca genus,"The statement explicitly indicates that the taxon is the genus Diopsittaca. This is an Organism concept in SNOMED CT at the genus rank. No species or other taxonomic ranks are given. Thus, Genus Diopsittaca (447601001) is the exact match. A parent (e.g., family Psittacidae) or sibling genus would not be appropriate, and a child species is not indicated by the text."
275544003,History of heart disorder (situation),Hx of cardiac disorder,"The abbreviation 'Hx' denotes history, placing the cardiac disorder in the past and matching a situation with explicit context. 'Cardiac disorder' is synonymous with heart disorder. No subtype or extra attributes are introduced, and it is neither a family history nor a current disorder. Therefore, 'History of heart disorder (situation)' SCTID 275544003 is the exact match."
136112008,Product containing interferon beta (product),Supply product: interferon beta medicinal product,"This entry identifies a supply item in the sense of a medicinal product whose active ingredient is interferon beta, keeping the focus on the product entity. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 136112008 is the precise match because it specifies interferon beta generically, without subtype (beta‑1a/b), pegylation, dose, route, or brand. Parent concepts lacking the beta qualifier are too general, and child concepts are too narrow for the given wording. The supply context does not change the underlying clinical concept, which remains a medicinal product containing interferon beta."
328301002,Glycogen storage disease food (product),Provide glycogen storage disease food on discharge,"This statement directs provision of a glycogen storage disease food product at discharge, pointing to 'Glycogen storage disease food (product)' SCTID 328301002. The main concept is the product; the discharge timing is contextual and does not modify product attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It avoids misclassification to a procedure or care plan because the explicit item is the disease-specific food, not a generic medical food parent or unrelated condition-specific sibling products."
223381003,Hierro (geographic location),Imaging location: Hierro,This provides diagnostic report context while naming Hierro as the imaging location. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). The entry maps to 223381003 |Hierro (geographic location)| because the core concept is the place. 'Imaging location' is contextual and does not create a different clinical finding; parents or siblings are not indicated. The place name remains uniquely identifiable.
39350007,Private physicians' group office (environment),Care site documented as a private physician group practice office,"This identifies the care site as a privately owned office for a physician group practice, directly mapping to SNOMED CT 39350007 within the Environment hierarchy. Generic physician office concepts are too broad without ownership/group qualifiers, and alternative settings (public clinics, hospital outpatient clinics) are inaccurate. The synonyms used ('physician' vs 'doctor', 'group practice office') are clinically equivalent and do not introduce new attributes."
223694009,Honduras (geographic location),República de Honduras,"This is the Spanish official name for the country Honduras, a direct synonym for the same geographic entity. The concept is a Geographic location in the Location hierarchy and is most precisely coded with SCTID 223694009. The language change does not alter semantics or introduce attributes, and no parent region or child locality is indicated."
25721000087108,Emergency shelter (environment),Residing in an emergency shelter,"This documentation describes the environment where the individual is staying, namely an emergency shelter, without adding population or event qualifiers. The main concept is the environmental location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The wording does not introduce attributes that would move the code toward “Homeless shelter” or “Temporary housing”; it simply indicates the emergency shelter environment. Parent “Shelter” is too broad, and adding disaster or evacuation qualifiers would lead to a different concept, so 25721000087108 is the most precise match."
104857000,Pepsinogen II measurement (procedure),Pepsinogen II evaluation (lab),"“Evaluation (lab)” indicates a laboratory procedure measuring pepsinogen II, placing it in the Procedure hierarchy. The synonym “evaluation” here is used to mean laboratory measurement and does not add attributes or results. It matches SCTID 104857000 more precisely than parent concepts and avoids siblings like pepsinogen I or ratio measurements."
224006005,St. John (geographic location),Documented location value: St John,"This presents “St John” as a documented location value, directly pointing to the named geographic place. The main concept is the location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The lack of jurisdiction or feature-type details supports coding to St. John (geographic location). A generic parent would lose specificity, and any particular child concept for a specific St. John would be unfounded."
442820009,Streptococcus pyogenes type emm91 (organism),Organism taxonomy entry: Streptococcus pyogenes emm91,"This taxonomic style entry identifies Streptococcus pyogenes and its emm subtype 91, aligning with Streptococcus pyogenes type emm91 (organism), SCTID 442820009. The only attribute stated is the emm typing. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The taxonomy context does not add clinical attributes. The parent organism lacks the subtype, and different emm-number siblings are excluded by the explicit 'emm91'."
16093761000119102,History of facial palsy (situation),Has a history of facial paralysis,"This statement clearly identifies a prior occurrence of facial paralysis, synonymous with facial palsy, without implying current deficits. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The precise match is History of facial palsy, as it references the disorder in a historical context and avoids adding cause, side, severity, or recurrence. Parent situations are too general, and sibling concepts specifying types (e.g., Bell’s palsy) would introduce etiologic specificity not present. The synonym ‘facial paralysis’ maintains equivalence to ‘facial palsy’."
728418007,Entire midline of hard palate (body structure),Whole midline of the hard palate,The wording 'whole midline' is a clinically safe synonym for 'entire midline' and clearly confines the anatomy to the hard palate midline over its full extent. This is a Body structure concept and matches SCTID 728418007. It is more specific than general hard palate anatomy and does not stray into sibling anatomical entities such as sutures or mucosal features. The use of 'whole' does not alter the code selection; it preserves the same anatomical scope as 'entire.'
415683005,Fetal complete trisomy 21 syndrome suspected (situation),Patient statement: baby might have complete trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) — suspected,"In a patient-reported context, “might have” expresses suspicion, and “baby” in prenatal care denotes the fetus. The entry explicitly includes “complete trisomy 21,” with “Down syndrome” as a clinically equivalent synonym for trisomy 21 syndrome. The main concept is suspected fetal complete trisomy 21. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 415683005 is the precise code, as it captures suspected status in a fetus for the complete variant. A confirmed disorder code would not match the uncertainty, and variants like mosaic/translocation are not introduced by this wording."
198813007,Entire primitive pulmonary artery (body structure),Patient statement: they mentioned the entire primitive pulmonary artery,"Even in patient-reported context, the term cited is the entire primitive pulmonary artery. This is an anatomical Body structure and aligns with SCTID 198813007. Concepts for partial structures, branches, or the generic pulmonary artery are ruled out by the explicit ‘entire’ reference."
236977006,"Forceps delivery, face to pubes (procedure)",Perinatal record: face-to-pubes forceps extraction,"The phrase indicates a delivery conducted via forceps extraction and specifies the face-to-pubes orientation. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 236977006 is the exact code since it combines forceps use and the face-to-pubes delivery descriptor. A parent term for forceps extraction alone is less specific; a sibling for face-to-pubes delivery without forceps would be incorrect. ""Forceps extraction"" is an accepted synonym for forceps delivery in obstetrics."
264159006,Posterior wall (qualifier value),Posterior wall,"The entry states the anatomical qualifier “posterior wall,” which is the exact phrasing of SNOMED CT 264159006. The main concept is a location descriptor referring to the wall at the posterior aspect, with no organ, condition, laterality, severity, or timing implied. Category: Qualifier value. This matches the precise qualifier used to tag the site of a structure or finding without adding attributes. A parent like “wall (qualifier)” or “posterior (qualifier)” would be less specific, and children or siblings such as “anterior wall” or organ-specific posterior wall structures would be too narrow or inappropriate. The wording is a direct equivalent and does not change code selection."
394759007,Independent provider site (environment),Independent provider facility,"The entry uses “facility” as a synonymous expression of the environment and qualifies it as an independent provider facility. Category: Environment. It maps to SNOMED CT 394759007 because it clearly denotes a care environment independent of institutional ownership and avoids specifying role (e.g., physician) or specialty. Parent concepts like generic provider sites lack the independence detail, and siblings such as hospital outpatient facilities introduce attributes not present. “Facility” is a common equivalent term for the site and does not change code selection."
224026009,District of Newfoundland province (geographic location),Referral destination is a district within Newfoundland province,"While it mentions a referral context, the destination is a geographic location: a district within Newfoundland province. This maps directly to SNOMED CT 224026009 in the Geographic location hierarchy. Using the province concept would be too broad (parent), and specifying a named district would be too specific (child). It does not suggest any other province (sibling). The paraphrase 'district within Newfoundland province' is a clinically equivalent synonym."
107578002,Family Crassulaceae (organism),Crassulaceae,"The entry names the taxonomic plant family Crassulaceae without additional qualifiers. The main concept is the organism classification at family level. In SNOMED CT this corresponds to an Organism and maps precisely to Family Crassulaceae (organism), SCTID 107578002. Broader parents such as general plant families or higher taxa would be too nonspecific, and narrower children like specific genera (e.g., Sedum, Kalanchoe, Crassula) are not referenced. No exposure, allergy, or diagnostic attributes are introduced, so the organism concept at the family level is the most accurate code."
267281000,Entire mesenteric border of small intestine (body structure),Specimen label: entire mesenteric border of small intestine,The entry labels the anatomical structure represented in a specimen as the entire mesenteric border of the small intestine. The concept is a Body structure and corresponds to SCTID 267281000. Mentioning 'specimen label' is contextual and does not change the anatomical target. Parent concepts without 'entire' and sibling concepts such as anti-mesenteric borders or segment-specific borders would be less precise given the wording.
32074000,Long term care hospital (environment),Hospital setting: long-term care,"The phrase identifies a hospital setting and specifies that it is for long-term care, which corresponds to a long-term care hospital environment. This maps to SCTID 32074000 under Environment or geographical location. It is not a general hospital environment nor a non-hospital long-term care facility, and it does not introduce admission or residence attributes."
38711000284107,Navy blue color (qualifier value),Navy blue color,"The entry explicitly names the color as navy blue, which is a specific shade designation and matches the SNOMED CT concept 'Navy blue color (qualifier value)'. The main concept is a color qualifier, with no additional attributes such as severity or causation. As a Qualifier value, this is used to specify the precise color. Choosing this concept is more accurate than a parent like 'Blue color', and avoids siblings such as 'Royal blue' or 'Dark blue', which are different shades. The wording is exact and does not introduce any other clinical entities."
124361000119101,History of malignant neoplasm of fallopian tube (situation),Prior fallopian tube cancer (history),"The parenthetical explicitly clarifies that this is a historical condition, and “fallopian tube cancer” equates to malignant neoplasm at that site. The central concept is a personal past history of malignant neoplasm of the fallopian tube. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation concept. SCTID 124361000119101 is exact because it captures both the site and malignant nature within a history context. Broader parent histories are less specific, and child/sibling concepts with added qualifiers (such as laterality or histology) are not present. The synonym used does not change the intended code."
257664000,Private club (environment),Social setting recorded: private club,"The phrase records the social setting as a private club, which still conveys the environment type without additional clinical attributes. Main concept: environment/social venue. Category: Environment or geographical location. The correct mapping is 257664000 Private club (environment) because the word 'private' denotes membership restriction. It does not imply specific subtypes like 'nightclub' or 'sports club.' The 'social setting' label adds context but does not alter the underlying environment concept."
223805003,Longford (geographic location),Location: Longford,"This is a contextual label followed by the place name, but the coded entity remains the geographic location Longford; no jurisdiction or type is added. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The precise concept is Longford (geographic location) SCTID 223805003, since the text names the place unmodified. Using a parent like Geographic location would omit the specific place, and child concepts that specify country or administrative subdivision would add information not present. The label “Location:” is contextual formatting and does not alter the semantic target."
420941001,Tennessee (geographic location),Jurisdiction: Tennessee,"The entry presents Tennessee as a jurisdiction, which aligns with its role as a U.S. state and geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Location. The correct code is Tennessee (geographic location) SCTID 420941001. Referring to jurisdiction clarifies the administrative level without introducing different attributes. Parent concepts like the nation or child concepts like municipalities are not indicated, keeping the mapping specific to the state."
728175008,Entire tendon of abductor digiti minimi (body structure),Entirety of the abductor digiti minimi tendon,"The main concept is the abductor digiti minimi tendon, with “entirety” clearly indicating the complete tendon. The category is Body structure. This matches SNOMED CT 728175008 because it represents the full anatomical structure without laterality, limb, or subcomponent details. Parent concepts without the completeness qualifier and child/sibling concepts specifying limb or segments are not supported by the wording."
1269115006,Histologic type of neoplasm in peritoneal fluid specimen by cytology technique (observable entity),Specimen: peritoneal fluid; Test: neoplasm histologic type (cytology),"The entry provides a structured specimen (peritoneal fluid) and test (neoplasm histologic type) with the technique specified as cytology. It represents an observable entity designating what is classified, in what specimen, and by which method. SCTID 1269115006 aligns exactly; a parent observable without constraints or a sibling test like 'peritoneal fluid cytology' without histologic typing would not match. 'Histologic type' is the target, and adding '(cytology)' ensures the technique requirement is met."
122251002,Bordetella culture (procedure),Bordetella culture,"The main concept is a laboratory culture specific to the Bordetella genus. This is a Procedure in SNOMED CT. The wording explicitly names “culture,” which distinguishes it from other test modalities like PCR or antigen detection, and it does not specify species or specimen, aligning precisely with SCTID 122251002 (Bordetella culture). Broader parents such as “Culture” or “Bacterial culture” are too generic, and children like “Bordetella pertussis culture” are more specific than stated."
215765008,"Localized fire in watercraft, swimmer injured (event)","Localized fire in watercraft, swimmer injured","The entry explicitly states a localized fire occurring in a watercraft and that a swimmer was injured, matching the two essential elements of SCTID 215765008. This falls under the SNOMED CT category Event. It is the most precise match because it neither generalizes to broader fire or watercraft events nor introduces details that would point to a child concept (e.g., specific watercraft type) or a sibling (e.g., conflagration instead of localized fire). The wording mirrors the preferred term, ensuring exact code selection."
31707003,Zinc bacitracin (substance),Contains: bacitracin zinc,"This indicates the presence of bacitracin zinc, referencing the substance by name only. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It best maps to SCTID 31707003, the zinc salt of bacitracin, and does not imply a particular product or dosage form. Broader antibacterial substance categories are not specific, and bacitracin without zinc would be a different substance. Thus, the zinc bacitracin substance concept is the precise match."
165016006,Lung function testing done (situation),Confirmed: lung function testing done,"This entry affirms that lung function testing is done, focusing on completion without additional attributes. Main concept: lung function testing with done status. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 165016006 is the exact match because it represents lung function testing done. The procedure code would not capture the explicit confirmation of completion. Broad situation codes are too general; specific modality-based situation codes are inappropriate since no modality is named. ‘Confirmed’ expresses certainty but does not alter the coded concept."
309137003,Testes biopsy specimen (specimen),Biopsy specimen from testes,"The phrase describes a specimen derived from biopsy of the testes, precisely fitting “Testes biopsy specimen (specimen)” SCTID 309137003. The main concept is a specimen; attributes include anatomical source (testes) and collection method (biopsy). The SNOMED category is Specimen. This is preferable over a parent like “Biopsy specimen” because it specifies the site, and it avoids siblings such as “Testes excision specimen,” which indicates removal rather than biopsy. The wording doesn’t add timing, laterality, or diagnostic results, ensuring it remains uniquely codable to the given concept."
732124008,Entire intrahepatic vein (body structure),Imaging report term: intrahepatic vein,"As an imaging report term, 'intrahepatic vein' still denotes the anatomical vessel within the liver as a whole. Category: Body structure. This maps to 732124008 (Entire intrahepatic vein), since it avoids branch-level detail or portal system references. The context does not add state or condition, maintaining a purely anatomical designation."
223688001,United States of America (geographic location),U.S. (country),"The abbreviation “U.S.” qualified by “(country)” unambiguously identifies the United States of America as a geographic location. Within SNOMED CT, this maps to the Geographic location category, with SCTID 223688001 as the precise country-level concept. The entry does not introduce extra attributes such as residence or travel. Using a parent concept (e.g., “Country”) would be too broad, and using a child concept (e.g., “New York”) would be too narrow. Sibling countries do not match the stated nation."
414340004,Ghrelin (substance),Follow-up note: ghrelin reviewed.,"This entry frames a follow-up context but only names ghrelin, without stating results, levels, or physiological effects. The main concept is the ghrelin molecule. SNOMED CT category: Substance. Ghrelin (substance) SCTID 414340004 fits best because the specific substance is referenced. Parents like Hormone (substance) are too broad, and siblings/children such as acyl ghrelin or ghrelin receptor are not specified. There is no test or finding, so procedure or clinical finding codes would be inappropriate."
767705002,Facial prosthesis implant attachment (physical object),Facial prosthesis implant attachment hardware,"Describing the item as 'hardware' preserves the meaning that this is a physical attachment piece associated with a facial prosthesis implant. The main concept is the attachment hardware linking a facial prosthesis to its implant. No functional subtype, material, or site is implied. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 767705002 is the most accurate code since it is the facial prosthesis implant attachment. Parent concepts such as generic implant hardware or attachment hardware do not capture the facial prosthesis context, and children specifying facial subsites are not warranted by the wording."
309982000,Upper gastrointestinal surgery department (environment),Upper GI surgery department listed as service area,"Here, the department is labeled as a service area, but the term “department” remains central, preserving the environmental concept. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The specific focus on upper GI surgery prevents mapping to general or GI-wide surgical departments. No procedural or temporal attributes are present, making 309982000 the correct code."
242272008,Accidental exposure to blacking (event),Exposure event recorded: accidental exposure to blacking,"This indicates that the exposure event is documented, specifically accidental exposure to blacking. No other attributes are introduced. Category: Event. The wording remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term, so SCTID 242272008 is correct. Parent or sibling concepts missing either the substance specification or the accidental qualifier are not as accurate."
444370002,Exposure to Human poliovirus (event),Care plan: exposure to human poliovirus,"This care plan entry records exposure to human poliovirus, without adding treatment details or timing attributes. It denotes an Event in SNOMED CT. The wording mirrors the preferred concept, matching SCTID 444370002. Alternatives that generalize the agent or substitute disease names (poliomyelitis) would be less accurate for an exposure-only statement."
702287009,"Non-evacuated blood collection tube, potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride (physical object)",Restocked non-evacuated blood collection tube (potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride).,"This restocking statement still identifies the same physical object: a non-evacuated blood collection tube with potassium oxalate and sodium fluoride. In SNOMED CT, this is a Physical object and matches SCTID 702287009. The context of restocking does not add attributes; it distinguishes the device from generic parent tubes and from siblings such as evacuated variants or tubes with different chemical additives."
234872004,Adjust orthodontic screw (procedure),Orthodontist adjusted the orthodontic screw,"The entry describes an adjustment to an orthodontic screw and includes only provider context, which does not change the coded concept. This is a Procedure. SCTID 234872004 is the appropriate code because the action is an adjustment of the specified device. Parent concepts (e.g., orthodontic appliance procedure) are less specific, and sibling concepts (e.g., adjust orthodontic bracket) or child concepts involving different actions are not supported by the wording."
473347009,Eating disorder examination questionnaire weight concern subscale score (observable entity),EDE-Q Weight Concern scale score,"Here 'scale' stands in for 'subscale,' a clinically accepted synonym within questionnaires, indicating the observable score for the Weight Concern component of the EDE-Q. This accurately maps to SNOMED CT 473347009 as it specifies both the instrument and the subscale’s score. A parent concept would be the EDE-Q overall score, which is less specific, and sibling concepts would refer to other subscale scores. The synonym does not add attributes like severity or timing; it remains the same concept."
854009,Hybognathus argyritis (organism),Taxon noted: Hybognathus argyritis,"This entry references a taxon and names Hybognathus argyritis, clearly indicating the organism at the species level. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The contextual phrase “Taxon noted” does not add clinical attributes or findings; it simply frames the organism term. Thus, the correct code is the species concept Hybognathus argyritis (SCTID 854009). Parent taxa (genus Hybognathus or higher) would be too general, and sibling species would be incorrect."
702890007,Neuropsychology clinic (environment),Neuropsychology clinic,"The entry explicitly names a clinic whose specialty is neuropsychology, identifying a care environment/location rather than a service or procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This matches SCTID 702890007 exactly because it denotes the clinic setting for neuropsychology. Broader parents like Clinic (environment) are too generic, and siblings such as Neurology clinic or Psychology clinic do not match the neuropsychology specialty stated. No additional attributes (e.g., inpatient/outpatient qualifiers) are introduced."
117177007,Sulfonyluric hypoglycemic (substance),Antihyperglycemic sulfonylurea substance,"“Antihyperglycemic” is a clinically accepted synonym for “hypoglycemic,” and combined with “sulfonylurea” it points to the same substance class. The entry avoids patient care attributes and remains in the Substance domain. Parent concepts that are role-only or broad (e.g., general antihyperglycemics) are less specific, while named children (e.g., tolazamide) are too narrow. This makes SCTID 117177007 the appropriate selection."
702893009,Occupational therapy clinic (environment),OT clinic,"This uses the common clinical abbreviation 'OT' for occupational therapy to denote the clinic setting, preserving the same meaning as 'occupational therapy clinic' without adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the precise match is Occupational therapy clinic (environment) SCTID 702893009. More general concepts like Clinic (environment) would lose modality specificity, and other therapy clinic siblings would be incorrect. The abbreviation does not imply services, procedures, or timing—only the environment."
433636003,Percutaneous transluminal cutting balloon angioplasty of axillary artery using fluoroscopic guidance with contrast (procedure),Endovascular cutting balloon angioplasty of the axillary artery under contrast fluoroscopy.,"This describes an endovascular (i.e., percutaneous transluminal) cutting balloon angioplasty at the axillary artery with contrast-enhanced fluoroscopic guidance, which aligns directly to SCTID 433636003. The category is Procedure. The synonym “endovascular” is clinically equivalent to percutaneous transluminal and does not change code selection; “contrast fluoroscopy” restates fluoroscopic guidance with contrast. Broader angioplasty concepts or those lacking cutting balloon specification would be less precise, and sibling procedures affecting other arteries or using different devices would not fit."
5896008,Hellebrin (substance),Ingredient name—hellebrin,"This entry presents hellebrin explicitly as an ingredient name, mapping directly to Hellebrin (substance), SCTID 5896008. There is no reference to dosing, exposure, or product details—only the substance identity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Parent concepts involving ingredient classes or product compositions are too broad, and siblings naming other ingredients would be incorrect. “Ingredient name” is a role-based synonym that preserves the exact substance concept."
26173001,Bifidobacterium choerinum (organism),Organism listing—Bifidobacterium choerinum,"This entry lists Bifidobacterium choerinum as an organism and does not add any detection, strain, or disease attributes. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Organism, with SCTID 26173001 representing the exact species. Choosing a parent genus concept would be less specific, and other species within Bifidobacterium would be incorrect. The list context does not change the underlying taxonomy-based concept."
467286008,Cochlear implant system coil cable (physical object),Cochlear implant coil connector cable,"This entry expresses the coil cable by using the common device nomenclature 'connector cable' for the coil within a CI system. It adds no attributes of condition or laterality. The SNOMED category is Physical object. It maps to 467286008 because it is specifically the coil cable. Generic connector cables (parent) are too broad, and siblings like processor cables or the coil itself are different components. 'Connector cable' here is a clinically equivalent description that does not change the coded concept."
223856007,Islands of France (geographic location),Birthplace field: Islands of France,"The phrase denotes a birthplace field containing the geographic location 'Islands of France.' The core concept to code is the place, a Location (Geographic location). The context 'birthplace field' does not change the target concept or add causal/severity attributes. Coding 'France' would be too general, and coding a specific island would be too narrow. SCTID 223856007 accurately represents the stated location."
252417001,24 Hour electrocardiogram (procedure),24 hr electrocardiogram,"This is a direct synonym with abbreviated time notation, still describing the same procedure: an ECG performed continuously for 24 hours. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The 24-hour duration and electrocardiogram are clearly specified, fitting SCTID 252417001. It does not imply a different setting or method; it avoids broader parent concepts like ECG unspecified duration and excludes siblings such as event recorder or telemetry."
25879008,Entire ascending palatine artery (body structure),Ascending palatine artery observed,"Main concept: ascending palatine artery, with observation context only. No attributes beyond recognition are present. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The named structure corresponds to ‘Entire ascending palatine artery’ (25879008). Parents like generic arteries and siblings like the descending palatine artery are not as precise, and child concepts (specific branches/segments) are not implied."
248092002,Eroticism (observable entity),Eroticism item (assessment),"The entry indicates an assessment item pertaining to eroticism, referencing the observable construct without introducing measurement values or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It corresponds to SCTID 248092002, reflecting the assessed attribute of eroticism rather than a clinical finding like arousal or a diagnostic category. Parent observable entities would not be specific enough, and sibling concepts would change the semantic focus to different phenomena."
70025000,Lengthening of tendo calcaneus by incomplete tenotomy (procedure),Operative note: Achilles tendon lengthened through partial tenotomy technique,"This operative note records that the Achilles tendon was lengthened and the technique used was partial tenotomy. The main concept is a Procedure. 'Partial tenotomy' is synonymous with 'incomplete tenotomy,' preserving the exact procedural method described by 70025000. A generic Achilles lengthening would be less specific, and other methods (e.g., Z-plasty, complete tenotomy) are not supported by the wording. Thus, the given concept is the most precise match without introducing additional attributes."
16047007,Product containing benzodiazepine (product),Benzodiazepine-containing product,"This phrasing is a direct synonym that identifies a pharmaceutical product which contains a benzodiazepine component. It does not specify agent, strength, route, or therapy use, keeping it at the product level. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. SCTID 16047007 is the most accurate match because the statement is about a product containing benzodiazepine(s). Parent substance-level concepts are inappropriate, and more specific child products naming a particular benzodiazepine would not align with the unspecified wording. The synonym ""benzodiazepine-containing"" is semantically equivalent to ""product containing benzodiazepine"" and does not alter code selection."
170985004,Person counseled (situation),Counseled person,"This phrase signifies that counseling occurred for a person, mapping to Person counseled (situation) [170985004]. The main concept is a counseling event; no additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. More granular child concepts or procedure codes are unnecessary and less accurate because no counseling subtype or purpose is stated. The entry is a straightforward paraphrase of the preferred term."
34853001,Operation on intestine (procedure),Operative care provided: operation on intestine,"The phrase asserts that operative care consisted of an operation on the intestine, with no further details about procedural subtype or anatomical segment. It fits the Procedure category and matches Operation on intestine (procedure) SCTID 34853001. Children that specify resection, repair, or ostomy are not supported by the wording, and parents covering the entire GI tract are too broad. The wording is a faithful restatement of the preferred concept without added attributes."
1222817002,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III:6 (qualifier value),Pathology addendum: AJCC stage III,"This denotes AJCC stage III recorded in a pathology addendum, but does not specify pathologic vs clinical stage or any subclass. The concept remains AJCC stage III only. It fits the Qualifier value category and maps to SCTID 1222817002. A general parent ‘AJCC stage’ is less specific; child terms (IIIA/B/C) are absent; sibling stages (II or IV) are contradicted. The context ‘pathology addendum’ does not alter the coded stage value."
33993005,Disease type AND/OR category not applicable (situation),Disease type/category = not applicable,"Using an assignment format commonly seen in forms or reports, this entry states that disease type/category is not applicable. The main concept is the situation of inapplicability of disease classification. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This exactly maps to SCTID 33993005. Alternative concepts indicating unknown, unspecified, or not available would imply different reasons than non-applicability and are therefore less appropriate."
421377007,Ballpen spinal needle (physical object),Stock item: ballpen spinal needle,"This inventory context identifies the device as a ballpen spinal needle in stock, preserving the device type without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). No gauge, brand, or sterility details are added, so it directly aligns to the base concept. Broader parents would be non-specific; other spinal needle styles would be erroneous. SCTID 421377007 fits best."
271708004,Finding of power of skeletal muscle (finding),Clinical finding: skeletal muscle strength,"This entry frames the concept as a clinical finding related to skeletal muscle strength, fitting precisely with 271708004. There is no mention of outcome (normal/abnormal), grading, or localization, so the general finding concept is correct. The SNOMED category is Clinical finding. Sibling or child concepts like muscle tone finding or handgrip strength are avoided by maintaining generic strength/power scope across skeletal muscles. The synonym “strength” is equivalent to “power” in this context."
770376000,Product containing Cytomegalovirus terminase complex inhibitor (product),CMV terminase complex inhibitor drug,"The entry uses a clinically standard abbreviation (CMV) and specifies a ‘drug,’ clearly indicating a medicinal product within the CMV terminase inhibitor class. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. This matches SCTID 770376000 because it identifies the product class without narrowing to a particular ingredient or brand. Parent concepts like general antivirals are insufficiently specific, and sibling mechanisms (e.g., DNA polymerase inhibitors) would be incorrect. Using ‘drug’ versus ‘medication’ is a clinically equivalent synonym that keeps the selection at the product level, not the substance level."
722308008,Open-surgery ligator guide sheath (physical object),Open-approach ligator guide sheath,This entry identifies the same physical object and uses ‘open-approach’ as a synonymous descriptor of open surgery. It contains no additional attributes beyond the required device type and approach. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). The specificity to a ligator guide sheath for an open approach fits SCTID 722308008. A parent like ‘ligator guide sheath’ without approach or a sibling for endoscopic/laparoscopic approaches would not match the wording. The synonym ‘open-approach’ is equivalent in meaning and does not change coding.
467696009,"Cryogenic spray, dental (physical object)",Dental cryogenic spray device,"This entry identifies a physical device (“device”) that is a cryogenic spray intended for dental use, focusing solely on the object. The main concept is a dental refrigerant spray tool; no usage or procedural context is added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 467696009 fits best because it is the specific device for dental cryogenic spray, whereas a parent like general cryogenic spray or dental device would be too broad, and sibling devices (e.g., dental air-water syringe) are different products. The synonym “cryogenic spray device” is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not introduce new attributes, preserving the same code."
216440000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, forest (environment)",ED triage external cause location: forest,"Emergency department triage notation specifying “external cause location: forest” directly represents the intended environment concept of place of occurrence for accident/poisoning in a forest. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. No extra attributes are introduced, and the forest specification excludes parent, child, or sibling place-of-occurrence concepts. It is more accurate than generic forest environment due to the explicit external cause context."
434473001,Specimen container lid (physical object),Specimen container lid confirmed present,"The confirmed item is the lid associated with a specimen container; it is a Physical object. The precise SNOMED CT concept is 'Specimen container lid (physical object)'. A parent like 'Lid' or 'Container lid' would be too general, and siblings such as 'Specimen container' identify a different object. The confirmation context does not introduce any new attributes (e.g., type, material), maintaining alignment with the specific lid concept."
228015007,High saturated fat food (substance),High saturated fat food,"The entry names the substance class 'High saturated fat food' directly, matching SNOMED CT concept 228015007 in the Substance hierarchy. It denotes foods characterized by a high proportion of saturated fat, without implying intake, preference, restriction, or any other clinical attribute. A broader parent such as 'Food (substance)' would be too general, and a sibling like 'High fat food' lacks the saturated fat specificity. Child concepts specifying particular items (e.g., butter) would be overly narrow. Therefore, this exact term most precisely maps to 228015007."
285098003,Valley (environment),Setting documented as valley,"The text records the setting and identifies it explicitly as 'valley' without adding temporal, causal, or qualitative modifiers. This maps to the Environment semantic tag in SNOMED CT, precisely Valley (environment) SCTID 285098003. It is not better represented by broader environment categories or by different landforms like ravine or plateau. The phrase does not introduce additional attributes beyond naming the environment, keeping the concept selection precise."
766793008,Product containing dopamine receptor D2 antagonist (product),Dopamine D2 receptor–blocking medicine,"“Blocking” is a common synonym for antagonism, and “medicine” denotes a pharmaceutical product. This aligns with the product containing a dopamine D2 antagonist (766793008). Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The entry avoids naming a particular drug or formulation, keeping it at the appropriate class level. Parent concepts without receptor subtype specificity are too broad, and any specific D2 blocker product would be a child. The paraphrase does not alter the underlying mechanism or concept scope."
216340004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, building under construction (environment)",Follow-up: original incident occurred in a building under construction.,"This follow-up note reiterates the original incident's location as a building under construction, directly mapping to SNOMED CT 216340004. No additional attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. Alternative broader or different environment codes are less appropriate because the phrase clearly refers to a building under construction rather than any other construction-related setting."
433914004,Dorea longicatena (organism),Catalogued organism — Dorea longicatena,"The entry uses a cataloging context to state the organism’s name, Dorea longicatena, without clinical qualifiers. This maps to the Organism category and specifically to the species concept SCTID 433914004. Parent categories (e.g., Bacteria or Dorea genus) are too general, and child or sibling taxa would alter the identity. ‘Catalogued organism’ is a neutral descriptor and does not imply a clinical state, maintaining the pure organism concept."
227909007,Pilau rice (substance),Nutrition note lists pilau rice,"The nutrition note explicitly lists pilau rice, identifying the specific prepared rice substance. This is a Substance and maps directly to Pilau rice (substance), SCTID: 227909007. The listing context does not add attributes such as ingredients or preparation beyond what pilau inherently implies. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too broad or represent different dishes."
432458001,Class Methanopyri (organism),Record field—Class Methanopyri,"A record field naming the class Methanopyri is a pure taxonomic reference, mapping exactly to SNOMED CT 432458001 (Organism: Class Methanopyri). No attributes implying presence, site, or disease are included. The class-level wording precludes mapping to broader parents or more specific child taxa, so the class concept is the correct code."
411930005,Salix caprea specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Salix caprea species-specific diagnostic allergen extract,"The wording emphasizes species specificity and diagnostic use for an allergen extract derived from Salix caprea, clearly a product without formulation or procedural attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This matches Salix caprea specific diagnostic allergen extract (SCTID 411930005) directly. It is not a parent concept because the species is given, nor a sibling for another species, and it avoids children that would constrain formulation or test modality."
262411003,Istrica (qualifier value),Patient portal value: Istrica,"This indicates that Istrica appears as a value in a patient portal context; no clinical attributes are introduced. The concept type is Qualifier value. SNOMED CT 262411003 matches precisely. A generic parent would be too broad, and siblings would represent different values. The entry is not a finding or diagnosis; it conveys only the qualifier term."
264742008,Posterolateral to the right (qualifier value),Orientation noted as posterolateral to the right,"This documentation-style entry states an orientation qualifier: posterolateral with right laterality. It remains a Qualifier value, contributing only spatial relation information. Broader or alternate qualifiers (e.g., 'Posterolateral' without laterality or 'Right posterior') are less accurate because they do not express both the posterior and lateral components on the right side. The phrase is a context-framed synonym without added attributes, justifying the same code."
309177006,Lung direct smear specimen (specimen),Direct smear of lung specimen,"The wording conveys a specimen originating from the lung prepared as a direct smear. Category: Specimen. SCTID 309177006 is appropriate because it encodes both the anatomical source and the smear preparation. Using a broader specimen concept would omit the smear aspect, and selecting siblings tied to other respiratory sources or specific lung subtypes would introduce details not present. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent synonym without adding timing, laterality, or test results."
411833006,Trichoderma viride diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy testing item: Trichoderma viride diagnostic allergen extract,"The phrase labels a product used in allergy testing and specifies it as a diagnostic allergen extract of Trichoderma viride. No dose, route, brand, or timing details are added. SNOMED CT category: Product. “Item” is a contextual marker but the core concept remains the diagnostic allergen extract, mapping best to 411833006. Parent classes are too broad; substance-only or therapeutic siblings do not match the diagnostic product specification."
256589007,Dental rubber dam (physical object),Dental isolation rubber dam,"The phrase denotes the physical object used for isolation in dental procedures, without expressing an action of applying it. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The most precise match is Dental rubber dam (physical object) because the term names the device itself. It does not fit a procedure concept like rubber dam placement, nor accessory objects like clamps or frames. The synonym adds intended purpose (isolation) but remains within the standard identity of the rubber dam as an object and introduces no additional attributes that change code selection."
411963003,Solidago virgaurea specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Solidago virgaurea allergen extract for diagnostic use,"The product described is an allergen extract intended for diagnostic use, explicitly tied to Solidago virgaurea. Category: Product. This aligns directly with SCTID 411963003. A parent concept like 'diagnostic allergen extract' without species would be too general, while child or sibling concepts adding route (e.g., skin prick) or different species would be inaccurate. The phrase adds no concentration, mixture, or administration details."
434723003,Fluoroscopic angiography of brachial artery using contrast with insertion of drug eluting stent (procedure),Contrast fluoroscopic angiography of brachial artery followed by drug-eluting stent placement,"The entry clearly indicates contrast-enhanced fluoroscopic angiography targeting the brachial artery, followed by placement of a drug-eluting stent. Main concepts: contrast fluoroscopic angiogram of the brachial artery and DES placement. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 434723003 is precise because it includes both the imaging modality/contrast and the stent insertion of the drug-eluting type. Parent concepts for angiography alone or stent placement alone would be insufficient, and sibling concepts specifying other vessel sites or other stent types would be inaccurate. “Placement” is a standard synonym for stent insertion without changing meaning."
258570002,Genitourinary specimen (specimen),Genitourinary specimen,"The entry explicitly denotes a specimen with origin in the genitourinary system and does not specify fluid, tissue, method, site, or purpose. The main concept is a specimen entity from the genitourinary system. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This precisely matches SNOMED CT 258570002 (Genitourinary specimen). The generic parent concept “Specimen” would be too broad because it omits the body system source, and child concepts such as “Urine specimen,” “Renal tissue specimen,” or “Semen specimen” would be too specific and are not indicated by the wording. No added attributes are introduced; the phrase is a direct, clinically standard rendering of the target concept."
130266002,Diphthine synthase (substance),Diphthine synthase,"The text explicitly names the substance diphthine synthase without adding qualifiers or clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT, this maps directly to the Substance concept Diphthine synthase (SCTID 130266002). Broader parents such as Enzyme (substance) or Protein (substance) are less precise, and related siblings (e.g., other enzymes in the diphthamide pathway) are not referenced. No disorder, gene, antibody, recombinant form, or usage context is asserted, so the base substance concept is the most accurate code."
479405981000119103,History of ductal carcinoma in situ of left breast (situation),History of ductal carcinoma in situ of left breast,"The entry states a past medical history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specifically in the left breast. The main concept is DCIS with explicit temporal context (history-of) and laterality (left), and the body site is the breast. The SNOMED CT category is Situation (Situation with explicit context). This precisely matches SCTID 479405981000119103, which encodes a personal history of DCIS of the left breast. Broader parent concepts like generic personal history of breast neoplasm or personal history of DCIS without laterality are less specific, and sibling concepts such as history of DCIS of the right breast do not match the stated laterality. No additional attributes (e.g., current status, treatment, timing beyond “history”) are introduced."
362397001,Entire medial longitudinal fasciculus (body structure),Entire medial longitudinal fasciculus (anatomic structure),"“Anatomic structure” is a neutral contextual label that does not change the concept; “entire” specifies the whole medial longitudinal fasciculus. Main concept: full MLF anatomy. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This maps directly to 362397001. Concepts for mere “structure of” (parent) lack the whole-structure qualifier, and child/sibling concepts with laterality or subparts would not align with the entry."
367659001,Entire subcutaneous tissue of perianal area (body structure),Complete subcutaneous tissue encircling the anus,"“Encircling the anus” describes the perianal area, and the entry targets the subcutaneous tissue with “complete” indicating the entire layer. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This maps to SCTID 367659001 by matching tissue type, perianal location, and entirety. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings for other layers (skin, muscle) or other sites would not align. The wording is anatomical only, with no added attributes."
402607006,Constitutive skin pigmentation finding (finding),Intrinsic skin pigmentation documented on exam.,"This exam documentation records intrinsic (constitutive) skin pigmentation. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. “Intrinsic” is a clinically safe synonym for constitutive, directly supporting SCTID 402607006 rather than parent or sibling pigmentation concepts. The entry avoids additional attributes, keeping the mapping to constitutive pigmentation precise."
285547004,Ability to elevate soft palate (observable entity),History note: ability to elevate soft palate,"This entry places the observable within a history note context while still referring to the same concept—the ability to elevate the soft palate—without giving any result or temporal qualifiers beyond documentation context. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 285547004 is the exact code. Parent concepts about general palatal function are too broad, and children that encode abnormality or normality add results not present. Sibling observables of other palatal actions would be inappropriate."
307062006,Under care of clinical hematologist (finding),Managed by clinical hematologist,"“Managed by” is a common clinical synonym for under care, specifying that a clinical hematologist is directing the patient’s medical management. This is a Clinical finding representing a care relationship. SCTID 307062006 is the most precise match because it names the specific specialty. Broader parent terms are too general, and other specialties (oncology, hematopathology) are not indicated. No extraneous attributes are introduced."
122717000,Specimen from ovary obtained by subtotal left oophorectomy (specimen),Left ovary tissue specimen obtained by partial oophorectomy,"This statement denotes a specimen composed of left ovarian tissue acquired via partial (i.e., subtotal) oophorectomy. The main attributes are the organ (ovary), laterality (left), and acquisition method (partial/subtotal oophorectomy). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122717000 is the most precise match since it encodes a specimen from the ovary via subtotal left oophorectomy. Parent concepts omitting laterality or method are less specific, and siblings referring to total oophorectomy or the right ovary are inappropriate. The synonym “partial” is clinically equivalent to “subtotal” in this context and does not change the code selection."
1187500002,Island in region of Guadeloupe (geographic location),Island belonging to the region of Guadeloupe,"This entry states that the island belongs to (is part of) the region of Guadeloupe, which aligns with 'Island in region of Guadeloupe' (SCTID 1187500002). Category: Geographic location. The possessive 'belonging to' is a synonymous expression of geographic inclusion and does not alter scope or add attributes. It does not denote the entire region or a specific named island, ruling out parent or child mappings. The wording remains uniquely codable to the given concept."
397968008,Operating room equipment (physical object),Operating room equipment category,"Category signals classification context; the substantive concept is operating room equipment, which aligns with Operating room equipment (physical object), SCTID 397968008. The category is Physical object. The wording does not introduce additional attributes or specify particular devices. Using a parent like equipment would be too generic, and choosing children like operating table would not reflect the general class."
462406003,Instrument/equipment drape dispenser (physical object),Instrument/equipment drape dispensing apparatus,"Using 'dispensing apparatus' is a synonym for dispenser, maintaining the focus on drapes used for instruments/equipment. This is a Physical object and maps directly to SCTID 462406003. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., general drape dispensers or patient drape dispensers) are excluded by the explicit instrument/equipment qualifier."
223993000,East Falkland (geographic location),Place of birth: East Falkland,"The text identifies East Falkland as the birthplace, focusing on the geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The ‘birthplace’ context doesn’t add clinical qualifiers to the location and maps most accurately to SCTID 223993000, not to the archipelago or other islands, ensuring specificity to East Falkland."
1345040001,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine not done (situation),Pharmacy note: COVID-19 vaccination not done,"This pharmacy documentation asserts that the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination has not been done, which directly maps to SCTID 1345040001. The concept is the absence of the specific vaccine administration, without reasons, brand, dose, or schedule details. Category: Situation. Broader parents are too general, and siblings such as “declined” or “contraindicated” are not supported by the phrasing. “Vaccination not done” is a standard clinical synonym and does not change the concept."
31210009,"Salmonella IV 43:g,z51:- (organism)","Salmonella enterica subsp. houtenae serotype 43:g,z51:-","The entry uses the formally named subspecies (houtenae equals subspecies IV) and the serotype 43:g,z51:-, precisely identifying the same organism. The main concept is the organism taxon. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 31210009 is appropriate for Salmonella IV 43:g,z51:-; using 'subsp. houtenae' is a recognized synonym for subspecies IV and does not alter the code choice. Parent concepts without the serotype are broader; other serotypes are siblings."
249094009,Anterior brow position (finding),Fetal brow is anterior,"The statement describes the fetal brow (frontum) being anterior relative to the maternal pelvis, which is the definition of an anterior brow position. This is a Clinical finding and maps directly to SNOMED CT 249094009. It is more specific than the parent 'Brow position' and does not suggest a different position like posterior or transverse. It avoids mention of left/right variants, timing, or etiology, maintaining exact equivalence."
358245002,Basic bicarbonate hemodialysis liquid concentrate (product),Pharmacy: issue bicarbonate base liquid concentrate for hemodialysis,"An ordering/issuance statement specifying a bicarbonate base liquid concentrate for hemodialysis. Category: Product. It matches SCTID 358245002 by stating bicarbonate, base/basic, liquid, concentrate, and HD, and avoids siblings like acid concentrate or dry bicarbonate cartridges and broader parent concepts. The pharmacy context does not change the product semantics."
252131008,Time from start of test (observable entity),Time since the beginning of the test,"This phrase describes elapsed time relative to when the test began, which is the intended observable. The category is Observable entity, and SCTID 252131008 is the best match because it defines time from the start of test. It avoids implying absolute timestamps or the total test length, making parent/sibling concepts like 'Test start time' or 'Test duration' inappropriate. The synonym 'beginning of the test' is equivalent to 'start of test' without changing the code selection. Therefore, the entry corresponds precisely to 'Time from start of test (observable entity)'."
299497007,Range of midtarsal supination (observable entity),Registry term: midtarsal supination range,"As a registry term, it identifies the same observable property—the extent of supination movement at the midtarsal joint—without adding attributes like laterality, timing, or status. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 299497007 precisely matches this parameter. Parent categories like general midtarsal joint range of motion are too broad, and sibling concepts that involve pronation or other joints represent different observables. The registry context does not change the clinical meaning and keeps the code selection intact."
160899000,Recently unemployed (finding),Newly unemployed,"The phrase 'newly unemployed' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'recently unemployed,' indicating unemployment with recent onset. It represents a Clinical finding. SCTID 160899000 is the correct match due to the recency modifier. The parent 'Unemployed (finding)' is insufficiently specific as it lacks recency, and other employment-related siblings describe different statuses. No cause, timeframe beyond 'recent,' or severity is introduced."
411956003,Lupinus species specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen preparation: Lupine genus,"This represents a product used in diagnostic allergy testing and specifies the Lupine (Lupinus) genus. Category: Product. 'Preparation' is a permissible synonym in the product context and does not imply therapeutic use or a particular formulation. It matches 411956003 precisely, avoiding over-specific children (e.g., pollen-only) or general parents."
223813002,Sligo (geographic location),Registration record location value: Sligo,"The phrase indicates that the registration record’s location value is “Sligo.” This expresses only the geographic location name without qualifiers such as administrative type or country. It aligns with SNOMED CT’s Qualifier value → Geographic location category, mapped specifically to Sligo (geographic location) SCTID 223813002. A parent concept would be too generic, and no text suggests a child/sibling like county or town. The registration context is administrative and does not alter the coding."
297439003,Nubian language (qualifier value),Language selection: Nubian language,"This indicates that the language selected as a value is “Nubian language,” which is a Qualifier value; SCTID 297439003 is exact. The context of selection does not introduce additional attributes (e.g., preference level or modality), so the coding remains at the language value. It is more specific than the parent “Language (qualifier value)” and avoids reference to any child dialect or sibling language. The phrasing is a safe paraphrase of the preferred term, preserving the same coded concept."
228372006,Poly-drug misuser (finding),Chart lists patient as a multi-drug misuser,"The chart context shows a recorded finding: the patient misuses multiple drugs. “Multi-drug” is synonymous with “poly-drug,” pointing to SCTID 228372006 (Clinical finding). No attributes like timing, severity, or specific drug types are added. Parent concepts lack the multiple-drug detail, and disorder siblings (abuse/dependence) are not indicated, making this finding the correct code."
446713007,Laparoscopic partial excision of ureter (procedure),Laparoscopic partial removal of ureter,"This denotes a procedure of removing part of the ureter via laparoscopy. Attributes: action (removal/excision), extent (partial), site (ureter), approach (laparoscopic). Category: Procedure. “Partial removal” is clinically synonymous with partial excision in surgical documentation. With the laparoscopic approach specified, the entry aligns with SCTID 446713007. A parent concept omitting the approach is less precise, and siblings like open partial removal or total ureterectomy represent different techniques or extents. The wording avoids laterality, timing qualifiers, and additional steps, so it maps uniquely to the intended concept."
467944008,"Contact lens thermal cleaner, battery-powered (physical object)","Thermal contact lens cleaner, battery-powered unit","The entry indicates a unit for thermal cleaning of contact lenses that is battery-powered. In SNOMED CT, this is a Physical object (Device). The explicit pairing of thermal modality and battery power aligns with SCTID 467944008. More general device categories or parent concepts without the battery detail, and siblings that are mains-powered or non-thermal cleaners, would not be as precise given the wording."
227788006,Onion bhaji (substance),Onion bhaji item,"Main concept: onion bhaji, referred to as an item; no attributes such as cause, timing, or severity are provided. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This aligns directly with Onion bhaji (substance), SCTID 227788006. A parent concept would be overly general, and siblings (onion, other bhaji/pakora variants) would not match the exact dish. The term 'item' is contextual and does not change code selection."
167939004,Marrow megakaryocytes abnormal (finding),Marrow megakaryocytes abnormal,"The entry directly states that megakaryocytes within the bone marrow are abnormal, without specifying the type of abnormality, severity, etiology, or timing. The main concept is an abnormal finding involving marrow megakaryocytes. This is a Clinical finding and maps precisely to SNOMED CT 167939004 (Marrow megakaryocytes abnormal). Broader parent concepts like generic abnormal bone marrow findings are too nonspecific, while child concepts such as megakaryocyte hyperplasia, hypoplasia, or dysplasia are more specific than the wording indicates. No sibling concept (e.g., abnormal megakaryocytes without location) is as accurate because the marrow location is explicit."
399752001,Specimen from anus obtained by abdominoperineal resection (specimen),Anus excision specimen from APE,"This denotes an anus excision specimen obtained during APE (abdominoperineal excision), a recognized synonym for abdominoperineal resection. The category is Specimen. The term 'APE' and 'excision specimen' are clinically equivalent to APR and do not alter the concept, ensuring an exact match to 399752001 rather than broader or different procedure-based specimens."
469738005,Eye spud (physical object),Instrument: eye spud,"Documented as an instrument, the main concept is the eye spud, an ophthalmic device. No procedural details or variant specifications are included. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, making SCTID 469738005 the most exact code. Parent categories like generic instruments would be overly broad, and siblings (e.g., eye curette) are not mentioned. Absence of qualifiers like corneal or foreign-body implies the general eye spud rather than a child subtype."
402106003,Stoma caps (physical object),Ostomy stoma cap,"This term clearly indicates the cap device intended for an ostomy stoma, with no extra qualifiers. As a Physical object, it maps precisely to Stoma caps (402106003). More general codes (ostomy appliance) are overly broad, and different device types like pouches, filters, or plugs are siblings that do not match a cap. No ostomy-site specificity is given; therefore, child concepts are not appropriate."
249430008,External larynx finding (finding),External laryngeal finding observed,"The entry states that a finding involving the external larynx was observed, with no further attributes specified. The main concept is a clinical finding local to the external laryngeal structures. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. SCTID 249430008 best fits. Parents (general larynx findings) are too broad; children/siblings (specific abnormalities or internal laryngeal findings) are not indicated by the wording."
1193630001,Island in region of Wallis and Futuna (geographic location),facility location: island in the region of Wallis and Futuna,"The facility location is specified as an island within the region of Wallis and Futuna; no additional geographic detail is included. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 1193630001 is the precise match, as it encodes the island-level detail within the stated region, avoiding both the broader region parent concept and any specific island child concepts."
223941002,Tayside (geographic location),Geographic location: Tayside,"The entry explicitly labels Tayside as a geographic location, which matches the SNOMED CT category Geographic location (Location). The concept is the named place Tayside, and thus 223941002 is the precise code. Parent classes are overly broad, and sibling or child concepts (towns, counties, organizations) are not stated, avoiding misclassification."
27126002,"Power belt, device (physical object)",Power belt,"Main concept: power belt, understood as a device. Category: Physical object — Device. Omitting the word 'device' still denotes the manufactured object type recognized by SNOMED CT; the semantic tag for the concept is device (physical object). No attributes such as purpose or condition are specified, so SCTID 27126002 is the correct match. Selecting a parent 'belt' concept would be imprecise, and siblings like seat or safety belts would add unintended semantics."
373860006,Afterloaded brachytherapy source (observable entity),Brachytherapy source type recorded as afterloaded,"The main concept is an observable classification of the source in brachytherapy, explicitly noted as afterloaded. This matches SNOMED CT 373860006 (Observable entity). It remains within source typology and avoids procedural, device, or dose-rate details, preventing misclassification to broader ‘brachytherapy source’ or more specific children like HDR/LDR or isotope-based sources."
128172000,Tissue specimen from throat (specimen),Throat tissue sample,"This entry uses sample as a clinically equivalent synonym for specimen and clearly indicates the material type (tissue) and source (throat). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It aligns with Tissue specimen from throat (specimen), SCTID 128172000. Parent concepts that omit the site are too general, and sibling concepts that change the specimen type (e.g., swab, brush, cytology) would not match. No method like biopsy or resection is stated, so child concepts with procedural qualifiers are not appropriate."
309951004,Blood transfusion department (environment),Care setting: blood transfusion department,"This indicates the care setting is the blood transfusion department, emphasizing the environment rather than any procedure or event. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It aligns with 309951004 rather than broader hospital environment concepts. It does not imply a blood bank or lab. The phrasing is a context label, not an added attribute to the concept itself."
114232006,Genus Orientia (organism),History note: Orientia (genus) cited,"In a history note, the organism referenced is Orientia at the genus rank, made explicit by the parenthetical. There are no clinical findings or species-level specifications. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The correct mapping is to 114232006 (Genus Orientia). More general parent taxa would not match the specificity, and child species concepts would not reflect the genus-level phrasing. The contextual wording does not introduce attributes that alter the code choice."
5748001,Axon and peripheral nervous system function (observable entity),Axon and peripheral nervous system functional observation,"Referring to this as a 'functional observation' still denotes the same observable entity describing function of axons and the PNS, without adding interpretation or results. The main concept is axon/PNS function, and no extra attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This aligns with SCTID 5748001 because it captures both components and their functional aspect. Broader observables or modality-specific siblings (e.g., nerve conduction, EMG-derived measures) are not implicated by the wording. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym of the preferred concept."
51765001,Carbon monoxide (substance),Carbon monoxide listed,"This phrasing indicates that carbon monoxide is listed by name, pointing to the substance itself without adding attributes of exposure or diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Thus, 51765001 Carbon monoxide (substance) is the precise mapping; no related parent/sibling concepts like carbon dioxide or any clinical finding involving CO are implied."
263774009,"Hair weaving, function (observable entity)",Rehabilitation observable—hair weaving function,"The entry frames hair weaving function as an observable in rehabilitation without providing a result. It belongs to the Observable entity category and maps to SNOMED CT 263774009. More general functional observables or grooming domains would be parent-level and less precise, while other hair-specific tasks are siblings. There is no wording indicating a cosmetic procedure, preventing misclassification as a procedure."
232741007,Inspection of mitral valve (procedure),Inspection of mitral valve structure,"This entry denotes an inspection focusing on the mitral valve structure, which aligns directly with inspecting the mitral valve anatomically. The main concept is a Procedure: inspection of the mitral valve, mapping to 'Inspection of mitral valve' (232741007). The phrase 'structure' is consistent with SNOMED body structure terminology and does not introduce additional attributes. Parent concepts for heart valve inspection would be too general, while children specifying technique or siblings describing intervention or imaging would not reflect the simple inspection stated."
171249001,Urine screening due (finding),Care plan item: urine screening due.,"This care plan entry notes the Clinical finding that a urine screening is due. SCTID 171249001 is appropriate as it captures due status for urine screening without implying a particular urine test subtype or reason. General screening due would be too broad, and specifying types or an overdue state would conflict with the wording."
108143005,Cornea excision (procedure),Corneal tissue excision,"The phrase conveys excision of tissue from the cornea, squarely a Procedure. It corresponds to Cornea excision (108143005). The lack of technique, extent, site laterality, or purpose means it should not be mapped to child concepts such as phototherapeutic keratectomy, nor to sibling concepts like incision or transplant. The synonym retains the same clinical meaning as the preferred term."
86039003,Preventive dental procedure (procedure),Preventive dental intervention,"This describes an intervention within dentistry aimed at prevention, which falls under the SNOMED CT Procedure hierarchy. 'Intervention' is a standard synonym for procedure in clinical documentation. The appropriate code is 86039003 Preventive dental procedure. Broader parents (Dental procedure) lack the preventive qualifier, and specific children (e.g., sealant application, prophylaxis) are not indicated by the general wording used here."
103322003,Request by third party on behalf of patient (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value),Request initiated by a third party for the patient,"This phrase identifies that the request originator was a third party and that it was done for the patient, matching the qualifier value 'Request by third party on behalf of patient.' The attributes present are requester role and relationship; no other details are introduced. As a Qualifier value, it serves to contextualize who initiated the request. A parent concept of generic request context would be less precise, and sibling qualifiers like patient-initiated or provider-initiated requests do not fit the wording. 'Initiated by a third party' is a clinically safe paraphrase that maintains equivalence."
258435002,Tumor tissue specimen (specimen),Surgeon’s note: tumor tissue specimen collected,"This surgeon’s note confirms a specimen comprised of tumor tissue was collected, without specifying collection method (biopsy vs resection) or site. Category: Specimen. Absence of added attributes makes Tumor tissue specimen SCTID 258435002 the most accurate code. More general tissue specimen lacks tumor specificity, and method-specific child/sibling concepts are not supported."
223855006,Corsica (geographic location),Corsica — geographic place,"The entry presents Corsica and clarifies it as a geographic place, which corresponds to Corsica (geographic location) in SNOMED CT, SCTID 223855006. The descriptor 'geographic place' does not introduce new attributes; it restates the category (Location). There are no references to smaller units within Corsica or related locations that would justify a child or sibling code. The text does not introduce events (travel, residence, exposure), so finding-type concepts are not relevant. The specific, named place makes the precise location code preferable over the broader parent Geographic location."
72339004,Canicola haemoglobinophilus (organism),Microbiology organism name—Haemoglobinophilus canicola,"This is a lab-report style entry naming the organism Haemoglobinophilus canicola and does not imply infection status or sample source. It maps to the SNOMED CT Organism category and the species SCTID 72339004. The explicit species name rules out broader genus-level coding and more specific strain-level coding; no sibling or alternate genus is mentioned, ensuring the species-level organism is the best match."
223731005,Natal (geographic location),Natal — geographic place,This identifies Natal and clarifies it is a geographic place. Main concept: place name 'Natal'. No added attributes beyond place categorization. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. It precisely matches Natal (geographic location) [223731005]. Parent is too general; sibling or child concepts would represent different or more specific areas. 'Geographic place' is an equivalent phrase confirming the same concept.
430970004,Core sample of tissue block (specimen),Core plug from tissue block,"The term 'core plug' is commonly used to describe a cylindrical core extracted from a block, and 'from tissue block' fixes the source. Category: Specimen. SCTID 430970004 is the correct code because it represents a core sample of a tissue block; using a parent concept would ignore that it is a derived core, and siblings like sections or scrolls would misclassify the specimen type. 'Core plug' is a synonym for core sample and does not introduce new attributes."
223833003,Skiathos (geographic location),Skiathos (geographic location),"The phrase explicitly labels the toponym as a geographic location, matching the SNOMED CT concept Skiathos (geographic location), SCTID 223833003. The main concept is a place, with no added clinical attributes or qualifiers such as administrative level, island status, or town designation. Parent concepts (e.g., country or region) would be overly broad, while children or siblings representing specific features or jurisdictions would be too narrow. The category is Geographic location (Location), and the exact wording confirms the precise match."
216290003,"Accident involving collision between powered vehicle, used solely within the buildings and premises of an industrial or commercial establishment, and another vehicle (event)","Patient statement: ""At work, a powered vehicle we use only on the premises hit another vehicle.""","This patient-reported narrative describes an accident event characterized by a collision between a powered vehicle that is restricted to use on industrial/commercial premises and another vehicle. Attributes: premises-only powered vehicle, collision, other vehicle. Category: Event. SCTID 216290003 is the most precise selection given it codifies collisions involving a premises-only powered vehicle and another vehicle. Parent concepts lacking premises specificity or vehicle involvement detail would be less precise. Child concepts for specific machine types (e.g., forklift) are not justified as none is named. Sibling codes dealing with collisions with fixed objects or persons are inappropriate."
78418002,Operation on heart and pericardium (procedure),Surgical treatment of heart and pericardium,"The phrase 'surgical treatment' is clinically equivalent to 'operation' and explicitly references heart and pericardium as the anatomical scope, without introducing timing, approach, or specific target details. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 78418002 is the correct code because it represents operations on heart and pericardium. Parent categories that encompass broader regions are less precise, and child concepts for specific surgeries are not indicated. Sibling concepts for heart-only or pericardium-only procedures would be underinclusive given the stated scope."
223407001,Tenerife (geographic location),Follow-up note location reference: Tenerife,"Here, Tenerife is referenced as a location within a follow-up note. The coded concept stays the geographic location Tenerife, aligned with SNOMED CT's Location > Geographic location. No additional clinical attributes are conveyed. Broader (Canary Islands/Spain) or narrower (municipalities on Tenerife) concepts would misrepresent the explicit place named."
224725001,External domestic passageway (environment),Exterior home passageway (environment),"This phrasing describes an outdoor passageway at a home, clearly indicating an environmental context. The main concept is the external domestic passageway. Category: Environment or geographical location. 'Exterior' is synonymous with 'external' and 'home' is synonymous with 'domestic,' while 'passageway' is retained. No additional attributes are introduced, making SCTID 224725001 the precise match rather than broader domestic environment or more specific structures like stairs."
223826003,Corfu (geographic location),Toponym recorded as Corfu,"The term “toponym” indicates a place name, and the recorded name is Corfu. No extra qualifiers are provided, so the concept remains the geographic location only. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The appropriate code is Corfu (geographic location) SCTID 223826003. Parent concepts are nonspecific, and child/sibling entities (such as Corfu city or other Ionian islands) are not referenced; the entry cleanly represents the Corfu place name."
223685003,North American country (geographic location),North American country (place),"Adding ‘(place)’ emphasizes the geographic nature without altering meaning. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The entry matches 223685003 by specifying a country located in North America, avoiding additional attributes or specificity. Parent concepts lacking the continent constraint are too broad; child concepts naming specific countries are too narrow; siblings such as European country would be incorrect for this continental qualifier."
223399006,Sark (geographic location),Location referenced: Sark,"The text references the place ‘Sark’ without adding contextual details, maintaining a pure location value. The main concept is the geographic location; category: Geographic location (Qualifier value). It does not imply other findings like travel history or residence. Parent and sibling locations would not be as precise for this named place. The correct selection is Sark (geographic location) 223399006."
223609006,Israel (geographic location),Israel (country),"Adding '(country)' clarifies the semantic tag to the geographic entity rather than people or nationality. The main concept is the nation-state as a place. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). SCTID 223609006 matches precisely. Parent concepts are overly general; child/sibling concepts (e.g., 'Jerusalem') are not intended here. The bracketed clarification is equivalent and does not change code selection."
258961008,Microgram/day/square meter (qualifier value),Microgram per day per square metre (BSA-based),"The parenthetical note reflects the body surface area normalization implied by per square metre; the unit remains μg/day/m^2. The concept is a unit qualifier value. Category: Qualifier value. It corresponds to Microgram/day/square meter (258961008), not to a general BSA concept or other units like mg/day/m^2. The added context does not introduce new attributes or change code selection."
160825002,Poor family relationship (finding),Unhealthy family relationship,"Describing the family relationship as 'unhealthy' communicates poor quality without specifying cause, severity, timing, or a specific relative. The main concept is a poor family relationship and is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 160825002 fits because it represents a negative assessment of family relationship quality. A parent concept would be overly general, and siblings like 'family dysfunction' or 'inadequate support' imply different attributes not in this statement. 'Unhealthy' functions here as a synonym for poor quality and does not change the intended coding."
1290214003,Soil degradation (event),Soil degradation (event),"This entry exactly mirrors the preferred term and its hierarchy, leaving no ambiguity. Category: Event. It is the most precise match and clearly excludes parent and child/sibling concepts by naming the concept as defined in SNOMED CT."
446239009,Starmerella magnoliae (organism),Lab catalog entry — Starmerella magnoliae,"The wording places Starmerella magnoliae as a catalog or reference label, not a clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 446239009 is the precise species-level match. Parent concepts (e.g., Yeast or Starmerella genus) are overly broad; sibling species are different organisms. No implication of detection or infection is made."
284441008,Shopping center (environment),Setting: shopping center,"This entry defines the setting as a shopping center, mapping precisely to concept 284441008 in the Environment or geographical location category. It avoids implying a particular type of store or market. Parent-level retail environments are too broad, and siblings like market or grocery store would be inaccurate. The wording introduces no extra clinical attributes."
258563002,Amniotic cell specimen (specimen),Amniotic cells sample,"Using “sample” to denote the specimen type preserves the meaning of a cellular specimen derived from amniotic fluid. This aligns with Amniotic cell specimen (258563002) in the Specimen category. The phrase does not add attributes (e.g., culture, adequacy, test purpose), so broader parents (cell specimen) or siblings (amniotic fluid specimen) are less appropriate."
309135006,Hydrocele specimen (specimen),Sample obtained from hydrocele,"This entry states that a sample was obtained from a hydrocele, i.e., a specimen from a hydrocele source. The wording avoids specifying collection method or material type and omits laterality. It belongs in the Specimen hierarchy and is best coded as Hydrocele specimen (specimen), SCTID 309135006. Parent concepts would be too general, and children indicating aspirate or biopsy would be too specific. “Sample” is clinically equivalent to “specimen” and does not change the code."
362114003,Entire cementum (body structure),Educational topic noted: cementum,"The statement identifies cementum as the educational topic focused on the anatomical structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It corresponds to SCTID 362114003 (Entire cementum) since the subject is the whole cementum tissue; there is no mention of subtypes, pathology, or partial regions. Parent concepts like “tooth anatomy” are broader, and sibling structures (enamel, dentin) are different entities. The synonym usage does not alter the target body structure code."
897201003,Product containing recombinant interleukin 2 (product),Biologic agent: recombinant interleukin-2 product,"This entry identifies a biologic agent product containing recombinant interleukin-2. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The descriptor “biologic agent” is a synonym for product type, and no additional attributes such as dose, route, or brand are present, matching SCTID 897201003. A non-recombinant parent concept would be less specific, and child concepts specifying formulation or strength are not supported by the text."
34097003,"Craniectomy for excision of meningioma, infratentorial (procedure)",Craniectomy for excision of infratentorial meningioma,"The entry explicitly combines three elements: the operative approach (craniectomy), the target pathology (meningioma), and the anatomical context (infratentorial). This is a Procedure in SNOMED CT. The phrasing aligns exactly with SCTID 34097003, which specifies craniectomy for excision of a meningioma in the infratentorial compartment. More general parents such as “Craniectomy” or “Excision of meningioma” lack the location specificity and/or the approach. Sibling concepts like “Craniotomy for excision of meningioma, infratentorial” would be incorrect because the approach here is craniectomy, not craniotomy. No additional attributes (e.g., laterality, extent) are introduced, making this the most precise match."
439165004,Education about influenza vaccine during pregnancy (procedure),Antenatal health teaching on influenza vaccine,"This documents antenatal (during pregnancy) health teaching—an education procedure—focused on the influenza vaccine. Category: Procedure. SCTID 439165004 is correct because it specifies the educational action, the influenza vaccine topic, and pregnancy context. Parent concepts like antenatal education without a vaccine topic or general vaccine teaching without pregnancy are too broad; vaccination delivery concepts are not applicable."
104492003,Aliphatic carboxylate C14-C26 absorption measurement (procedure),Test name: C14–C26 long-chain fatty acid absorption measurement,"This indicates the procedural test measuring absorption of long-chain fatty acids restricted to C14–C26, which is equivalent to aliphatic carboxylates in that range, mapping to SNOMED CT 104492003 (Procedure). Parent fat or lipid absorption tests would be broader, and siblings targeting short/medium chains or specific fatty acids would not match. The synonym “long-chain fatty acid” is appropriate given the chain-length stated."
702879002,Laser eye clinic (environment),Clinical location: laser eye clinic,"This states a clinical location and specifies that it is a laser eye clinic. It presents only the environment and avoids procedural, temporal, or severity attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the exact concept is Laser eye clinic (environment) SCTID 702879002. Parent or sibling concepts are less precise because they do not denote the laser specialization or are not eye-specific. The phrase is a documentation-style paraphrase that is semantically equivalent."
72427008,"History and physical examination, follow-up examination for cardiovascular disease (procedure)",Follow-up patient assessment for cardiovascular disease (history and physical),"The entry communicates a follow-up assessment and clarifies it is a history and physical in the setting of cardiovascular disease. Main concept: follow-up H&P for cardiovascular disease. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. 'Assessment' is often used interchangeably with H&P when explicitly defined, as here. This maps to 72427008. Without mentioning cardiovascular disease, it would be a broader parent concept; adding a specific cardiac diagnosis would make it too narrow compared to the general 'cardiovascular disease' scope."
56476000,Subcutaneous tissue structure of umbilical region (body structure),Operative field: umbilical region subcutaneous tissue,"This operative context highlights the subcutaneous tissue located in the umbilical region. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The entry matches SCTID 56476000 as it specifies both the tissue layer (subcutaneous) and the exact region (umbilical). Parent-level concepts without location would be incomplete, and sibling concepts for other tissues would be incorrect. No procedure details or conditions are asserted beyond naming the anatomical site."
257557008,Place (environment),Encounter documentation: place (environment),"This entry logs the environmental entity 'place' in encounter documentation without any subtype. The concept category is Environment or geographical location. It fits 'Place (environment)' because it maintains genericity. Children such as 'School (environment)' or 'Park (environment)' are not supported by the text. Using a qualifier value like 'Location' would be incorrect, as this expresses an environmental entity, not a qualifier."
445447003,Specimen from trachea obtained by aspiration (specimen),Specimen from trachea obtained by aspiration,"This entry reproduces the FSN-style description, identifying a specimen sourced from the trachea with the method of procurement being aspiration. It is a Specimen category concept. Because the wording exactly matches the defining attributes—site and method—it maps precisely to SCTID 445447003. More general parent concepts (e.g., respiratory tract specimen) omit the aspiration method or the explicit tracheal site, while sibling alternatives like swab or lavage would change the method. No additional attributes (e.g., timing, reason for testing) are introduced."
23450008,Babesia perroncitoi (organism),Reference: Babesia perroncitoi,"This entry references the species name itself, pointing to the organism Babesia perroncitoi with no clinical attributes. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The appropriate code is 23450008 Babesia perroncitoi (organism). Parent genus or other species would be less specific, and no infection/finding attribute is asserted."
767102007,Medicinal product categorized by chemical element (product),Formulary header: element-based medicinal product category,"This is a formulary header for a category of medicinal products defined by chemical element, without naming a particular element or adding dose/route. The SNOMED CT category is Product (pharmaceutical/biologic medicinal product). Parent concepts lack the explicit element-based categorization, and children with a specified element are not supported by the wording."
63106003,Gobionellus atripinnis (organism),Species identification: Gobionellus atripinnis,"This reflects a species-level taxonomic identification with the specific binomial Gobionellus atripinnis. The core concept is the organism. Category: Organism. The phrase indicates identification but does not add attributes such as site, disease, or timing; the coded value is the species itself. Parent concepts (genus or higher taxa) are too broad, and siblings (other species) are not implied. SCTID 63106003 is the exact match."
763003,Monodon monoceros (organism),Patient states the animal was a “narwhal”,"This patient-reported statement names the animal as a narwhal, an exact common-name synonym of Monodon monoceros, without adding exposure, injury, or other attributes. It maps to the Organism category and corresponds to Monodon monoceros (organism), SCTID 763003. The wording does not broaden to generic whales or point to a different species, so parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate."
91787002,Structure of dorsal metacarpal artery (body structure),Dorsal metacarpal artery (hand),"This entry names the dorsal metacarpal artery and contextually notes its location in the hand, which is inherent to the vessel’s standard anatomy. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The parenthetical 'hand' does not introduce new attributes; it confirms the typical site. Therefore, SCTID 91787002 is the most accurate code. A parent like 'artery of hand' would be too general, and a sibling such as 'palmar metacarpal artery' would be incorrect given the dorsal specification."
223392002,Moorea (geographic location),Moorea,"The entry states the place name Moorea without any additional qualifiers. The main concept is the geographic location Moorea. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Location hierarchy as a Geographic location; the precise concept is Moorea (geographic location), SCTID 223392002. No extra attributes (e.g., timing, severity, clinical events) are introduced. Parent concepts such as French Polynesia or Society Islands would be too broad, and sibling locations like Tahiti would be incorrect. This directly matches the most specific location concept for Moorea."
316894002,Open grade IIIb (qualifier value),Open Grade 3B,"Using Arabic numerals, “Open Grade 3B” is a common clinical variant equivalent to “Open grade IIIB.” It conveys only the classification grade, with no added details about condition or location. SNOMED CT categorizes this as a Qualifier value, and SCTID 316894002 matches Grade IIIb precisely. Parent or sibling grade values would not be accurate, and the numeral style does not affect the code mapping."
34564005,Creation of shunt of ascending aorta to pulmonary artery (procedure),Creation of central aortopulmonary shunt from ascending aorta to PA,"This describes creation of a central aortopulmonary shunt, explicitly stating ascending aorta to pulmonary artery. Concepts: shunt creation; ascending aorta inflow; pulmonary artery outflow; category: Procedure. SCTID 34564005 is the best match because it requires ascending aorta to PA connection. A general central shunt concept would be less specific, and child concepts with laterality or device type are not supported here. The synonym 'central aortopulmonary shunt' is valid when qualified by ascending aorta."
242504007,Burning due to contact with hot water in bucket (event),Burn mechanism: hot water in bucket contact,"This entry clarifies the burn mechanism as contact with hot water in a bucket. Concepts: burn mechanism and specific container source. Category: Event. SCTID 242504007 aligns with this description, capturing burning due to contact with hot water in a bucket. It avoids additional qualifiers like body site or severity, therefore remaining distinct from parents lacking the bucket context or siblings describing other hot liquid sources."
272130008,Age values (qualifier value),Use age values qualifier,"This instruction-style entry specifies that the qualifier to be used is the age values domain, fitting the Qualifier value category. It does not add a measurement or a group classification. The best match is Age values (qualifier value) SCTID 272130008 and not the observable 'Age' or 'Age group'."
276446009,Cervical smear specimen (specimen),Specimen label: cervical smear,"This is a labeling context that identifies the specimen as a cervical smear, clearly a smear specimen from the cervix. It belongs to the Specimen category. SCTID 276446009 exactly fits this description. Parent codes that are more general and children with added subsite or technique details are not appropriate given the wording. Sibling specimens (e.g., cervical swab, brush, biopsy) are excluded by the 'smear' modality. The labeling context adds no clinical attributes or results, ensuring precise mapping to the specimen concept."
710539000,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Thermoactinomyces (substance),Analyte: Thermoactinomyces IgG antibody,"The wording lists the substance as an analyte by name: IgG antibody to Thermoactinomyces. It refers to the molecule itself and does not provide an order, result, or quantification. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance, and SCTID 710539000 is the specific match. A procedure/test concept would be inappropriate because no diagnostic action is stated, and broader or different-class antibody concepts would be less precise. 'Analyte' is contextual but does not change the underlying substance concept."
765125009,Product containing glycopeptide (product),Therapeutic product containing a glycopeptide,"The text refers to a therapeutic drug product whose active ingredient class is glycopeptide, with no added attributes such as route, dose, or brand. It corresponds to the SNOMED CT Product category and matches Product containing glycopeptide (product), SCTID 765125009. Substance concepts (e.g., glycopeptide antibiotic (substance)) are inappropriate because this is explicitly a product. More specific children (product containing vancomycin, teicoplanin, etc.) are not indicated, and broader antimicrobial product parents are insufficiently specific."
224233001,Sleeping in vehicle (finding),Patient reports sleeping in a vehicle,"This entry indicates a patient-reported finding that they sleep in a vehicle, with no mention of reason, timing, frequency, or vehicle subtype. The main concept is sleeping within a vehicle, and the SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 224233001 is the most precise code because it explicitly represents sleeping in a vehicle. A parent code like 'Sleeping (finding)' would miss the locational element, and any child specifying a particular vehicle (e.g., car) would not be justified by the wording. Siblings that describe different sleep locations are not applicable."
773143005,Magnetic resonance imaging of left orbit (procedure),Imaging: MRI focused on left orbit,"This phrase specifies a magnetic resonance imaging procedure directed at the left orbit, with modality and laterality clear. It is a Procedure in SNOMED CT. SCTID 773143005 is the correct code for MRI of the left orbit. Parent concepts lacking laterality or more general head imaging are less appropriate, while siblings for the right orbit or both orbits are incorrect. The wording adds no attributes beyond site and modality."
255619001,Total (qualifier value),Observation qualifier: total,"Presenting ‘total’ as an observation qualifier maintains its role as a Qualifier value. The correct mapping is Total (qualifier value) [255619001]. There are no observable entity details or measurements provided; it is strictly the qualifier term. Because the wording uses ‘total’ and does not imply Partial/Subtotal or alternatives like Complete/Entire/Full, parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate than the specific ‘total’ qualifier."
1366599006,"Family Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, Resolve score (observable entity)",APGAR-F score (family),"‘APGAR-F’ is a recognized synonym for the Family APGAR. Including '(family)' further disambiguates from neonatal Apgar. The entry refers to the score itself, not the test administration or a result value, aligning with the Observable entity category. Thus, SCTID 1366599006 is the most precise match. Parent concepts such as general score observables are too broad, and sibling procedure or scale concepts would be inappropriate because the wording targets the score. No additional attributes are introduced by this synonym."
224040005,Alaska (geographic location),Geographic location: Alaska,"The entry is a documentation-style label followed by the place name, pointing strictly to the location Alaska. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 224040005 is appropriate. Broader concepts like United States or specific Alaskan cities are not indicated. The heading “Geographic location:” does not imply new attributes (e.g., residence or exposure); it simply contextualizes the concept for documentation."
388015004,Trachurus japonicus specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Japanese horse mackerel-specific immunoglobulin E,"Main concept: specific IgE to Japanese horse mackerel, the common name for Trachurus japonicus. Attributes: IgE class and species specificity. SNOMED CT category: Substance. Japanese horse mackerel is a recognized common name for Trachurus japonicus, so this maps to SCTID 388015004. No additional attributes like specimen, results, or severity are added. Parent concepts like 'mackerel-specific IgE' are ambiguous among species; siblings like IgE to Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) would be incorrect."
297820002,Comanche language (qualifier value),Language: Comanche,"This documentation-style entry identifies the language value as Comanche and functions as a selection within a language field. The main concept is Comanche as a language; no severity, timing, or other attributes are implied. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, specifically Comanche language (297820002). Parent categories like generic language are too broad, and sibling concepts like other languages or any Comanche ethnic group terms would not match the explicit language reference."
115873007,Blood group antigen Rg2 (substance),Rg2 antigen included in discussion,"Mentioning Rg2 in discussion still references the antigen substance without implying presence/absence or antibodies. This aligns with SNOMED CT Substance Blood group antigen Rg2 (115873007). Parent terms that aggregate Rodgers antigens are overly broad, and sibling antigens (e.g., Rg1) would be incorrect. The entry avoids clinical findings or test results, maintaining focus on the antigen entity."
84346001,Salmonella Bardo (organism),Microbiology record: Salmonella Bardo,"As a context label followed by the organism name, this entry represents the organism concept and not a result or diagnosis. It maps to SNOMED CT Organism code 84346001 for Salmonella Bardo due to the precise taxonomic naming. It avoids broader parent concepts and does not suggest sibling serovars. No clinical attributes are included, so the mapping remains at the organism level."
444301000124103,Methionine and valine-free and low in isoleucine and threonine formula (product),Feeding plan includes a formula with no methionine or valine and low isoleucine/threonine,"This care plan entry describes a formula product that contains no methionine or valine and has low levels of isoleucine and threonine. The category is Product. It corresponds precisely to the Methionine and valine-free and low in isoleucine and threonine formula concept. More general formulas or products that specify only one amino acid restriction would be under-specified. “No” is synonymous with “free,” and “low” is retained, ensuring the correct concept selection."
448623004,Primary closed reduction of fracture and skeletal traction (procedure),"Patient statement: ""They did a primary closed reduction of my fracture and put me in skeletal traction.""",The patient-reported statement conveys that the primary procedure was a closed reduction of a fracture with skeletal traction applied. This remains a Procedure. SNOMED CT code 448623004 is the exact match because it requires both closed reduction and skeletal traction under the primary designation. Lay phrasing ('put me in skeletal traction') is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of traction application and does not modify attributes. Concepts lacking either component or using different methods would be less appropriate.
60259009,Onychotillomania (finding),Onychotillomania (clinical finding),"This phrasing clarifies the SNOMED CT category as a Clinical finding and refers to the same phenomenon of persistent nail picking. It cleanly maps to SCTID 60259009 without implying a psychiatric disorder diagnosis or adding extraneous attributes. Parent concepts such as 'nail abnormality' are too general, and sibling concepts like nail biting or skin picking do not match nail picking behavior, confirming the specificity of this code."
228182003,Sock garters (physical object),Accessory item: sock garters,"This states the object as sock garters and labels it an accessory item, which is consistent with its nature without introducing nonessential attributes. The focus is a physical object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. Sock garters (228182003) is the precise code as the entry names the specific accessory for socks. Generic accessory categories or sibling concepts (e.g., garter belt) lack the sock-specific detail and would be less accurate."
61061000,Colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage assay (procedure),Granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming unit testing,"The phrase identifies testing of GM colony-forming units, synonymous with a CFU-GM assay. As a laboratory Procedure, it maps to SCTID 61061000. The entry is specific and does not introduce result values, timing, specimen, or indications. Parent concepts without GM specificity and sibling CFU assays for other lineages would not match this exact wording, supporting the CFU-GM procedure code."
394789000,Day center managed by local authority (environment),Patient states: at a council-operated day centre,"As a patient-reported statement, it still names the environment as a council-operated day centre, which is a day centre managed by a local authority, matching Day center managed by local authority (environment) SCTID 394789000. Category: Environment or geographical location. “Council-operated” is equivalent to local authority-managed. The context does not add timing, purpose, or other attributes, and it avoids broader or alternative management concepts."
768465000,Product containing protein (product),Product specification indicates protein content,"Referencing the product’s specification to indicate protein content still denotes a product with protein included, mapping to 768465000 (Product containing protein). The entry does not specify measurement values, subtype, or use, so it is not an Observable or a dietary/therapeutic child concept. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling ingredient categories do not match. The phrasing is a documentation variant conveying the same concept as the preferred term."
1228941006,American Joint Committee on Cancer cT3c (qualifier value),AJCC cT3c designation for clinical T.,"The text assigns the AJCC clinical T designation cT3c, directly corresponding to the qualifier value AJCC cT3c (SCTID 1228941006). This avoids ambiguity with broader cT3 categories and excludes siblings such as cT3a/b, as well as pT stages. No extra attributes (site, edition, N/M) are included, making cT3c the exact concept required."
223999001,Part of North American country (geographic location),Birthplace documented: subnational area of a North American country,"The entry reflects a birthplace situated in a subnational portion of a North American country, without naming the specific area or altering attributes like time or severity. Within SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location and maps most precisely to 223999001. It clearly excludes the whole-country parent concept and avoids the specificity that would push coding to named child entities. It also distinguishes North America, preventing misclassification to sibling concepts tied to other continents."
703123005,Rilpivirine (substance),Rilpivirine (antiretroviral drug substance),"The entry clarifies rilpivirine as an antiretroviral drug substance, keeping the focus on the chemical entity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This matches SCTID 703123005, since no reference is made to dose, route, salt, or brand. Class-level parent concepts are too general, and product siblings would be more appropriate only if formulation details were included. The added descriptor does not change the underlying substance identity."
299142008,Increased active range of thumb flexion (finding),Increased active range of thumb flexion,"The entry explicitly states an increased (greater than normal) active range of motion in the plane of thumb flexion, which is a clinical finding rather than a disorder or procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This maps most precisely to SNOMED CT concept 'Increased active range of thumb flexion (finding)' (299142008) because it includes the key attributes: increased, active, thumb, and flexion. Broader parent concepts like 'Finding of thumb range of motion' lack the increased and active qualifiers, and sibling concepts such as 'Increased passive range of thumb flexion' or 'Decreased active range of thumb flexion' would misstate the mode or direction. The wording aligns exactly with the concept without adding cause, laterality, or severity."
12399011000119104,Neglect of elder (event),Case management: elder neglect,"This entry places elder neglect within case management documentation while retaining the core event concept. The main concept is neglect of an elder, a social maltreatment event. In SNOMED CT, this is categorized as an Event and is best coded as Neglect of elder (event), SCTID 12399011000119104. Parent terms like Neglect (event) are nonspecific, and siblings (Abuse of elder, Self-neglect of elder) address different maltreatment types or perpetrators. The case management context does not add attributes, ensuring the specific elder-neglect event code fits."
251912004,Forced inspired volume in 1 second (observable entity),Inspiratory forced volume at 1 second,"A re-ordered synonym that conveys the same measurement: the volume during forced inspiration evaluated at one second. Main concept: FIV1. Category: Observable entity. This is equivalent to 'forced inspired volume in 1 second' and avoids any additional attributes. It is not better mapped to generic parent observables, nor to siblings like FEV1 or inspiratory capacity, which reflect different physiologic parameters."
414295008,Freeway on-ramp (environment),Scene type: freeway on-ramp,"The phrase 'scene type' is common in records to indicate environment and does not introduce extra clinical attributes. It specifies a freeway on-ramp, an Environment concept. It excludes broader freeway settings or off-ramps, supporting 'Freeway on-ramp (environment)' as the most precise code."
258428005,Products of conception tissue specimen (specimen),Accessioned specimen—products of conception tissue,"This indicates an accessioned specimen whose material is products of conception tissue, which is the SNOMED CT Specimen 258428005. The accessioning status is workflow context and does not alter the specimen’s identity. Parent/sibling concepts (e.g., generic specimen or specific component tissues) are less appropriate because the entry is explicitly POC tissue."
1304041006,Digital flow morphology technique (qualifier value),Technique employed: digital flow morphology,"The phrase presents digital flow morphology as the technique employed, directly corresponding to Digital flow morphology technique (SCTID 1304041006). It does not specify modality, anatomy, timing, or procedure type, maintaining a pure technique qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings that add modality or context would be overly specific. The wording uses a synonymous framing that does not alter the semantic scope of the technique."
282929007,Ability to move from lying to sitting (observable entity),Ability to transition from supine to sitting,"This statement describes the observable capacity to change from supine (lying) to sitting, which is the exact positional change represented by the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 282929007 is the precise match. Using “supine” is a clinically standard synonym for lying and does not add attributes like assistance or success. More general transfer observables or different transitions (e.g., supine to stand) would be less precise, and findings that indicate able or unable would represent a measured value rather than the observable itself."
242621007,Bite of lion (event),Bite by lion,"This wording conveys that a lion was the source of the bite, describing the external event. It fits SNOMED CT’s Event category and maps directly to Bite of lion (event), SCTID 242621007. The phrasing does not introduce location, acuity, timing, or injury terminology, avoiding misclassification as a disorder or a broader animal-attack concept. It is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term without changing code selection."
223577004,Tajikistan (geographic location),Tajikistan,"The main concept referenced is the country Tajikistan as a geographic location with no added qualifiers or relations. In SNOMED CT, this maps precisely to Tajikistan (geographic location) SCTID 223577004 within the Location/Geographic location hierarchy. A broader parent such as Geographic location would be too general, and child concepts (e.g., cities or regions within Tajikistan) are not indicated. Sibling countries are not referenced. The wording is the preferred name and cleanly represents the standalone location value, so this is the most specific and correct code."
31433007,Cortisol acetyltransferase (substance),Cortisol acetyltransferase term used,"The phrasing indicates usage of the term identifying the substance cortisol acetyltransferase, with no added attributes or roles. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the exact match Cortisol acetyltransferase (substance) [31433007]. Broader parents such as Enzyme (substance) or Acetyltransferase (substance) are too general, and siblings like cortisol or enzyme activity would not correspond to the named enzyme substance."
1255363008,Laparoscopic end-to-end anastomosis of fallopian tube (procedure),Laparoscopic tubotubal end-to-end anastomosis,"This indicates an end-to-end anastomosis between two segments of the fallopian tube (tubotubal) performed laparoscopically. It is a Procedure. “Tubotubal” clarifies that both joined ends are tubal, which is consistent with end-to-end anastomosis. Parent terms missing approach or siblings like open tubal anastomosis are less appropriate. No mention of laterality, reversal, or other modifiers is included, supporting selection of the laparoscopic end-to-end fallopian tube anastomosis concept."
217877008,Accidental kicking against pedestrian conveyance (event),EMS report: accidental kicking against pedestrian conveyance,"This EMS documentation states that the event involved accidental kicking against a pedestrian conveyance, with no additional details such as injuries or location. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The precise match is SCTID 217877008. Broader parents would be less specific; child concepts naming the conveyance type are not indicated; sibling mechanisms or intentionality do not align with the explicit accidental kick."
432713006,Legionella rowbothamii (organism),Organism referenced: L. rowbothamii,"This text references the organism using the accepted abbreviation L. rowbothamii, with no added clinical state or result. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 432713006 corresponds exactly to Legionella rowbothamii. Mapping to genus-level parents or other species would not match the specific abbreviation. The abbreviation is a clinically safe synonym that preserves the concept selection."
257611004,Farm house (environment),Farm house,"The entry names the environmental setting explicitly as a farm house. The main concept is a place/setting, with no additional attributes such as timing, cause, or severity. Category: Environment or geographical location (Environment). SNOMED CT 257611004 ‘Farm house (environment)’ is the most precise match because it denotes a farmhouse as an environmental context rather than a structure or a broader farm. More general parents like ‘House (environment)’ are too broad, and siblings like ‘Farm (environment)’ or ‘Barn (environment)’ are incorrect. The wording ‘farm house’ is a clinically equivalent form of ‘farmhouse’ without altering the concept."
346405008,Dog allergy vaccine (product),Allergy vaccine for dog allergy,"The wording states an allergy vaccine with the specific indication of dog allergy, which is a pharmaceutical/biologic product. This is best coded as Dog allergy vaccine. A generic parent like Allergy vaccine (product) omits the allergen detail, while siblings for other allergen targets do not apply. The entry avoids route, dose, and administration action, keeping it at the correct product granularity."
709218007,Antigen of Bacillus anthracis cell wall (substance),Analyte: Bacillus anthracis cell wall antigen,"This entry names the analyte as the Bacillus anthracis cell wall antigen, a substance. The term “analyte” is a role/context descriptor and does not alter the identity of the substance. The most precise code is SNOMED CT 709218007. Parent concepts covering any Bacillus anthracis antigen would be less specific, and sibling concepts (e.g., capsular or secreted antigens) do not match the cell wall origin stated here. No additional attributes like results or timing are introduced."
702148003,Neovaginoplasty tensioning device (physical object),Neovaginoplasty tensioner device,"The synonym 'tensioner device' is a clinically safe equivalence for 'tensioning device' and continues to specify the neovaginoplasty use. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 702148003 best fits because the device is uniquely tied to neovaginoplasty. Broader parents (e.g., surgical instrument/device) lack the procedure-specific qualifier, and siblings like 'vaginoplasty tensioner' would not capture the 'neo' reconstructive context. No extraneous attributes are present."
75966000,Steroid-lactonase (substance),Steroid-lactonase enzyme,"Adding “enzyme” does not alter the identity of the substance; steroid-lactonase is an enzyme and the phrase remains a synonym referring to the same substance. No clinical action or context is asserted beyond naming the substance. Category is Substance. The precise match is SNOMED CT 75966000. Mapping to a broader parent (e.g., Enzyme (substance)) would lose specificity, and other steroid-related enzymes would be incorrect."
421676007,District of Canadian territory (geographic location),District entity of a Canadian territory,"This wording frames the district as an entity within the administrative structure of a Canadian territory. The concept is a geographic location, fitting the Location (Geographic location) category. SCTID 421676007 is the correct code, as it is specific to districts of Canadian territories. Parent concepts such as District (geographic location) are too broad, and siblings like Municipality or Region of Canadian territory are different administrative units. The term “entity” does not alter the level or jurisdiction, maintaining equivalence to the preferred concept."
768623004,Product containing ketone (product),Medication list: product containing ketone,"In a medication list context, this notes a product whose ingredient includes ketone, with no explicit route, dose, or form specified. Category: Product. It matches “Product containing ketone” (768623004) precisely. Assigning only a parent concept would be too general, and selecting a child for a single named ketone would be over-specific. The context (“Medication list”) does not alter the meaning; it remains a ketone-containing product."
183067004,High protein diet education (procedure),Initial visit: high-protein diet education performed.,"The entry states that education focused on the high-protein diet was performed during the initial visit, keeping the emphasis on education. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It precisely maps to 183067004 due to the defined diet topic and educational action. Parent concepts (diet education) are too broad; sibling diet education concepts do not match the high-protein focus. The timing (‘initial visit’) is contextual and does not change the core procedure."
7312001,Rhodomyrtus (organism),Taxonomic classification: Rhodomyrtus,"The phrase conveys that the identified taxon is Rhodomyrtus, a genus-level organism. This fits the Organism category concept Rhodomyrtus (organism) [7312001]. It does not specify species or imply any clinical event, therefore sibling genera or child species would be incorrect. The wording 'taxonomic classification' contextualizes usage without altering the underlying organism concept."
440091008,"Finding related to blood, organ, or tissue donation (finding)","Observation related to blood, organ, or tissue donation (clinical finding)","The entry names an observation and clarifies it as a clinical finding related to donation involving blood, organs, or tissue, with no extra qualifiers. This is a Clinical finding. SCTID 440091008 is the exact umbrella for donation-related findings and fits the generic scope here. Child or sibling concepts such as donor status, evaluation for donation, or consent processes would need explicit mention and therefore are not appropriate. 'Observation' is a common synonym for a clinical finding and does not change the code selection."
223628004,Tonga (geographic location),Tonga (country),"The phrase explicitly clarifies that Tonga is a country, aligning exactly with the SNOMED CT concept for the nation. Category: Geographic location (Location). This is the most precise match for 223628004 because it identifies the sovereign country rather than a broader region or sublocation. Parent concepts (e.g., 'Country (geographic location)') are too generic, and no child entities (cities or districts) or sibling countries are mentioned. The parenthetical descriptor is a neutral clarification, not an added attribute."
300934004,Family history: Hypothyroidism (situation),Intake family history includes hypothyroidism,"The intake note confirms hypothyroidism is part of the family history, not the patient’s current condition. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. This should be coded to Family history: Hypothyroidism (situation) SCTID 300934004. Coding to Hypothyroidism (disorder) would be incorrect because the subject is relatives, and broader family-history concepts for thyroid disease would be insufficiently specific to hypothyroidism."
466329007,Bed/chair electric massager (physical object),Electric chair/bed massage accessory,"The entry specifies an electric massage accessory intended for a chair or bed, which corresponds to a bed/chair electric massager. The central concept is a physical object; attributes are electric power and chair/bed suitability without adding features like heating or handheld operation. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and SCTID 466329007 is the best fit because it captures the accessory nature for bed/chair as an electric massager. A broader parent like “Electric massage accessory” would lack the furniture context. Sibling concepts like “Massage chair” imply integrated hardware, which is not described. The term “accessory” reflects an add-on device form but remains semantically equivalent to the massager intended for bed/chair and does not change code selection."
391949002,Non-contact tonometer (physical object),Equipment available: non-contact tonometer,"Availability context is provided, but the entry’s core concept is the non-contact tonometer device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device), with Non-contact tonometer (391949002) being the precise match. General tonometer parents lack modality specificity; contact method siblings are inconsistent with 'non-contact.' The wording avoids procedural or performance attributes."
423109005,Fulica gigantea (organism),Patient mentions “giant coot”,"A patient-stated mention of 'giant coot' points to the organism Fulica gigantea and introduces no clinical condition or exposure detail. The concept is an organism species; SNOMED category is Organism. SCTID 423109005 fits the specific species. Coding to broader coots or genus-level taxa would be less precise, and sibling species would be wrong. The common name is a valid synonym that does not change the code."
272499001,Geographical waterform feature (environment),Environmental element: geographical waterform feature,"‘Element’ here denotes a component of the environment and is paired with ‘geographical waterform feature,’ which matches Geographical waterform feature (environment) [272499001] in the Environment category. No subtype, exposure, or location attribute is included. Parent geographic feature concepts would omit the water-specific qualifier, and children (e.g., River, Ocean) would be too specific, so this concept is appropriate."
410543007,Did not attend (qualifier value),Reported did not attend,"This narrative phrasing indicates that the status reported is non-attendance, which is a qualifier value. It maps to Did not attend (qualifier value) [410543007]. The entry refrains from specifying reasons, times, or event types, avoiding situation-level or administrative concepts. Sibling statuses such as attended, cancelled, or left without being seen are not implied. The synonymical phrasing does not change the code selection."
309984004,General surgical department (environment),Department: General Surgery,"As a label-value format, this indicates the environment as a department with a general surgery focus. This matches SNOMED CT 309984004 (Environment). The label 'Department' confines the concept to departmental level and avoids adding timing or care episode details. Parent or sibling concepts involving wards, units, or services are not implied, making the department code the most precise match."
47501007,Chronic active (qualifier value),Follow-up: chronic active,"During follow-up, the course is described as “chronic active,” which matches the intended qualifier value. The main concept is the clinical course descriptor. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value (47501007). This is more precise than parent or sibling qualifiers because it conveys both chronicity and current activity. The entry avoids introducing severity, etiology, or condition specifics."
65316004,Inferior radioulnar joint structure (body structure),Imaging annotation: distal radioulnar joint,The entry labels the anatomical structure on imaging as the distal radioulnar joint. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This maps directly to SCTID 65316004. More general joint structures or the proximal radioulnar joint would be miscoded. The wording does not introduce any diagnostic findings or laterality; it remains strictly anatomical.
122590004,Serum specimen from patient (specimen),Patient serum sample (specimen),"Here, 'sample' and '(specimen)' reinforce that the entity is a specimen of serum from a patient, mapping directly to SNOMED CT 122590004 (Specimen). It excludes parent (unspecified source) and siblings (e.g., plasma specimen from patient). The synonyms 'sample'/'specimen' are interchangeable in this context and do not alter attributes."
76516006,Entire costal groove of eleventh rib (body structure),Entire costal groove of rib eleven,"This entry uses the word form 'rib eleven' and explicitly states 'entire costal groove,' naming the whole anatomical substructure of the eleventh rib. It is a Body structure and fits SNOMED CT 76516006. More general parent concepts fail to convey the whole extent, and siblings for other ribs would mismatch the rib number. The phrasing adds no laterality, severity, or associated findings, so the exact code remains 76516006."
722244000,Pressure ratio (property) (qualifier value),Computed property: pressure ratio,"The wording indicates that the computed property is 'pressure ratio,' emphasizing a property designation rather than a value or finding. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, describing the nature of the computed attribute. SCTID 722244000 fits because it specifies the property as a ratio between pressures. A general 'Ratio (property)' parent would be insufficiently specific, and sibling properties like 'Pressure gradient (property)' denote subtraction-based relationships, not ratios. The term 'computed property' is a contextual synonym that keeps the concept at the qualifier level without adding measurement details."
242902001,Sat on by assailant (event),"Per triage note, assailant sat on pt","This indicates triage documentation of an assailant sitting on the patient, which aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 242902001. Main concept: sat-on by assailant; the source (triage) is contextual and not a clinical attribute. SNOMED CT category: Event. It is more specific than generic assault and does not imply other actions like pushing or kicking. Abbreviating “patient” to “pt” does not alter the concept."
419305002,Streptococcus pneumoniae Danish serotype 12F (organism),Identified organism label—Streptococcus pneumoniae Danish serotype 12F,"This entry presents an organism label, explicitly naming S. pneumoniae with Danish serotype 12F. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 419305002 is exact for this designation, maintaining serotype specificity. Parent concepts (species only) are too broad, and sibling serotype concepts (other serotypes or non-Danish) would be inaccurate. The statement is a taxonomy label and does not assert disease or detection."
465115009,Assistive scissors (physical object),Assistive cutting scissors,"The phrase 'assistive cutting scissors' describes scissors intended to assist with cutting, retaining the same meaning as assistive scissors. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This maps to SCTID 465115009 because it conveys assistance/adaptation without specifying a subtype or alternative purpose like surgery. Parent 'Scissors' is too generic; siblings (e.g., surgical scissors) or children (specific adaptive mechanisms) are not implied."
214279005,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision, on highway, between motor vehicle and fallen stone, traffic sign, tree or utility pole, motor cyclist injured (event)","Highway RTC, car vs tree; motorcyclist the injured party.","The entry details a road traffic collision (RTC) on a highway, involving a car (motor vehicle) versus a tree, with the injured party being a motorcyclist. This corresponds precisely to the Event SCTID 214279005. Parent or sibling concepts without object specification, different objects, or different injured parties would be less appropriate. “RTC” is a standard synonym and does not affect code selection."
472894002,Swab from cornea (specimen),Swab of cornea specimen,"The entry describes the specimen as a swab of the cornea, which matches SNOMED CT 'Swab from cornea (specimen)' SCTID 472894002. Category: Specimen. This construction is a clinically acceptable paraphrase of the preferred term, maintains the corneal source and swab method, and avoids broader or different specimen types. No additional attributes such as laterality or test intent are implied."
58027005,Genus Haematopinus (organism),Haematopinus at genus rank,"The wording specifies Haematopinus and its taxonomic rank as genus, which pinpoints the intended level. The core concept is the organism genus Haematopinus with no additional attributes such as species, host, or disease. In SNOMED CT, the category is Organism, and code 58027005 exactly represents “Genus Haematopinus.” Parent taxa (higher-ranking lice categories) would be too broad, and child species would be too narrow and not stated. Sibling genera are not suggested. This is a synonymous paraphrase that maintains the same coding as the preferred term."
18980008,Red blood cell antibody detection with saline (procedure),Saline red cell antibody detection procedure,"By stating “saline red cell antibody detection procedure,” the entry clearly indicates a Procedure where red cell antibodies are detected via the saline technique. It maps directly to 18980008 and not to broader detection (no method stated) or alternate methods like antiglobulin testing. It avoids extra attributes (results, indications), maintaining precise concept equivalence."
445061001,Preoperative counseling (procedure),Counseling before operation,"The concept is counseling provided before an operation, with no unrelated attributes. This falls under Procedure. “Before operation” is synonymous with preoperative, so this corresponds to Preoperative counseling (procedure) 445061001. A generic counseling code lacks the preoperative context, and cousins like preoperative evaluation or consent acquisition involve different activities not mentioned. Hence, the designated preoperative counseling procedure code is the best match."
297617008,Palaung language (qualifier value),Listed language: Palaung,"This indicates that the listed language is Palaung, mapping exactly to Palaung language (SCTID 297617008) as a Qualifier value. There are no inferred attributes such as primary status, preferred language, or ability level. A broader language parent would be too generic, and sibling language concepts are not referenced."
710879002,Education of parent about caregiver child attachment (procedure),Provided educational materials and verbal instruction to the parent about caregiver–child attachment,"The entry notes both materials and verbal instruction provided to a parent, all focused on caregiver–child attachment. The primary concept is education of the parent about attachment. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 710879002 is most appropriate since the mode of delivery (materials and verbal) still constitutes education on caregiver–child attachment for a parent. Parent education general or counseling concepts would be broader or different. The synonymy of instruction/education is maintained without introducing other attributes."
128163008,Tissue specimen from endometrium (specimen),Source labeled: endometrium tissue specimen,"This entry reflects labeling information, identifying the specimen as a tissue specimen from the endometrium. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It corresponds to SCTID 128163008 by specifying both specimen type and anatomical source. It avoids procedural terminology, so child concepts like biopsy specimen from endometrium do not apply; parent concepts lacking site specificity are less precise."
289807008,Finding of consistency of cervical mucous (finding),Pelvic exam: cervical mucus consistency finding,"The phrase specifies that during pelvic exam the finding relates to cervical mucus consistency, which maps precisely to 289807008. Category: Clinical finding. The exam context does not alter the attribute, and no particular consistency value is given, avoiding more specific children. The emphasis remains on consistency rather than alternative attributes, making parent or sibling codes less precise."
226383006,Tea intake (observable entity),Dietary intake: tea,"As a documentation heading, 'Dietary intake: tea' identifies the specific observable being captured within a nutrition/diet context, still without amounts, frequency, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and Tea intake (observable entity) [226383006] is the exact fit. Mapping to a parent such as general dietary beverage intake would lose specificity, and sibling findings like 'tea drinking' imply a behavioral state rather than the variable being observed."
309636006,History of hospital admission in last year for hyperglycemic disorder (situation),Hospital admission in the previous year for hyperglycemia noted.,"This entry states that a hospital admission in the previous year occurred for hyperglycemia. Attributes are timeframe (previous year), setting (hospital admission), and condition (hyperglycemia). The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It maps to 309636006 exactly. Parent terms lacking the specified reason or timeframe are too general, and child terms specifying DKA or HHS admissions are not supported. The term “hyperglycemia” is clinically equivalent to hyperglycemic disorder, and no additional attributes are introduced."
735164004,Quinine benzoate (substance),Substance confirmed: quinine benzoate,"The phrase confirms the identity of the substance as quinine benzoate and does not introduce clinical actions or product forms. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 735164004 matches the specific chemical salt, distinguishing it from parent quinine and other quinine salts. No attributes like strength, formulation, or timing are added, so the substance concept remains the best match."
323031001,Entire lymphoid tissues of gastrointestinal tract (body structure),All lymphoid tissues of the GI tract,"The wording ‘all’ conveys totality of lymphoid tissues in the GI tract without adding any clinical states. Main concept: entire GI lymphoid tissue collection. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 323031001 is ideal because it denotes the entirety of GI lymphoid tissues. Parent body-structure concepts that don’t specify completeness are less exact; children focused on a single site (e.g., appendix lymphoid tissue) would be too narrow. ‘All’ functions as an equivalent to ‘entire’ for anatomical scope."
264739002,Medial rotation - action (qualifier value),Movement type—medial rotation,"The entry identifies the movement type as 'medial rotation', capturing the action qualifier for rotation toward the midline. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value (action), aligning with SCTID 264739002. The description remains general and directional, avoiding body site or procedural timing details. A parent such as 'Rotation - action' would be less precise due to missing directionality, and siblings like 'lateral rotation' would be contrary. No anatomical site is specified, so child concepts are not appropriate."
368309001,Entire head of phalanx of index finger (body structure),Anatomic site: head of index phalanx,"This contextualizes the structure as an anatomic site but still clearly identifies the 'head' of an index finger phalanx. It remains a Body structure concept and best matches SCTID 368309001. The lack of phalanx level details prevents mapping to narrower child concepts, and the inclusion of 'head' avoids mapping to broader parent structures."
411759003,Pinus edulis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Pinus edulis allergen extract (diagnostic),"This entry states an allergen extract of Pinus edulis with diagnostic intent, which is semantically identical to the preferred concept. The main concept is the diagnostic allergen extract of this species. The SNOMED category is Product. It is more specific than the parent because it names the source and does not add details that would point to sibling concepts like different species or therapeutic extracts. It maps uniquely to 411759003."
423569001,Merops ornatus (organism),Avian species: Merops ornatus,"This phrasing identifies Merops ornatus as an avian species, which remains a precise reference to the species-level Organism concept SCTID 423569001. The modifier 'avian' does not change code selection; it reinforces biological class without adding clinical attributes. Parent concepts (birds) would be too general, and other bee-eater species are excluded."
705505005,Gastrointestinal detoxifier (physical object),Gastrointestinal detoxifier equipment,"Using 'equipment' underscores the item as a tangible resource, a physical object used for GI detoxification. This is consistent with the SNOMED CT Physical object category and matches Gastrointestinal detoxifier (physical object). The wording avoids introducing administration, indications, or pharmacologic substance characteristics, so it does not map to a procedure or drug. 'Equipment' is a clinically acceptable synonym for a device/supply, and does not change the code selection. More general equipment categories or different GI-related devices would be either too broad or misaligned with the detoxifier intent."
1371382007,Route of vaccine product administration not appropriate (event),Inappropriate route of vaccine product administration,"The entry explicitly states that the route used to administer a vaccine product was inappropriate, which directly aligns with SNOMED CT concept 1371382007. The main medical concept is a vaccine administration event characterized by an unsuitable route. SNOMED CT category: Event. This is the most precise match because it specifies the vaccine context and the route aspect without adding further attributes. Broader parents like general administration errors or wrong route for non-vaccine medicines would be less specific, and children specifying a particular route (e.g., subcutaneous vs intramuscular) would be too detailed. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym of the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
772815008,Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease fibrosis score (observable entity),NAFLD fibrosis score assessment,"This phrase refers to the NAFLD fibrosis score in the context of assessment, but still denotes the observable score itself, without adding values or timing. The concept type is Observable entity, corresponding to SCTID 772815008. It clearly distinguishes from procedural concepts (e.g., ordering a test) and from other scores, making parent and sibling concepts less precise."
37291000087108,Xerochrysium xerophilum (organism),Recorded organism name: Xerochrysium xerophilum,"The entry documents the organism name as Xerochrysium xerophilum, with no clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This matches SCTID 37291000087108 at the species level. Parent concepts such as the genus Xerochrysium or general fungi are overly broad, and there is no child-level detail like strains. 'Recorded' indicates documentation only, not a finding, infection, or location, ensuring the organism concept remains the most accurate code."
846610005,Community occupational therapy clinic (environment),Community occupational therapy clinic,"The entry names a specific healthcare environment: a clinic providing occupational therapy in a community setting. The main concept is the location itself, not an organization or service, and it includes the explicit attributes “community,” “occupational therapy,” and “clinic.” This aligns with the SNOMED CT category Environment, and the most precise match is Community occupational therapy clinic (environment), SCTID 846610005. More general parents such as Occupational therapy clinic (environment) lack the community qualifier, and siblings like hospital-based or school-based occupational therapy clinics are not indicated by the wording. No additional attributes (e.g., timing, severity, cause) are introduced."
71997007,Noon (qualifier value),Symptom began at noon,"The phrase provides clinical context about a symptom but focuses on the onset time “noon.” SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. Noon (71997007) is the precise match as it denotes the exact 12:00 midday start point. Parent time-of-day concepts are too general, and siblings like “Morning” or “Afternoon” imply periods rather than the specific noon instant."
119379005,Specimen from stomach (specimen),Clinical note: stomach specimen sent for analysis,"This clinical note indicates that a specimen, identified by its source as the stomach, was sent for analysis, without specifying specimen type or collection method. The main concept is a specimen from the stomach. Category: Specimen. The correct mapping is SNOMED CT SCTID 119379005. Adding a child concept would require details like biopsy, aspirate, or fluid, which are not present. Parent concepts are too general because the stomach is explicitly named. The phrase “sent for analysis” provides context but does not introduce attributes that alter the specimen concept or code selection."
51479008,Skin structure of dorsal surface of toe (body structure),Skin structure on dorsum of toe,"The entry explicitly references the skin structure on the dorsum (dorsal surface) of a toe, with no added details such as laterality or disease. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps precisely to Skin structure of dorsal surface of toe (SCTID 51479008), identifying both tissue type (skin) and site (toe dorsum). Parent concepts like Structure of toe dorsum are too general, and siblings like Skin of plantar toe are incorrect for the stated location. The phrase is a clear synonym, preserving equivalence with the preferred term."
223533006,Comoros islands (geographic location),Comoros archipelago,"The wording explicitly identifies the archipelago named Comoros, which aligns to a geographic location concept. In SNOMED CT, the category is Location, and SCTID 223533006 precisely represents the Comoros islands archipelago. The term does not imply national governance (country concept) or specify one island, so parents like generic geographic locations are too broad and siblings such as the country or a single island are not suitable."
463182000,Polybutester suture (physical object),Operative supplies: polybutester suture,"The operative supplies context lists a polybutester suture; context does not change the device’s identity. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This entry directly matches Polybutester suture (physical object), SCTID 463182000, because it names the suture and its material. A parent concept like generic suture is too broad, and siblings naming other materials are incorrect. No additional attributes are stated."
122701006,Specimen from uterine cervix obtained by radical hysterectomy (specimen),Pathology: uterine cervix specimen (radical hysterectomy),"In a pathology reporting context, the entry states a specimen from the uterine cervix and clarifies it was obtained by radical hysterectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This matches SCTID 122701006 exactly, as it contains both the anatomical site and the acquisition procedure. Parent or sibling concepts lacking the radical hysterectomy qualifier, or implying different collection methods, would not be as specific. The use of 'Pathology:' is contextual and does not change the underlying specimen concept."
81184002,R wave feature (observable entity),QRS R-wave feature,"This specifies that the feature pertains to the R wave within the QRS complex, which is the standard physiologic context, without adding a specific attribute or value. The main concept is the R wave feature. Category: Observable entity. SNOMED CT 81184002 is ideal because it targets the R component specifically. A parent concept like 'QRS complex feature' would be broader than the R deflection alone, and child concepts like 'R wave amplitude' or 'R wave duration' would be more specific than indicated. The phrasing maintains equivalence to the preferred term."
470372005,Gastrojejunostomy tube (physical object),Inventory item—GJ tube,"An inventory-style label still denotes the physical object: the gastrojejunostomy tube. Category: Physical object (Device). The abbreviation is a clinically equivalent synonym and maps to SCTID 470372005. Broader parent devices would lack specificity, and child concepts tied to insertion technique or design features are not indicated, keeping this correctly at the base GJ tube level."
242680005,Accidental suffocation due to lack of oxygen in storage tank (event),Accidental asphyxia in storage tank because of oxygen deprivation,This phrasing describes an accidental asphyxia event in a storage tank caused by oxygen deprivation. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 242680005 and is categorized as an Event. It does not add any extraneous attributes such as work-relatedness or temporal context. Broader 'accidental suffocation' lacks the specified cause and environment; sibling concepts like 'accidental suffocation in unspecified confined space' are less precise. 'Asphyxia' and 'oxygen deprivation' are standard clinical equivalents of suffocation due to lack of oxygen.
702922005,Speech and language therapy clinic (environment),Practice site: speech and language therapy clinic,"‘Practice site’ is another term for the care environment, specified as speech and language therapy clinic. The entry remains an environment description, avoiding procedural or service-level concepts. Parent concepts like general practice site are too broad, and siblings of other therapy clinics are inaccurate. The synonym retains the same meaning, justifying use of 702922005."
251868007,kt/V (observable entity),Kt/V index,"‘Index’ is commonly used to denote a dimensionless calculated value; here it refers to the Kt/V adequacy metric. Category: Observable entity. The entry remains focused on the Kt/V observable and does not add attributes such as modality, timing, or variant, so the general kt/V concept SCTID 251868007 is most appropriate. More specific child concepts (e.g., eKt/V, spKt/V) are not implicated."
247316009,"Local position sense, function (observable entity)",Follow-up review item: local position sense function,"This is a follow-up heading referencing the observable entity of local position sense function, free of results or qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. It aligns with 247316009 rather than general proprioception or other sensory functions (movement, vibration). No joint specificity is implied, so child concepts are excluded. The phrasing is context-only and retains the same clinical concept."
411425001,Feverfew allergen patch test product (product),Patch test panel includes feverfew allergen product,"Main concept: within a patch test panel, the included product is the feverfew allergen. Explicit attribute: patch test context; no extra attributes like concentration or result. SNOMED CT category: Product. The phrase identifies the exact allergen product, mapping to SCTID 411425001. A parent concept would be too broad (panel allergens in general), while siblings are other listed allergens not specified. No procedure is claimed—only product inclusion."
113530009,Capnocytophaga cynodegmi (organism),Scientific name recorded: Capnocytophaga cynodegmi,"This entry states the scientific name Capnocytophaga cynodegmi. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The scientific naming focuses exclusively on the species taxon, supporting use of 113530009. Parent concepts (genus or general bacterium) would be less specific, and this does not denote a clinical finding, infection, or a more specific strain."
717931007,Mild thinness in adulthood (finding),Mild thinness of adulthood,"This wording conveys the same idea: thinness present in adulthood at a mild level, with no added qualifiers. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 717931007 is the correct selection because it includes both the adult age group and mild severity. Broader adult thinness or different severity classifications would be less precise. The phrase is a stylistic synonym consistent with the preferred term."
12161000119107,Non infant excessive crying (finding),Excessive crying reported in a non-infant,"The documentation context (reported) does not alter the clinical finding; it remains excessive crying in a non-infant. This maps precisely to “Non infant excessive crying (finding)” (SCTID 12161000119107), which is a Clinical finding. The age specification distinguishes it from both the generic parent and the infant-specific sibling concepts. No timing, cause, or severity beyond “excessive” is included."
182718004,Mountain resort sanatorium (environment),Occupational location: mountain resort sanatorium,"The text identifies an occupational location as a mountain resort sanatorium, which is an environmental setting. This remains within the SNOMED CT Environment category and matches SCTID 182718004. Parents that are more general (only 'Sanatorium' or only 'Mountain resort') are insufficiently specific, and sibling environments (e.g., seaside resort sanatorium) would not match. The occupational context label does not introduce a different attribute; it simply situates the environment without altering the concept."
223669008,Luxembourg (geographic location),Address location: Luxembourg,"The phrase denotes a location used in addressing, but the core concept is the place name Luxembourg, with no extra qualifiers that would change the coding. This aligns with Luxembourg (geographic location), SCTID 223669008, categorized under Geographic location. Broader regional parents and child or sibling places (city, province, or other countries) are not implied. The context of “address” does not transform the concept into a person attribute or event; it remains a geographic location."
399069006,Dying process (observable entity),Physician note: dying process,"Within physician documentation, the concept mentioned is the dying process. No added attributes such as timing, severity, or cause are present. This is an Observable entity, representing an observable phenomenon rather than an intervention or diagnostic label. Parent observable categories would be too broad; sibling concepts like 'death' (event) or 'terminal management' (procedure) are not stated. Hence, Dying process is the most precise SNOMED CT match for this entry."
901005,Helicopter-based care (environment),Treatment occurred during helicopter-based care,"This statement focuses on treatment happening within the helicopter-based care setting, defining the environment. It is an Environment concept. It maps to Helicopter-based care (environment) SCTID 901005 because the care context is a helicopter. More generic parent care environments lack specificity, and siblings such as airplane-based care or hospital-based care are contradicted by the explicit helicopter reference. The phrase is a paraphrase of the same environment and does not introduce transport or emergency attributes."
438352005,Specimen from trachea obtained by excision (specimen),Specimen: trachea — excision,"This lab-style label indicates a specimen with the site (trachea) and method (excision). The concept aligns with a Specimen category and maps precisely to SCTID 438352005. Parent concepts lacking method detail are less specific, and sibling concepts specifying biopsy, brushing, or aspiration are not appropriate because the entry clearly states excision."
430705002,Family history of malignant neoplasm of ovary (situation),FHx—ovarian carcinoma.,"FHx denotes family history. 'Ovarian carcinoma' is a clinically equivalent synonym for malignant neoplasm of the ovary. The entry contains no details about degree of relation, timing, or associated factors, preserving the general family history context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 430705002 is the most precise selection; using a sibling like personal history of ovarian cancer would be incorrect, and broader family history of female genital organ malignancy would be less specific than the ovary."
266734005,Arm appliance (physical object),Arm appliance,"The entry states the physical object ""arm appliance"" without qualifiers or added attributes. The main medical concept is a generic appliance intended for the arm. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This matches SCTID 266734005 exactly because it denotes an arm-related appliance in general, not specifying type (e.g., sling, brace, cast, orthosis). Parent concepts like ""Appliance (physical object)"" are too broad, and child/sibling concepts such as ""Arm sling"" or ""Arm brace"" are too specific and not mentioned. No procedural, presence, laterality, timing, or functional attributes are introduced."
116471000119100,Blood test declined (situation),Patient refused blood test,"This entry conveys the patient’s refusal of a blood test, synonymous with declining, without adding cause or scope. It represents a Situation in SNOMED CT concerning the decision not to undergo a blood test. Blood test declined (situation) [116471000119100] fits best due to the explicit reference to a blood test. Parent concepts like Procedure declined are too generic, and Laboratory test declined is insufficiently specific to blood. There is no mention of any particular blood test subtype that would necessitate a child concept."
361892001,Entire tendon and tendon sheath within lower limb (body structure),Entire lower limb tenosynovium and tendons,"This entry uses 'tenosynovium' to denote tendon sheaths and combines it with tendons, indicating entirety within the lower limb. Attributes: region (lower limb), structures (tenosynovium/tendon sheath + tendons), completeness ('entire'). SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 361892001 is most precise, covering both anatomical components across the whole lower limb. Parent concepts are too general, while siblings for only tendon or only sheath are incomplete. 'Tenosynovium' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'tendon sheath', maintaining the intended anatomy without adding attributes."
410910001,Product containing ketolide (product),Ketolide-containing product,"This phrasing indicates a product that contains ketolide as its active component, avoiding details about dose, route, or brand. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It maps directly to “Product containing ketolide (product)” [410910001] because the focus is the presence of ketolide in the product. It is not broader (e.g., antiinfective product) nor narrower (e.g., telithromycin-containing product). The synonym “ketolide-containing” is clinically equivalent to “containing ketolide” and does not alter code selection."
168145009,Lymph specimen (specimen),Lymph specimen collected,"The entry documents collection of a lymph specimen, indicating the specimen type is lymph fluid. This is within the Specimen category. SCTID 168145009 (Lymph specimen) is the precise code since the material type is lymph, with no extra attributes about site or collection method. More general parents are insufficiently specific, and siblings such as lymph node tissue specimens would be inappropriate. The addition of “collected” is procedural context that does not change the specimen type."
60848008,Blood group antibody Lu17 (substance),Blood group antibody: anti-Lu17,"This phrase identifies the specific blood group antibody anti-Lu17, corresponding to SNOMED CT Blood group antibody Lu17 (60848008). The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The entry avoids introducing presence, testing outcome, or severity; it is strictly a substance identification. Parent concepts are generic and lack Lu17 specificity, while sibling antibodies target other antigens. Using 'anti-Lu17' is a clinically accepted synonym that does not change the coding."
429699009,History of malignant neoplasm of colon (situation),Patient has a history of colon carcinoma,"The statement clearly communicates a past colon carcinoma, synonymous with malignant neoplasm of colon. As a Situation with explicit context, the best match is 429699009. It avoids indicating current disease and does not add specific site segments, histology beyond carcinoma, or family history, so alternative parent/child/sibling codes would be less precise."
411808008,Periplaneta americana diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen product: Periplaneta americana,"The main idea is a diagnostic allergen product tied to the species Periplaneta americana. Category: Product. 'Diagnostic allergen product' is a synonymous phrasing for diagnostic allergen extract, maintaining the correct product class. It fits 411808008 because it identifies the species and diagnostic use without extra attributes. It does not suggest immunotherapy or mixed species, thus avoiding sibling concepts, and lacks formulation details that would suggest a child concept."
223514001,Tunisia (geographic location),Recorded country: Tunisia,"This denotes the recorded value for the country field as Tunisia, directly mapping to SNOMED CT 223514001. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographical location). The context term ‘recorded’ does not change the underlying concept to anything else. Parent categories are less specific, and child locales are not indicated, ensuring a precise country-level match."
28170009,Subcutaneous tissue structure of dorsal surface of fourth toe (body structure),Subdermal tissue of the dorsal surface of the fourth pedal digit,"‘Subdermal tissue’ is a clinically acceptable synonym for subcutaneous tissue, and ‘fourth pedal digit’ precisely denotes the fourth toe. The dorsal surface is specified. The concept is an anatomical body structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This mapping is exact for SCTID 28170009; broader parents (e.g., subdermal tissue of toe) or siblings (e.g., dorsal surface of fifth pedal digit) would not match the specified site."
275564008,History of gastrointestinal tract anastomosis (situation),Prior GI tract anastomosis documented,"The word 'Prior' signals historical context, and 'GI tract anastomosis' identifies the procedure domain. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. This maps to History of gastrointestinal tract anastomosis (SCTID 275564008) by stating a previous anastomosis in the gastrointestinal tract without additional qualifiers. A procedure concept would be incorrect because this is not a current intervention, and subtype-specific history codes would require more detail than provided. 'Documented' does not add clinical attributes; it confirms the history status."
305571007,Under care of oncology nurse (finding),Under care of oncology nurse.,"This statement conveys the clinical finding that the patient’s care relationship is with an oncology nurse. No timing, setting, or associated condition is introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, and the most precise match is Under care of oncology nurse (finding), SCTID 305571007, because it specifies the caregiver’s oncology nursing specialty. A broader parent like Under care of nurse would omit the oncology specialty, and siblings such as Under care of oncologist or Under care of oncology service would misidentify the caregiver type. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not alter code selection."
294269001,Allergy to mesna (finding),Medication reconciliation: mesna allergy,"This identifies mesna as an allergy during medication reconciliation, with no additional attributes specified. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is Allergy to mesna (finding), a Clinical finding. A parent concept like Medication allergy is less precise, and disorder-level adverse reaction concepts are not warranted because no event is described. The context of reconciliation is documentation-oriented and does not alter the underlying substance-specific allergy finding."
429836002,Specimen from maxillary sinus obtained by irrigation (specimen),Maxillary sinus rinse sample,"This indicates a sample obtained from a rinse of the maxillary sinus, where 'rinse' is a common synonym for irrigation. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and SCTID 429836002 is the most precise match because it encodes both site (maxillary sinus) and method (irrigation). It is more specific than parent 'specimen from maxillary sinus' and excludes sibling methods (aspiration, swab). The synonym 'rinse' does not alter the intended method."
215142005,"Pedal cycle accident involving collision between pedal cycle and pedestrian, pedestrian injured (event)",Accident report: collision between bicycle and pedestrian with pedestrian injury,This phrasing names the collision participants (bicycle/pedal cycle and pedestrian) and states the injured party is the pedestrian. This is a collision event without extra qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 215142005 precisely encodes this situation. Broader transport accident categories or alternate outcomes such as cyclist injured are less appropriate given the explicit pedestrian injury.
223405009,Outdoors area of home (environment),Outside area on home premises,"The main concept is the location defined as the outside (outdoor) area specifically on the home premises. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This aligns precisely with SCTID 223405009 by combining the outdoors qualifier with home premises, ensuring it refers to the exterior of the home property. Using 'outside' without 'home' could map to the general outdoors concept, and 'home' alone could include indoors; this phrasing avoids those parents. It does not specify any child locations like patio or driveway. 'Outside area on home premises' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that preserves scope."
721046007,Structure of skin of left upper eyelid (body structure),Skin—left upper eyelid,"This concise, problem-list style entry specifies skin at the left upper eyelid, containing the attributes of tissue (skin), anatomical location (upper eyelid), and laterality (left). It is a Body structure and exactly matches SNOMED CT 721046007. Parent or sibling concepts that either omit laterality, omit the skin tissue, or target a different eyelid segment do not fit the wording. The entry conveys no pathological or procedural information."
405781008,Complex care needs (finding),Patient states they have complex care needs,"This patient-reported entry asserts the same clinical finding—complex care needs—mapping to 'Complex care needs (finding)' (405781008), a Clinical finding. The source (patient statement) does not change the concept or introduce separate attributes. Broader care-need concepts and process-related concepts are less precise given the explicit mention of complexity."
258492001,Gallstone specimen (specimen),Pathology specimen: gallstone,"This entry frames the object as a pathology specimen and identifies its type as a gallstone. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 258492001 is the precise code because the specimen is a gallstone, not a tissue sample and not a disorder finding. Parent concepts such as generic “specimen” or “calculi specimen” lack specificity, and sibling concepts like “biliary duct stone specimen” would misrepresent the anatomical origin. The phrase does not introduce extraneous attributes like size or number; naming the setting (pathology) is context only and does not affect the specimen identity, preserving an unambiguous map to the target concept."
387862005,Paspalum notatum specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Specific IgE directed against Paspalum notatum,"The phrase describes allergen-specific IgE antibodies targeting Paspalum notatum, which corresponds to the substance/analyte concept. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. No result interpretation, quantity, or specimen is mentioned, so it is not a finding, observable, or procedure. More generic parents omit species, while pollen-specified variants add attributes not present. The best match is SNOMED CT 387862005."
1003517007,Freeze dried specimen (specimen),Specimen type recorded as freeze-dried,"This entry records the specimen type/condition as freeze-dried, focusing on the preservation state. Category: Specimen. The most precise match is Freeze dried specimen (specimen) 1003517007. It is more detailed than the parent Specimen and does not suggest siblings (e.g., Formalin-fixed) or children (specific specimen sources). The wording is a paraphrase that retains clinical equivalence without introducing new attributes."
223400004,Saint Barthelemy (geographic location),St Barthélemy,"This is a standard abbreviation with the same French spelling, indicating the same geographic locality. The concept falls under the SNOMED CT category Location. The optimal code is Saint Barthelemy (geographic location), SCTID 223400004, because the entry simply names the place; it does not specify type (e.g., island, territory) or region beyond the location’s name. A broader parent would be less specific, and child/sibling concepts are not referenced. The “St” abbreviation is a clinically safe, semantically equivalent synonym that preserves the intended place."
49646008,Wilson's storm petrel (organism),Wilson’s storm-petrel,"This is a hyphenated form of the same common name, referring to the same organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Hyphenation does not alter meaning; it is a clinically and taxonomically accepted variant for Oceanites oceanicus. It maps exactly to SCTID 49646008 rather than to broader parents like Storm petrel or Bird, and it is not a sibling species. No other attributes are implied, so the species-level code is appropriate."
734943006,Surgical traction tensiometer (physical object),Surgical traction tensiometer documented,"This indicates documentation of the device and explicitly identifies it as a surgical traction tensiometer. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The concept matches 734943006 exactly, differentiating it from broader measuring devices or traction apparatus. The documentation context does not introduce additional attributes; it simply notes the presence of the specified device."
226254006,Saturated fat requirement (observable entity),Nutrition evaluation references saturated fat requirement,"This entry situates the saturated fat requirement within a nutrition evaluation context, but the observable concept remains the requirement for saturated fat. No numerical targets or periods are specified. SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 226254006 fits best. Broader parents (nutritional requirement unspecified) are not specific enough, while siblings (e.g., unsaturated fat requirement, saturated fat intake) do not match the stated requirement concept."
130543004,Vicianin beta-glucosidase (substance),Beta-glucosidase targeting vicianin,"This synonymic phrasing describes the same enzyme substance: a beta-glucosidase whose substrate is vicianin. It does not introduce new attributes beyond the inherent specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Mapping to generic beta-glucosidase would be too broad, and sibling enzymes targeting other substrates would not fit. Thus, 130543004 is the correct code."
12399371000119105,Suspected victim of adult physical abuse (situation),Suspected adult physical abuse affecting victim.,"This formulation expresses that adult physical abuse is suspected and pertains to a victim. Category: Situation. The concept is identical to the target: suspicion, adult, physical abuse, victim status. Parent concepts (non-age-specific suspected abuse) and sibling concepts (other abuse modalities) are excluded. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent without introducing additional attributes."
706364000,Dental/endodontic carrier (physical object),Root canal carrier,"‘Root canal’ is a common synonym for endodontic context, and ‘carrier’ identifies the device designed to carry material within that domain. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of Dental/endodontic carrier (706364000) without implying a particular subtype (e.g., gutta‑percha core) or different instrument class (e.g., spreader, plugger), so it maps most precisely to the given concept rather than a parent or sibling."
223894007,Northumberland (geographic location),Place of birth: Northumberland.,"The entry records Northumberland as a birthplace, but the coded concept remains the geographic location itself. The main concept is Northumberland; 'place of birth' is contextual information. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location/qualifier value). The exact location name supports using 223894007. Parent Geographic location would lose specificity, and no alternative child or sibling location is implied. The phrasing is semantically equivalent to naming the location and does not introduce additional attributes that would alter coding."
1366447007,Momelotinib (substance),Outpatient medication record: momelotinib,"The outpatient record contains momelotinib by name, designating the active ingredient. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the exact concept Momelotinib (substance). Since no product details (brand, strength, form, route) are included, product concepts would be less accurate. No broader pharmacologic class or sibling substances are invoked, confirming the specific substance mapping."
242228005,Fall from aircraft in flight (event),Fall from an aircraft during flight,"The text conveys the event of falling from an aircraft, with 'during flight' clearly indicating the aircraft was airborne. No aircraft subtype, injury, intent, or other attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This maps precisely to 'Fall from aircraft in flight (event)' (SCTID: 242228005). Parent concepts lacking the 'in flight' condition are less specific, and sibling or child concepts involving aircraft types would not match because the type is not specified. 'During flight' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'in flight.'"
725606008,Entire superior trunk of brachial plexus (body structure),Anatomy confirmation: entire superior trunk of the brachial plexus,"This confirms the presence of the entire superior trunk of the brachial plexus, a Body structure. The correct SNOMED CT concept is 725606008. The entry is specific to the superior trunk, not the whole plexus (parent), other trunks (siblings), or subcomponents (children), and it introduces no additional attributes; thus, it remains the most precise match."
442066000,Republic of Palau (geographic location),Facility located in the Republic of Palau,"The wording indicates a facility’s location at the country level, naming the Republic of Palau. The codable concept is the geographic location, which fits the Geographic location (Location) category and corresponds to SCTID 442066000. This does not specify a particular city or district (child) nor a broader region (parent); the sovereign state is the exact match."
263703002,Changed status (qualifier value),Radiology report: status changed,"Although presented in a radiology report context, the entry conveys only the qualifier 'status changed' and does not introduce direction or specific imaging details. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 263703002 fits best, as it denotes a generic change in status. Sibling qualifiers like 'Unchanged' or 'Progressed' would add attributes not present in the wording. It is not a radiologic finding statement per se; it functions as a status qualifier, supporting the chosen code."
465355004,Single-side-support walking frame (physical object),Single-lateral-support walking frame,"The entry specifies a walking frame with support on a single lateral side, which matches the single-side-support device design. The main concept is a Physical object. SNOMED CT 465355004 is the exact match because it encodes single-side support as the defining feature. A generic walking frame (parent) omits this specificity, and devices like bilateral frames or rollators are structurally different, making them inappropriate. The synonym uses 'lateral' to capture the same one-sided support attribute without introducing new details."
708495002,Aureimonas altamirensis (organism),Follow-up note entry: Aureimonas altamirensis,"Even in a follow-up documentation context, the content is solely the organism name “Aureimonas altamirensis,” which matches the SNOMED CT Organism concept 708495002. The entry does not convey clinical attributes such as timing, site, or disease; it is a taxonomic label only. The species-level specificity ensures this is not mapped to parent or sibling taxa."
14222000,Lymantria (organism),Specimen label: Lymantria,"The entry indicates a labeling context, but the labeled organism is Lymantria, which corresponds to the genus-level SNOMED CT Organism concept (14222000). It does not state detection, presence in a clinical sample, species, or life stage. Parent taxa (e.g., Lepidoptera) are less specific, and child species are not named. Thus, the genus concept remains the most precise and correct code."
731943005,Entire skin of lumbar region of abdominal wall (body structure),External skin of lumbar region of the abdominal wall,"The phrase captures the external skin covering the lumbar region of the abdominal wall, which corresponds to the entire skin of that defined region. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. 'External skin' emphasizes the skin surface and is synonymous with the skin envelope, without adding attributes like laterality or depth beyond skin. Parent concepts lack the lumbar regional delineation; siblings for lumbar back skin misidentify the body part. Child concepts introducing sidedness or specific skin layers would be too narrow. SCTID 731943005 aligns exactly with the entry."
771980006,Reanastomosis of common bile duct (procedure),Recreation of common bile duct anastomosis,"‘Recreation’ of an anastomosis denotes forming the anastomosis again, synonymous with reanastomosis, and the structure is explicitly the common bile duct. This is a Procedure and aligns with SNOMED CT 771980006. Broader biliary procedures or initial anastomosis codes are less precise. The entry avoids specifying connection targets, approaches, or causes, keeping it tightly focused."
242083006,Run over by railway vehicle (event),Mechanism of injury: run over by railway vehicle,"This states the injury mechanism as being run over by a railway vehicle, fitting the Event category. The phrase defines the specific mechanism of overrun, mapping precisely to SCTID 242083006. It avoids broader parents like unspecified transport events and excludes sibling mechanisms (e.g., hit by, collision with). The entry does not add intent, timing, severity, or location."
226885005,Raw egg (substance),Non-cooked egg,"“Non-cooked” is a clear paraphrase of “raw,” indicating no heat preparation. It denotes a single substance concept with no extra attributes. SNOMED CT category: Substance. Raw egg (substance) is the precise code; broader or different concepts (e.g., cooked egg, egg white/yolk, egg protein) introduce properties not stated here."
446226005,Diastolic blood pressure on admission (observable entity),Admission diastolic blood pressure,"The entry conveys the diastolic blood pressure specifically in the admission context; 'Admission' is the timing attribute, and 'diastolic blood pressure' is the observed physiologic parameter. Category: Observable entity. It maps exactly to 446226005 because the observable is the diastolic component at the admission time point. A more general parent like 'Diastolic blood pressure' is missing the temporal qualifier. Siblings such as 'Systolic blood pressure on admission' or 'Blood pressure at admission' are not appropriate because they refer to the systolic measure or aggregate BP rather than the diastolic component. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not add attributes."
52631000087109,Citrobacter amalonaticus or Citrobacter farmeri (finding),Patient statement: “They found Citrobacter amalonaticus or farmeri.”,"This patient-reported wording conveys that testing found either Citrobacter amalonaticus or Citrobacter farmeri, with no introduction of site, timing, or disease status. The core concept remains organism detection limited to the two species named. It is a Clinical finding and maps precisely to “Citrobacter amalonaticus or Citrobacter farmeri (finding)”. A parent concept for Citrobacter without species detail is too broad, and selecting a single-species child would be inconsistent. The phrasing is a lay equivalent of detection and does not affect code selection."
278964004,Structure of ventriculoaortic junction (body structure),Anatomy reference: ventriculoaortic junction,"The entry references the ventriculoaortic junction in anatomical terms only. It is a Body structure and the precise concept is Structure of ventriculoaortic junction (278964004). Broader parents (e.g., cardiac structure) do not provide the needed specificity, and siblings like aortic root or sinotubular junction are distinct entities. No extra attributes are included."
223519006,Central African country (geographic location),Sovereign state in Central Africa,"“Sovereign state” is a synonym for “country,” and locating it in Central Africa defines the geographic scope. The main concept is a geographic location and aligns with SCTID 223519006. The entry does not name any specific country (avoiding child concepts) and is more precise than general parents such as “Sovereign state” or “African sovereign state.” It does not point to other African subregions, so the chosen code is the best fit."
415971005,Trichoderma harzianum (organism),Reference organism name: Trichoderma harzianum,"Stating a reference organism name at the species level identifies Trichoderma harzianum only, with no clinical, specimen, or strain details. The best code is the Organism concept SCTID 415971005. Parent concepts like Trichoderma genus or Fungi would be overly broad, and no attributes indicate a child concept or any finding/disorder relationship."
1365709005,History of victim of physical abuse (situation),Prior physical abuse of patient (history),"This entry explicitly frames the patient’s prior experience of physical abuse as a historical item, aligning with the Situation concept 'History of victim of physical abuse' (SCTID 1365709005). The wording maintains specificity to physical abuse and to victim status. It would be less appropriate to use a broader 'History of abuse' or a current 'Victim of physical abuse' finding, so the chosen concept is the most accurate."
94721000119105,Family history of craniosynostosis (situation),Family history includes craniosynostosis,"This entry states that craniosynostosis is included in the patient’s family history. The main concept is a family-history situation for craniosynostosis without extra detail. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 94721000119105 is the precise match. Parent concepts like “Family history of disease” are too general, and sibling concepts (e.g., family history of craniofacial anomaly) are less specific. The phrase “includes” is a synonym indicating presence in the family history list and does not introduce new attributes."
440129000,Product manufactured as gastroenteral dose form (product),Pharmaceutical product—gastroenteral dose form,"The entry identifies a pharmaceutical product and designates the gastroenteral dose-form grouping. SNOMED CT category: Product. It fits the concept of a product manufactured as a gastroenteral dose form, without adding specifics that would point to a child (e.g., oral tablet) and without drifting to siblings like rectal or oromucosal. It is more specific than a parent concept that does not specify the gastroenteral category."
370083006,Structure of left lateral portion of upper third of esophagus (body structure),Left lateral area of upper third esophagus,"The entry denotes the left lateral area of the upper third of the esophagus; “area” is a common synonym of “portion” for anatomic site labeling. Attributes present are left laterality, lateral orientation, and upper-third segment. This is a Body structure and matches SCTID 370083006. Using a parent like “upper third of esophagus” would drop the lateral attribute, and siblings would change the orientation. No additional substructures (mucosa, wall, lumen) are identified, avoiding child-level specificity."
313737007,Plasma lysine measurement (procedure),I had a plasma lysine test,"A patient-reported statement indicating a test that measures lysine in plasma still represents the same laboratory Procedure. It maps precisely to 'Plasma lysine measurement (procedure)' (313737007) because it specifies the analyte and specimen. It is not an unspecified lysine test or an amino acid panel, and the wording does not add method or result attributes; 'test' is a common synonym for measurement."
702911006,Podiatry clinic (environment),Imaging study location: podiatry clinic,"The phrase situates an imaging study within a podiatry clinic, but the codable idea is the environment itself. In SNOMED CT, this is an Environment or geographical location, best matched by Podiatry clinic (environment) [702911006]. A parent clinic concept would be too general, and no sibling specialty clinic is indicated. The entry refrains from extra attributes like time or severity, preserving the environmental specificity."
251353001,Minimal phototest dose (observable entity),Patient states: they measured my minimal phototest dose,"This patient-reported phrasing still refers to the same underlying observable—the minimal dose determined during a phototest—without providing a numeric value or specifying a response. It aligns with SNOMED CT 251353001 (observable entity). Mentioning that it was measured does not introduce attributes like endpoint or light type, so siblings such as minimal erythema dose are not appropriate. Parents lacking the minimal qualifier are less precise than this concept."
368200004,Entire superior lateral brachial cutaneous nerve (body structure),Entire superior lateral brachial cutaneous nerve anatomy,"The entry references the anatomical structure, explicitly indicating the entire superior lateral brachial cutaneous nerve. The concept category is Body structure, and the wording avoids adding attributes beyond completeness. SCTID 368200004 is the correct code for the whole nerve; parent concepts that do not specify “entire” or sibling nerves (inferior lateral, medial) would misrepresent the structure. The added word “anatomy” is contextual and does not change the codable concept."
18160006,Excision of lesion of thoracic artery (procedure),Discharge procedure: excision of lesion of thoracic artery,"A discharge summary documenting the procedure as excision of a lesion of the thoracic artery preserves the action and site fidelity. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps exactly to SCTID 18160006, which models excision of a lesion from an artery in the thorax. The entry does not introduce approach, named vessels, or lesion types (e.g., plaque), which would steer toward children or siblings such as endarterectomy. Broader parent procedures that do not specify the thoracic site would be less exact."
150971000119104,"Measles, mumps and rubella vaccination given (situation)",MMR immunization has been given,"This narrative form asserts that the MMR immunization has been given, which is the precise situational context required. The main concept is the MMR vaccination given, categorized as Situation with explicit context. It maps specifically to “Measles, mumps and rubella vaccination given (situation)” because it confirms administration occurred without adding attributes like dose, date, route, or setting. A parent concept like general immunization given would be too broad, and a procedural sibling would reflect the act of administering rather than the documented status of having been given."
269778000,Fire in open area (event),Fire in outdoor setting,"The phrase specifies that the fire occurred outdoors, which is equivalent to in an open area. This is an Event and maps directly to Fire in open area (269778000). It excludes indoor or enclosed environments and avoids subtypes like wildfire or campfire, which could be different children or siblings. No additional attributes such as cause, extent, or temporal details are present, ensuring the most precise match to the target concept."
968287261000119105,History of ductal carcinoma in situ of bilateral breasts (situation),History noted: bilateral ductal carcinoma in situ of the breasts.,"The entry states “History noted,” giving a past context, and specifies “bilateral ductal carcinoma in situ of the breasts,” which is DCIS affecting both breasts. The main concept is historical bilateral DCIS. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It aligns with the history of bilateral DCIS situation; a parent without laterality or a unilateral sibling would be less precise, and a disorder code for DCIS is inappropriate because the disease is not current."
57452002,Homocitrate synthase (substance),Homocitrate synthase enzyme substance,"The phrase reinforces that homocitrate synthase is an enzyme and a substance, which is consistent with SNOMED modeling. The category is Substance. The correct code is 57452002 Homocitrate synthase (substance) since no extra attributes (testing, deficiency, gene, amount, or role) are introduced. Parent classes (Enzyme) are broader, and sibling/child concepts (e.g., homocitrate synthase activity or subunits) would be inaccurate for this simple substance designation."
768453004,Product containing calcium radioisotope (product),Calcium radionuclide-containing product,"The wording uses ‘radionuclide’ as a clinically equivalent synonym for ‘radioisotope,’ and identifies the item as a product. SNOMED CT category: Product. No additional attributes (dose, route, purpose) are introduced. This maps exactly to a product that contains a calcium radionuclide; parents like “Product containing radionuclide” are too general, while children specifying exact isotopes or dosage forms would be too specific. Therefore, SCTID 768453004 is the most accurate code."
26645004,Homocystine (substance),Substance name: homocystine,"This entry specifies the substance name homocystine without any clinical or procedural attributes, clearly pointing to a single chemical entity. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Substance category, with the exact concept Homocystine (26645004). Choosing a parent such as 'chemical entity' would be less specific, while siblings like homocysteine denote distinct compounds. The phrase 'Substance name' is a neutral label that preserves the same code."
411934001,Ulmus americana specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Ulmus americana diagnostic allergen testing extract,"This describes an extract used in allergen testing from Ulmus americana, which corresponds to a specific diagnostic allergen extract product. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (Product). The expanded wording is a stylistic variation that remains clinically equivalent and does not introduce route or concentration. Broader parent products miss the species and specificity, while therapeutic extracts or different species would not match the diagnostic intent and named species."
84944006,Indian white-eye (organism),Avian species—Indian white-eye,"This statement specifies the avian species Indian white-eye, directly matching SNOMED CT SCTID 84944006 in the Organism hierarchy. 'Avian species' is general taxonomy context and does not change the organism identity or add clinical attributes. It is more specific than parent categories such as Aves and excludes sibling Zosterops species. No subspecies detail is present, so the species-level concept is correct."
702096000,Nitrous oxide cartridge (physical object),Nitrous oxide cartridge identified on scene,"The entry names a nitrous oxide cartridge and provides a context that it was identified, without changing the underlying object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The scene context is irrelevant to code selection; the key is the cartridge form, distinguishing it from cylinders, canisters, or substance-only concepts. SCTID 702096000 is the precise match."
242447005,Accident caused by jumping from burning public building (event),EMS narrative: accidental jump from burning public building,"An EMS context note still conveys the same event: an accidental jump from a burning public building. SNOMED CT category is Event. This aligns with 242447005 as it contains the specific external cause—jumping—from a specific scenario—burning public building—under the accidental classification. It does not shift to a more general accident event or to a different mechanism like falling, nor to a different building type. No additional attributes are introduced."
467352002,Contraceptive sponge (physical object),Contraceptive vaginal sponge,"This label specifies the sponge used for contraception and clarifies the typical site of application (vaginal), which is intrinsic to the device’s intended use. The concept remains a Physical object, and SCTID 467352002 (Contraceptive sponge) is the most specific fit. Using a broader 'Contraceptive device' code would be less precise, and selecting siblings like 'vaginal diaphragm' or 'cervical cap' would be incorrect. The mention of 'vaginal' reflects the definitional context of this object and does not introduce extraneous attributes such as usage state, timing, or adverse events; therefore, it does not change the code."
217940004,Accident caused by hay mower (event),Cause of accident recorded as hay mower,"Main concept: accident whose recorded cause is a hay mower; documentation phrasing does not add clinical attributes beyond causation. SNOMED CT category: Event. This specifically aligns with SCTID 217940004. Parent categories like machinery-related accidents are not specific enough, and siblings naming other machines are incorrect. No added attributes (severity, timing, injury site) appear in the entry."
282132009,International System of Units-derived unit of linear velocity (qualifier value),Preferred units: SI-derived linear velocity,Declaring preferred units as SI-derived linear velocity identifies the unit classification at the level of an SI-derived unit for linear velocity. It avoids naming any specific unit (child concepts) and excludes broader or different unit types (parent or sibling concepts). This fits the Qualifier value SCTID 282132009.
225969008,Liaising with relative regarding patient clothing (procedure),Case note: discussed patient clothing with a family member.,"This entry records a discussion with a family member (relative) concerning patient clothing. It is a Procedure. SCTID 225969008 fits exactly, capturing liaison with a relative on the topic of clothing. Broader liaison-with-relative parents would be less precise, and different-topic siblings (e.g., property in general) would not fit. “Discussed” is a synonym for liaising, not changing the concept or introducing additional attributes."
118385009,"Short arm splint, device (physical object)",Supplies listing: short arm splint,"The entry references a supply listing and identifies the object as a short arm splint, with no mention of application, location, or material. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This maps to 118385009 Short arm splint, device. Using a general parent like “Splint (supply)” would be insufficiently specific, and different splint variants are not indicated. The “supplies listing” context simply states the inventory category and does not alter the device identity or code selection."
441609008,Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (geographic location),Follow-up notes reference Timor-Leste,"Here, Timor-Leste is the referenced geographic location; the follow-up note context does not add attributes to the place itself. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The precise code is Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (geographic location), since the text refers to the country and not a subregion or different geographic entity. Parent or sibling concepts would be less accurate. The phrasing is a contextual paraphrase that retains the same location concept."
702923000,Sports medicine clinic (environment),Follow-up setting: sports medicine clinic,"This phrase indicates the designated setting as a sports medicine clinic, focusing on the environment rather than scheduling or actions. Main concept: care environment/facility. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The best code is Sports medicine clinic (environment) [702923000]; using a generic clinic parent would lose detail, and coding to a referral or service would misrepresent the entry. The context term 'follow-up setting' does not introduce timing attributes about the environment itself."
466661004,Body-insulating pad (physical object),Body-insulating pad applied to patient,"The concept is still a body-insulating pad; ‘applied to patient’ is a usage context but does not modify the object’s identity. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This matches SCTID 466661004 because it clearly designates the insulating pad intended for the patient’s body. Parent concepts (generic pads) are too broad, and siblings (electrode pads, absorbent pads, warming pads) imply different functions. The phrase is a context-rich synonym that keeps the same code without adding attributes like timing, severity, or specific type of insulation."
242528009,Burning caused by nitric acid (event),Diagnosis: burn from nitric acid,"This diagnostic line indicates a burn and specifies nitric acid as the cause, without additional attributes such as site or severity. The main concept is a burn event due to nitric acid, which aligns precisely with the SNOMED CT Event 'Burning caused by nitric acid (event)'. Parent concepts that lack agent detail are under-specified, and child concepts with site or degree information are beyond the scope of the statement. The synonymic structure maintains equivalence."
228968004,large pots/day (qualifier value),"Daily quantity unit ""large pots/day""","This entry identifies the daily quantity unit explicitly as “large pots/day,” fitting the Qualifier value category. It matches SCTID 228968004 by retaining the size descriptor and the time denominator. Parent concepts like generic ‘daily units’ or ‘pots per day’ lack the ‘large’ attribute, and siblings alter container or size semantics. The entry provides no numeric quantity or subject of measurement, avoiding drift into observables or findings and staying firmly as the qualifier value."
75859002,"Intraluminal gas production, function (observable entity)",Patient-reported topic: intraluminal gas production function,"This entry frames the same functional parameter as the topic of patient discussion while remaining the observable entity—function of intraluminal gas production (SNOMED CT 75859002). It does not assert a symptom value (e.g., excessive gas) and thus does not map to flatulence or distension. Parent observables are too general, and findings like presence of gas are conceptually different from the functional parameter. The wording is a neutral, clinically equivalent paraphrase."
704720007,Dermatoscopy system (physical object),Dermatoscopy system ordered,"This expresses an order for a dermatoscopy system, clearly a physical object being procured. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The ordering context does not introduce clinical attributes or subtype features. It does not represent a procedural act, so SCTID 704720007 is the correct code over any parent (generic device) or child (specific dermatoscope variant) concepts."
719851003,Wound therapy ultrasound system handpiece tip (physical object),Tip component of wound therapy ultrasound handpiece,"This entry states the tip component belonging to a wound therapy ultrasound handpiece, identifying a Physical object device part. The term “component” reinforces that it is a part, not the entire handpiece or system. The wound therapy ultrasound context prevents mapping to diagnostic ultrasound equipment. No additional attributes like size or reusability are given, so child specializations are avoided. Generic parent classes such as “device tip” would be less specific. Therefore, the concept for wound therapy ultrasound system handpiece tip is the most accurate SNOMED CT match."
67440007,Product containing alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist (product),Alpha adrenergic antagonist medication product,"This entry describes a medication product whose class is alpha adrenergic antagonism, equivalent to a product containing an alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 67440007 is appropriate because the text is generic to the class and avoids specifying active ingredients, routes, doses, or selectivity subtypes. A broader parent (general adrenergic antagonists) would be imprecise, while child or sibling concepts (alpha-1 selective products or named drugs) would overspecify. The terminology used is a synonymous paraphrase of the preferred term without added attributes."
23491000175106,Hepatic function panel declined (situation),Hepatic function panel not obtained—patient declined,"This notes that the hepatic function panel was not obtained due to patient declination, which is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 23491000175106 is the precise code as it names the exact panel and refusal context. It does not shift to a broader “test not done” concept or to child instances of single enzyme tests. No additional attributes are introduced."
217992008,Accident caused by power transmission machinery (event),Accident due to power transmission machinery,"The concept is an accident with the cause stated as power transmission machinery; no modifiers for severity, location, or resulting injuries are present. This fits the Event category in SNOMED CT. The phrase aligns precisely with SCTID 217992008, as 'due to' is a standard synonym for 'caused by' in clinical documentation and does not alter the causal relationship. A broader parent (accident due to machinery) would lose the specificity of power transmission machinery, and any child specifying belts, chains, or gears is not stated. Therefore, this wording maps uniquely to the given concept."
280155002,Entire subaortic portion of interventricular septum (body structure),MRI region of interest: entire subaortic segment of IV septum,"This identifies the entire subaortic segment of the IV septum as the MRI ROI, with no additional attributes beyond anatomy. Category: Body structure. “Segment” is equivalent to “portion” here, and the explicit “entire” modifier makes it match SCTID 280155002. Broader parents or other septal regions would be less appropriate, and a non-entire subaortic reference would be less precise than the complete segment specified."
215612006,"Submersion or drowning due to being washed overboard, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)",Report: injured as an occupant when washed overboard from a small unpowered boat and submerged.,"This report indicates the injured status of a small unpowered boat occupant, the mechanism (washed overboard), and the outcome (submersion), which together match the SNOMED CT Event SCTID 215612006. 'Submerged' is a clinically equivalent expression of submersion/drowning. The entry avoids specifying alternatives that would suggest sibling concepts (fall, jump, capsize) or other vessel types, ensuring a precise mapping."
225731008,Chapel (environment),Proceed to chapel,"This instruction names the chapel as the intended destination, focusing on the environment. It is categorized as an Environment or geographical location concept. SCTID 225731008 is appropriate because it targets the specific place, not a broader or alternative venue like 'Sanctuary' or 'Prayer room.' The directive form does not change the environment being coded."
709189001,Revision of internal fixation of talus bone (procedure),Scheduling: revise internal fixation of talus,"A scheduling entry that requests revision of internal fixation of the talus directly references the procedure. Concepts include revision, internal fixation, and talus, making it a Procedure. It precisely matches 709189001. Parent concepts are broader; siblings such as removal or new fixation are not requested. The imperative phrasing 'revise' is equivalent to 'revision' and does not add attributes."
309168004,Upper respiratory tissue specimen (specimen),"Gross: upper respiratory tissue, specimen only","This pathology gross description identifies the specimen as tissue from the upper respiratory tract, and 'specimen only' indicates no additional components. It captures material (tissue) and region (upper respiratory) with no added site or method attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is best represented by Upper respiratory tissue specimen (SCTID 309168004) within the Specimen hierarchy. A parent like Tissue specimen is too general, and a child specifying a particular subsite (e.g., laryngeal tissue) would be overspecified. Sibling non-tissue specimens (swab, secretion) are excluded."
272859006,SI2 (body structure),Site: SI2,"The phrase identifies the site as SI2, directly mapping to SI2 (body structure), SCTID 272859006. The concept is a specific anatomical location, with SNOMED category Body structure. The simple term “Site” is a safe synonymous descriptor for a body structure. Any parent concept would be less specific, and child or sibling codes for other sites would not match SI2. No added clinical attributes are present."
697591010000104,Immunoglobulin E antibody to Neocosmospora solani (substance),Neocosmospora solani-specific IgE,"The phrase names an immunoglobulin E antibody directed specifically against Neocosmospora solani, with no mention of concentration, specimen, or test outcome. The main medical concept is the antibody substance itself, defined by isotype (IgE) and target (Neocosmospora solani). SNOMED CT category: Substance. This precisely matches SCTID 697591010000104, which represents the IgE antibody to this organism. Broader parent concepts like 'IgE antibody to organism' are too generic, and siblings such as 'IgG to Neocosmospora solani' or 'IgE to other species' would mis-specify isotype or target. The term 'specific' is a standard synonym indicating antigen specificity and does not introduce new attributes."
242482006,Accident caused directly by barbecue (event),"BBQ-caused accident, direct","This concise entry indicates an accident and specifies that it was directly caused by a BBQ (barbecue). It fits the Event category and is best coded to SCTID 242482006. 'BBQ' is a standard synonym for 'barbecue' and does not introduce new attributes. Parent concepts for unspecified accidents or cooking equipment would be too broad, and siblings suggesting indirect causation or alternative mechanisms are inappropriate given the explicit 'direct' qualifier."
298289005,Muscle tender point (finding),Pain elicited at a focal muscle point on palpation,"This describes pain elicited by palpation at a focal point within muscle, which clinically corresponds to a tender point. The concept is a Clinical finding and is best coded as SNOMED CT 298289005 'Muscle tender point (finding)'. The phrasing avoids diffuse tenderness and specifies focality and muscle tissue. It distinguishes from trigger points (which typically cause referred pain) and is more specific than a generic tender point."
773971003,Structure of right piriformis muscle (body structure),Chart label: right piriformis muscle,"The entry refers to the right piriformis muscle as a chart label, which still denotes the anatomical structure with clear laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Anatomical or body structure, and the best match is “Structure of right piriformis muscle” (773971003). Parent structures without laterality are overly broad, and sibling structures for different sides would be wrong. The labeling context does not introduce additional clinical or functional attributes, preserving exact mapping to the anatomical concept."
464803002,Pacemaker battery charger (physical object),"Pacemaker battery charger, catalog entry","This is a catalog listing label for the same physical object: a charger for a pacemaker battery. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 464803002 is the correct code because it refers to the specific charger type; the term “catalog entry” provides context but does not shift coding away from the object itself. More general charger concepts or unrelated device codes (e.g., pacemaker) would be less precise. No additional clinical or technical attributes are introduced."
1187207000,Christmas Island (geographic location),External Territory of Christmas Island,"This wording reflects the official status of Christmas Island as an Australian external territory, still pointing to the single geographic place. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The precise code is 1187207000. Parents like 'Geographic location' or 'Territory' are nonspecific; siblings such as 'Cocos (Keeling) Islands' would be incorrect because the named place is Christmas Island. The descriptor 'External Territory' is part of the formal name and does not introduce new clinical attributes."
411540002,Microorganism specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),"Diagnostic allergen preparation, microorganism specific","This entry refers to a diagnostic allergen preparation (i.e., extract) that is specific to microorganisms. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It fits SCTID 411540002 by embedding the three key elements: allergen extract product, diagnostic use, and microorganism specificity. A parent diagnostic allergen extract without source detail is too general, and naming a particular organism would push to a child concept. Sibling concepts for plant or animal sources would be incorrect. “Preparation” is a standard synonym for extract in product descriptions."
55980008,"Firecracker, device (physical object)",Firecracker observed in backpack.,"The observed item is explicitly a firecracker, matching SNOMED CT 55980008 (Physical object → Device). The location 'in backpack' is contextual and does not alter the object classification. Broader explosive devices or other firework types are not indicated, making the firecracker code the most appropriate."
407316005,Product containing phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (product),Chart note: active medication is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor product,"This statement identifies the active medication on the chart as a product in the PDE5 inhibitor class, without naming the specific ingredient or form. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. SCTID 407316005 is the best match because it denotes a product containing a PDE5 inhibitor. Parent substance concepts lack the 'medication product' aspect, whereas child concepts like 'Product containing sildenafil' would be too specific given the generic phrasing. No dose, route, or brand is implied."
119355008,Polymorphonuclear neutrophil specimen (specimen),Specimen identified as neutrophil (PMN),"This indicates the specimen has been identified as PMN/neutrophil, aligning with a polymorphonuclear neutrophil specimen. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 119355008 is the precise code since PMN equates to neutrophil with a polymorphic nucleus. Parent concepts would be too general, while child concepts like band neutrophil specimens add specificity not present. The synonym usage is clinically standard and equivalent."
371934000,Normality undetermined (qualifier value),Normality cannot be determined,"This statement conveys that a determination of normality is not possible, which is equivalent to normality being undetermined, and does not introduce any other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. Normality undetermined (371934000) is the most precise code because it captures the inability to classify an observation as normal or abnormal. Siblings like 'Normal' or 'Abnormal' are excluded by the phrasing; 'Unknown' or 'Not assessed' differ in meaning because here an assessment outcome is specifically undetermined."
279731002,Structure of vestibular crest (body structure),Vestibular crest,"The entry explicitly names the anatomical structure 'vestibular crest,' which is the ridge within the vestibule of the inner ear. This is a body structure concept, so the SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The most precise match is SNOMED CT 279731002 Structure of vestibular crest (body structure), as it directly corresponds to the named anatomy without adding attributes. Broader parent concepts like Structure of vestibule of inner ear or Structure of bony labyrinth would be less specific. Sibling structures such as crista ampullaris or vestibular fold are different anatomical features and do not match the wording. The entry contains no qualifiers (e.g., laterality, normality, pathology), preserving exact mapping to the body structure concept."
468267003,Evoked-potential graphic recording system (physical object),Evoked-potential recording hardware (graphic),"Referring to the system as “recording hardware” emphasizes the physical device used to graphically record evoked potentials, which aligns with the concept. The main concept is a hardware device for EP graphic recording. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). It matches SCTID 468267003 because it identifies the EP recording system and not the procedure or other equipment (like stimulators). Parent device categories would be too broad; sibling devices focused on other neurophysiological signals are not appropriate. The synonym remains equivalent and does not introduce new attributes."
224815004,Industrial environment (environment),Exam performed in an industrial environment,"This entry documents the environmental context for an exam as industrial; no additional attributes beyond the environment type are present. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The industrial environment concept corresponds to SCTID 224815004. Using a parent Environment would lose specificity, and no alternative environment type is implied."
399514000,"Distance of anterior margin of tumor base from limbus of cornea at cut edge, after sectioning (observable entity)",Anterior base margin to limbus distance at cut edge (after specimen sectioning),"This entry denotes the observable distance from the corneal limbus to the anterior margin of the tumor base at the cut edge following specimen sectioning. It is an Observable entity and does not provide numerical results or additional attributes. SCTID 399514000 matches exactly because it includes anterior margin, tumor base, limbus, and the after-sectioning cut edge context. Parent or sibling concepts would compromise specificity by changing margin focus or timing. The synonym 'anterior base margin' is equivalent to 'anterior margin of tumor base,' preserving code selection."
699169000,Open reduction of fracture of calcaneus without internal fixation (procedure),Follow-up note: status post open reduction of calcaneus fracture without internal fixation,"This follow-up documentation references a completed procedure—open reduction at the calcaneus—with explicit note that internal fixation was not used. The referent concept is the Procedure itself, making SCTID 699169000 the correct mapping. Selecting a ‘history of’ situation concept would change the semantic category, whereas the entry is best captured by the procedure performed. ORIF or closed reduction siblings are excluded by the wording, and no added attributes are present."
702878005,Land ambulance (environment),Ambulance (road) setting,"The main idea is the setting being an ambulance operating on roads, i.e., a land ambulance. This falls under the Environment category. It fits 702878005 precisely because it specifies the land modality; it does not align with broader ambulance environments or air/water ambulance siblings. The synonym “road” is semantically equivalent and does not introduce any new attributes."
737285005,Joint implant in situ (finding),Joint arthroplasty prosthesis present,"This denotes that a prosthesis placed during joint arthroplasty is present, without naming the joint or providing any status beyond presence. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. The most precise match is 737285005 because it is specifically a finding of a joint implant being in place. General parents lack joint specificity, and joint-specific children are overly detailed for the text. “Arthroplasty prosthesis” is a clinically equivalent way to indicate a joint implant in situ."
213986003,Injured by object set in motion by train (event),Hit by object dislodged by train,"The phrasing identifies an injury mechanism where an object was dislodged by a train and struck the person. That is exactly the Event 'Injured by object set in motion by train' (SCTID 213986003). 'Dislodged' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of set-in-motion. It excludes direct train impact, distinguishing this from sibling concepts such as 'struck by train', and is more specific than parent categories like 'railway accident'."
715105007,Does not transfer from chair to toilet (finding),"Patient statement: ""I do not transfer from my chair to the toilet.""","A patient-reported statement identifying non-performance of chair-to-toilet transfer is a Clinical finding. This corresponds directly to SCTID 715105007 because it specifies the exact transfer and that it is not done, without adding attributes like inability, assistance, or safety. Broader parent findings or sibling concepts with different transfer endpoints or added qualifiers would be less appropriate."
702932003,Oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic (environment),Site of service: oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic,"The entry specifies the site of service as the clinic for oral and maxillofacial surgery, which is an environment/location concept. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is 'Oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic (environment)' SCTID 702932003. Sibling concepts like generic surgical clinics or dental clinics are less precise. The phrase does not introduce procedures or encounter types, keeping the focus on setting."
259650005,Carbohydrate antigen M29 (substance),"Antigen M29, carbohydrate","This paraphrase identifies the antigen by number (M29) and clarifies its carbohydrate nature, pointing directly to the substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 259650005 is the exact match; broader parents are too general and alternate numbered antigens are siblings that do not correspond to 'M29.' The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and avoids adding any clinical findings, severity, timing, or associations, keeping it strictly as the substance."
401119001,Family history of hemochromatosis (situation),Family hx: hemochromatosis,"This entry uses 'hx' as a standard shorthand for history and clearly denotes a family history entry related to hemochromatosis. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. The best code is SCTID 401119001 (Family history of hemochromatosis) because it precisely matches the documented familial condition. Using 'Hemochromatosis (disorder)' would misrepresent a personal diagnosis, and a generic family history code would be too broad. The shorthand does not alter clinical meaning or introduce new attributes."
465535001,"Tongue depressor, examination (physical object)",Tongue depressor—examination device,"The dash-separated format still names the device and its examination purpose. The concept is a Physical object and corresponds to SCTID 465535001. It neither introduces material or single-use specifications nor implies a performed procedure, thus avoiding children or procedural codes. Generic parent devices are less specific, and alternate instruments (siblings) would not match the explicit 'tongue depressor' wording."
309261004,Sigmoid colon brushings specimen (specimen),Specimen received: sigmoid colon brushings,"This receipt confirmation describes a specimen made up of brushings from the sigmoid colon. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It directly corresponds to Sigmoid colon brushings specimen (309261004). The phrase 'specimen received' adds logistical context without altering the identity of the specimen. Using parent concepts would reduce specificity by omitting method or site, and sibling concepts (biopsy, swab) imply different collection methods. The entry is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
26046004,Cardiovascular stress test using bicycle ergometer (procedure),They ran a cardiac stress test while I pedaled the bike,"This patient-context description identifies a cardiac stress test carried out while pedaling a bike, which indicates a bicycle ergometer modality and aligns with SCTID 26046004. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The modality (“pedaled the bike”) establishes equivalence to bicycle ergometer testing, ruling out the generic parent and differentiating from treadmill or pharmacologic siblings. No imaging or monitoring specifics are stated, keeping the mapping at the correct level of specificity."
217464009,Jump from burning hotel (event),Triage note: jump from burning hotel,"In triage context, the core event is unchanged: jump from a hotel that is burning. No injuries, intent, or specific location are stated. SNOMED CT category: Event. The mapping is precisely to 'Jump from burning hotel (event),' not to parent concepts (e.g., 'Jump') or siblings (e.g., 'Fall from hotel')."
224070000,Missouri (geographic location),Administrative area: Missouri,"Describing Missouri as an administrative area still identifies the state-level geographic location without altering the core concept. This maps to Missouri (geographic location), SCTID 224070000, in the Geographic location (Location) hierarchy. It does not add attributes or shift focus to the USA or to cities/counties within Missouri, so parent, child, or sibling concepts would be less appropriate."
69859008,Free-standing rheumatology clinic (environment),Non-hospital rheumatology clinic,"This phrasing specifies the care environment as a rheumatology clinic that is not hospital-based, i.e., free-standing, which corresponds to SCTID 69859008 within the Environment category. “Non-hospital” is a clinically equivalent way to express free-standing status without introducing other attributes. More general parent concepts do not specify the free-standing aspect, and non-specialty siblings fail to indicate rheumatology. Therefore, this wording fits the exact concept without drift to parent or sibling codes."
1186987000,British Indian Ocean Territory (geographic location),British Indian Ocean Terr.,"The entry is a common shortened form of British Indian Ocean Territory, still referring to the exact same geographic entity. It falls under the SNOMED CT category Geographic location. The truncation introduces no new attributes and does not change meaning. Broader parents (e.g., British overseas territories) or narrower children (e.g., Diego Garcia) are not specified, making SCTID 1186987000 the most precise code."
223791007,Cavan (geographic location),Patient-reported place: Cavan,"This indicates that the patient provided the place name “Cavan,” with the codable element being the geographic location itself. The SNOMED CT category is Location. SCTID 223791007 matches the concept of the place name Cavan. Parent concepts are too broad, and specific county or town forms are not implied. The qualifier “patient-reported” is context about the source, not an attribute that changes the location concept."
107251000119108,Genetic counseling for heritable disorder with fetus at risk done (situation),Prenatal visit: genetic counseling for heritable disorder with fetus at risk completed.,"The entry situates the counseling within a prenatal visit and explicitly states completion, alongside the heritable disorder with fetus-at-risk context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It accurately fits the concept because the prenatal setting reinforces the presence of a fetus and the statement confirms the counseling has been done. A parent concept such as generic prenatal genetic counseling would be less specific without the fetus-at-risk for a heritable disorder, and sibling concepts indicating other statuses would be inappropriate. No additional attributes beyond the concept are introduced."
271848000,Suppressed urine secretion (finding),Urine formation suppressed,"The entry indicates that urine formation is suppressed, i.e., decreased renal secretion without added attributes of cause or degree. It fits the Clinical finding 'Suppressed urine secretion' and should be coded to SNOMED CT 271848000. Sibling concepts like oliguria/anuria would over-specify degree, and urinary retention misrepresents the process as a voiding issue. The synonym maintains equivalence with the target concept."
217277003,Accident due to fall from burning house (event),Accident due to fall from a fire-engulfed house,"A 'fire-engulfed house' is semantically equivalent to 'burning house,' and the accident due to fall is explicitly stated. This fits the Event category and corresponds to SCTID 217277003. Alternatives that generalize the location or omit the fire would be less precise. The entry does not introduce severity, timing, or injury details."
364108009,Lymph node observable (observable entity),Lymph node descriptor (observable),"A 'descriptor' in this context refers to an observable descriptor pertaining to lymph nodes, with no attribute specified. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The best mapping is 'Lymph node observable' (364108009). Parent terms are too broad, and children such as 'Morphology of lymph node' or 'Location of lymph node' would add detail the text does not contain. The synonym 'descriptor' is consistent with observables terminology and does not change code selection."
275574006,History of myomectomy (situation),Has had a myomectomy,"The phrasing indicates a completed procedure in the past, specifically myomectomy. This is a Situation with explicit context. History of myomectomy (275574006) is the exact code, being more specific than a generic past surgical history and not implying present performance or postoperative complications, so procedure or sibling concepts do not fit better."
1290563003,"Plain X-ray of forearm, anteroposterior and lateral views (procedure)","Radiographic imaging of forearm: AP and lateral, no contrast","This text specifies radiographic imaging (plain X-ray) of the forearm performed with AP and lateral views, explicitly noting no contrast. The main concept is the imaging procedure; attributes include modality (plain radiography), contrast status (no contrast), site (forearm), and views (AP, lateral). Category: Procedure. SCTID 1290563003 is the most precise match, as it denotes plain forearm X-rays with these projections. Parent concepts without view detail and sibling concepts with different view sets are less appropriate. 'No contrast' reiterates the plain nature without changing the concept."
309180007,Nasopharyngeal biopsy specimen (specimen),Biopsy sample from nasopharynx,"This specifies a biopsy-derived sample (sample/specimen are clinically equivalent in this context) from the nasopharynx and clearly falls under the Specimen hierarchy. It precisely matches Nasopharyngeal biopsy specimen (specimen), SCTID 309180007. A parent concept lacking site detail or a sibling involving a different collection modality (e.g., swab, brushing) would be less appropriate. The synonym 'sample' does not change the specimen nature or the code selection."
414350003,Product containing glutamate receptor antagonist (product),Pharmacologic product classified as a glutamate receptor antagonist,"This entry explicitly conveys a product classification based on pharmacologic role (glutamate receptor antagonist), which is exactly what 414350003 represents. It remains a Pharmaceutical/biologic product and does not add subclass, formulation, or indication attributes. Mapping to a broader parent would drop the role; mapping to a narrower child (e.g., NMDA-specific) would add unstated detail."
433448008,Family history of carotid endarterectomy (situation),Patient indicates family history of carotid endarterectomy,"The patient-reported phrasing confirms that the family history includes carotid endarterectomy, which is a familial occurrence of a specific procedure. This maps to SNOMED CT Situation 'Family history of carotid endarterectomy' (433448008). It avoids details like specific relatives or indications, so no narrower child concept is implied. Procedure, personal history, or disorder codes are inappropriate because it pertains to relatives. Parent concepts are too broad and sibling concepts for other carotid procedures would miscode the exact procedure named."
411932002,Schinus molle specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Schinus molle allergy testing reagent (diagnostic),"The term “allergy testing reagent (diagnostic)” is a clinical synonym for a specific diagnostic allergen extract, and the species is Schinus molle, which exactly maps to SCTID 411932002. Main concept: product used for allergy diagnosis; attributes: species-specific. Category: Product. Parent generic reagent/allergen extract concepts are too broad, and child concepts introducing method or formulation details are not supported by this wording. Siblings for different species are excluded by the Schinus molle qualifier."
427620008,Product containing phosphotransferase inhibitor (product),Phosphotransferase inhibitor-containing pharmaceutical item,"The entry names a pharmaceutical item that contains a phosphotransferase inhibitor, i.e., a medicinal product. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). 'Pharmaceutical item' semantically denotes a product and does not add attributes. The inhibitor class matches SCTID 427620008. Broader or different enzyme inhibitor categories are not appropriate, and specific subclasses like 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor item' would narrow beyond the text."
773714005,Structure of extensor tendon within middle finger of left hand (body structure),Surgical reference: extensor tendon of the left middle finger,"This entry indicates the referenced anatomy in a surgical context: the extensor tendon for the left middle finger, a Body structure. It aligns with SCTID 773714005 by specifying tendon type and location. The context does not imply injury, repair, or subcomponent, so mapping remains at the structure level, not to broader or narrower related concepts."
420921006,Gentiana lutea preparation (product),Yellow gentian (Gentiana lutea) preparation,"This specifies the common name yellow gentian alongside the Latin binomial Gentiana lutea, indicating the same species-based preparation with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). Using the common and scientific names together is an accepted synonym approach and preserves exact species. Parent concepts would be too generic, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., gentian preparations of other species or specific extracts) do not match the wording."
263686003,Bony (qualifier value),Descriptor: bony,"The phrase indicates that 'bony' is being used purely as a descriptor, which is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT, mapping to Bony (qualifier value) [263686003]. It does not introduce a subject (e.g., which structure) or any condition, thereby avoiding misclassification as a finding or body structure. Parent or sibling concepts are less specific because the intended use is a descriptive quality only."
257625003,Hockey field (environment),Image location: hockey field,"In an imaging or photographic report context, the location is documented as a hockey field; the core concept remains the environment. This maps to the Environment category and SCTID 257625003. The 'Image location' prefix is contextual metadata and does not change the location concept or add clinical attributes. It excludes broader sports fields and ice rinks, maintaining precise alignment with Hockey field (environment)."
54052003,"Intestinal bicarbonate-dependent chloride absorption, function (observable entity)",Follow-up topic: intestinal bicarbonate-dependent chloride absorption function,"This entry frames the concept as a follow-up topic but clearly names the physiological function of bicarbonate-dependent chloride absorption in the intestine, with no normal/abnormal status or site subdivision. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 54052003 is the exact match. A broader parent such as intestinal chloride absorption would omit the dependence attribute; siblings (e.g., chloride secretion or sodium transport functions) are different processes. Context (‘follow-up topic’) does not change the underlying codable function."
466237002,Rigid salpingoscope (physical object),Rigid salpingoscope documented,"The phrase indicates that a rigid salpingoscope is recorded in documentation, specifying the device and its rigid construction. It fits the Physical object category and best maps to Rigid salpingoscope, SCTID 466237002. The administrative context does not change the device being referenced. A non-specific salpingoscope or flexible salpingoscope would not match the stated rigidity."
418229004,Log international units per milliliter (qualifier value),Analytical unit: log IU/mL,"The entry describes the analytical unit as 'log international units per milliliter.' This is a unit of measure and thus a Qualifier value. SCTID 418229004 exactly represents this unit. Parent or generic unit codes are overly broad, while sibling units without the logarithmic transform or with different numerators (e.g., copies) are inappropriate. The abbreviated form is a valid synonym and adds no new attributes."
1187357006,Island in region of British Virgin Islands (geographic location),BVI island (geographic location),"This phrasing denotes an island in the British Virgin Islands, explicitly labeled as a geographic location, which matches the concept 'Island in region of British Virgin Islands' (SCTID 1187357006). The category is Geographic location. The use of the acronym 'BVI' is a clinically and geographically equivalent synonym. Parent concepts that are generic islands would be overly broad, and siblings like 'BVI city' or 'BVI coastline' describe different feature types. No added attributes or named island are introduced."
224062005,Kentucky (geographic location),The Commonwealth of Kentucky,"Including ‘The’ before ‘Commonwealth of Kentucky’ is stylistic and does not alter the concept, which remains the geographic location Kentucky within the Location (Geographic location) category. SCTID 224062005 exactly corresponds. Parent or sibling geographic entities would not be as precise, and no clinical or temporal attributes are introduced."
4346009,Genus Eikenella (organism),"Eikenella, genus-level designation","The phrase identifies Eikenella and clarifies that the designation is at the genus level, with no species or clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most precise code is SCTID 4346009 (Genus Eikenella). Mapping to a broader parent would lose specificity, and mapping to species children would add unsupported detail. The synonymic phrasing does not change the taxonomic scope."
272142003,Extensiveness (qualifier value),Extensiveness category,"Category indicates the dimension by which extent is categorized, aligning with Extensiveness as a Qualifier value. The entry does not declare any specific extent state, only the axis itself, pointing to SCTID 272142003. Parent general qualifier classes are too broad, and child values like generalized or limited are too specific; sibling axes (e.g., Chronicity) are not applicable given the wording."
21722004,Human rhinovirus 92 (organism),Human rhinovirus No. 92,"Using 'No. 92' is a stylistic way to denote the numbered human rhinovirus type, which is the organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The numeric designation makes SCTID 21722004 the precise match. It excludes general human rhinovirus and any clinical finding terminology, avoiding mappings to parent, sibling, or detection concepts."
224054002,Maui (geographic location),Event location: Maui,"The entry identifies Maui as the location of an event; the value remains the place name. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (Geographic location). Maui (geographic location) [224054002] is the exact match, as Maui is the geographic location referenced. Choosing a parent region or a subregion would introduce mismatch. No additional clinical attributes beyond the location are included."
392570002,Blood pressure finding (finding),Blood pressure finding recorded in chart,"The content conveys that a clinical finding regarding blood pressure is recorded, without any additional clinical attributes such as value or trend. The correct SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, specifically Blood pressure finding (392570002). This avoids misclassification as a measurement procedure or as the observable entity. It also avoids specificity toward systolic/diastolic or abnormal states, so parent concepts are too general and child/sibling concepts are not warranted."
129410003,Remobilization - action (qualifier value),Action selected: remobilization,"The entry indicates that remobilization was the selected action, aligning with 'Remobilization - action' (qualifier value, 129410003). No anatomical site, timing, or outcome is stated. The wording is distinct from 'Mobilization' and thus should not be mapped to that sibling action. The selection context does not change the underlying action concept."
134699000,Gluten-free and wheat-free pastry mix (product),Catering procurement request: gluten-free and wheat-free pastry mix,"The procurement request names the product clearly as a gluten-free and wheat-free pastry mix, which matches SNOMED CT Product concept 134699000. The procurement context does not alter or add attributes beyond the product identity. Coding to broader mixes or to gluten-free-only/wheat-free-only siblings would not reflect the dual specification. Therefore, the specific product code is the most accurate selection."
66148002,Sabadilla (substance),Ingredient name: Sabadilla,"The entry names Sabadilla as an ingredient, which is a permissible context for the same substance entity. The concept is the Substance Sabadilla, and the correct SNOMED CT code is 66148002. It does not specify a product, dose, route, extract, or clinical reaction, so selecting product or extract concepts would be less accurate than the base substance."
223838007,Isle d'Elba (geographic location),Report header location: Isola d’Elba,"This notes a location field containing 'Isola d’Elba,' which precisely references SNOMED CT 223838007 (geographic location). The phrase does not imply additional attributes; it remains a pure place designation. Using broader parents or alternative islands would be less accurate. The Italian synonym remains clinically equivalent to the preferred English name."
224030007,Baffin island (geographic location),Baffin Island (geographic location),"The parenthetical clarifier explicitly states the category but does not alter the referent, which is the proper name of the island. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Because the entry names Baffin Island itself, SCTID 224030007 is the precise code; broader parents (e.g., 'Island') or other places are not described."
1193515004,Structure of long digital flexor tendon of thumb - Zone II (body structure),"Thumb long flexor tendon (flexor pollicis longus), Zone II","The wording identifies the long flexor tendon of the thumb, clarifies it as flexor pollicis longus, and states Zone II, precisely matching the body structure SCTID 1193515004. The concept is an anatomical structure with zone designation, so Body structure is the correct category. A broader tendon structure without the zone or a different zone sibling would not capture the specified anatomy. 'Thumb long flexor tendon' is a clinically safe synonym when paired with 'flexor pollicis longus,' keeping the code selection unchanged."
67906003,Etiocholanolone (substance),Steroid name: etiocholanolone,"This entry labels the specific steroid by name, etiocholanolone, without introducing measurement, administration, or clinical findings. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance, and the closest match is Etiocholanolone (SCTID 67906003). A parent like Steroid is too general, and other steroid siblings (e.g., androsterone) are not referenced. The phrasing remains a straightforward identification of the chemical, supporting the substance code."
3492002,Galactinol-sucrose galactosyltransferase (substance),Galactinol-sucrose galactosyltransferase [enzyme],"The bracketed label reiterates the type but the entry continues to denote the precise enzyme substance; category: Substance. It maps to SCTID 3492002. Generic parent classes (e.g., Enzyme) are too broad, and sibling galactosyltransferases for other substrate pairs would not match. No additional properties such as origin or measurement are present."
119321005,Milk specimen (specimen),Specimen description: milk,"The description states the specimen is milk, without any origin or processing details. The main concept is a specimen defined by milk as the material. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This is best represented by Milk specimen (119321005). Parent concepts are overly broad, and child/sibling concepts that specify human breast milk or other sources are not supported here."
364640009,Cough impulse of lump (observable entity),Workup documentation: cough impulse of lump,"The entry documents the workup item 'cough impulse of lump,' describing the observable attribute to be assessed in relation to a lump during coughing, without presenting a result. It belongs to the Observable entity category and matches SCTID 364640009. Using a finding code or a hernia-specific observable would add or change meaning beyond the stated attribute."
703067005,Feeding tube procedure using fluoroscopic guidance (procedure),Feeding tube procedure carried out with fluoroscopic guidance,"The entry describes conducting a feeding tube procedure using fluoroscopic imaging for guidance. Main concept: feeding tube procedure; attribute: fluoroscopic guidance. Category: Procedure. This matches SNOMED 703067005 directly. Parent concepts lacking the guidance qualifier are too broad, and child concepts (specific insertion/removal/replacement) are not indicated. The synonym 'carried out with fluoroscopic guidance' is equivalent to 'using fluoroscopic guidance' and does not affect code choice."
788097001,Excessive dose of vaccine administered with undetermined intent (event),Vaccination overdose occurred; unable to determine intent.,"This entry states a vaccination overdose, which is equivalent to an excessive vaccine dose, and that the intent cannot be determined. Category: Event. It matches 788097001 precisely: vaccine administration at excessive dose with undetermined intent. A parent concept without intent would be less exact, while accidental or intentional siblings are ruled out by 'unable to determine intent.' The synonym 'vaccination overdose' does not add attributes and is clinically equivalent to 'excessive dose of vaccine.'"
411941007,Amaranthus retroflexus specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Amaranthus retroflexus allergen extract for skin testing (diagnostic),"This entry states the species and the diagnostic nature of the allergen extract used for skin testing, consistent with the Product concept 411941007. 'For skin testing' reiterates diagnostic use inherent to the concept and does not add unrelated attributes. Parent concepts such as unspecified allergen extracts or Amaranthus genus-level products lack specificity, while sibling concepts like therapeutic immunotherapy extracts or mixtures would not apply. The synonymic phrasing remains clinically equivalent."
411228001,Photoallergen (product),Diagnostic summary: photoallergen,"The diagnostic documentation references a 'photoallergen' without further clinical findings. The SNOMED CT category is Product, mapping to 411228001 Photoallergen (product). No attributes such as exposure, severity, or specific identity are provided, which would otherwise push toward a disorder or specific substance concept. Parent or sibling product categories would be less accurate as the photo-dependent allergen property is named."
117885000,Verotoxin identification (procedure),Verotoxin identification (laboratory procedure),"The phrase denotes a laboratory procedure whose sole focus is identifying verotoxin, with no details on technique or results. Main concept: verotoxin identification; SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 117885000 is the correct, specific code because the procedure is identification of verotoxin. A parent such as laboratory procedure or toxin identification would be too broad, and siblings like detection or assay represent different procedural intents. The parenthetical note ‘laboratory procedure’ provides context but does not add attributes that change coding."
301641001,Difficulty getting on and off furniture (finding),Caregiver reports difficulty getting on and off furniture,"This entry documents a third-party report of a Clinical finding: difficulty getting on and off furniture. The reporting source does not change the underlying concept. It aligns with SCTID 301641001. Parent concepts would not capture the specific activity, and child concepts naming specific furniture (e.g., bed or chair) are not indicated by the general term 'furniture.'"
104464008,"Acid phosphatase measurement, forensic examination (procedure)",Forensic workup: acid phosphatase measurement,"This frames the acid phosphatase measurement as part of a forensic workup, which corresponds to the Procedure of forensic acid phosphatase measurement. The wording does not add specimen, anatomical site, or results. A broader parent (acid phosphatase measurement without forensic context) would be less precise; more specific children involving defined specimen types are not supported by this entry."
472868006,Swab from peritoneal cavity structure (specimen),Peritoneal cavity swab (specimen),"By appending '(specimen)', the entry confirms the object is a specimen and specifies a swab from the peritoneal cavity, aligning exactly with SCTID 472868006. Category: Specimen. It adds no extra attributes. Broader swab concepts without site or different specimen types from the peritoneal cavity are excluded by the combination of both modality and source stated here."
223548000,Lesotho (geographic location),Country of birth — Lesotho,"The entry sets the birthplace country as Lesotho. The coded concept remains the geographic location Lesotho (SCTID 223548000), category Location—Geographic location. The context label does not change the place name or imply a city or region; therefore, more generic or alternative location concepts would be less precise."
702842000,Congenital heart disease clinic (environment),Service location: congenital heart disease clinic,"This designates the location where care is delivered, namely a congenital heart disease clinic, an environmental setting. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps best to SCTID 702842000. Parent concepts like clinic (environment) would be overly general, while siblings like cardiology clinic do not capture congenital specificity. Child concepts with additional qualifiers would go beyond the entry’s scope."
890468006,Inadequate intake of potassium (finding),Food intake does not meet potassium requirements,"The entry indicates that the person's food intake fails to meet potassium requirements, which reflects inadequate intake. It belongs to the Clinical finding category. SCTID 890468006 is appropriate because it specifically denotes inadequate potassium intake. Parent concepts about inadequate nutrient intake are too broad, and siblings like lab abnormalities or diet restrictions represent different issues. The phrasing is a direct synonym of inadequate intake and does not introduce causation, severity, or timing."
37137006,Human rhinovirus 43 (organism),Organism: Human rhinovirus 43,"This is a catalog-style designation specifying the organism as Human rhinovirus 43. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It precisely fits SCTID 37137006, distinguishing it from the parent Human rhinovirus and from other sibling serotypes. The phrasing does not introduce clinical findings, test results, or causal roles."
247386004,Obturator neuralgia (finding),Neuralgia of the obturator nerve,"This paraphrase explicitly states neuralgia affecting the obturator nerve with no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It is a clinically equivalent expression of Obturator neuralgia (finding) SCTID 247386004. Broader neuralgia would be insufficiently specific, and related concepts like obturator nerve disorder or injury would add a pathologic state beyond a neuralgic pain finding."
141000119100,Daytime somnolence (finding),Patient reports feeling sleepy during the day.,"The statement indicates the clinical finding of somnolence limited to daytime, using ‘sleepy’ as a synonym for somnolence. No severity, duration, or cause is specified. This is a Clinical finding. It most precisely matches Daytime somnolence (finding) rather than generic Somnolence (lacks time-of-day) and avoids excessive/severity concepts such as Excessive daytime sleepiness or disorder-level terms."
216416008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, shop, commercial (environment)",Summary: accident/poisoning place—shop/commercial,"The summary documents the accident/poisoning place as shop/commercial, exactly matching SNOMED CT 216416008. The main concept is the environmental place-of-occurrence, with no added details about mechanism or severity. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This selection is more precise than unspecified place and avoids child/sibling concepts by not naming specific store types or other settings. Using the preferred term ensures accurate code assignment."
472881004,Swab from pharynx (specimen),Swab specimen from pharynx,"This phrase directly names a swab specimen with the collection site specified as the pharynx. The concepts stated are specimen (swab) and source (pharynx), fitting the Specimen category. SNOMED CT 472881004 Swab from pharynx (specimen) exactly corresponds to this wording. More general parents like swab specimen without a site are less specific, and siblings or children referring to particular subregions (e.g., nasopharynx, oropharynx) would be inappropriate because no subsite is indicated."
309079007,Lymph node biopsy specimen (specimen),Prior specimen on file: lymph node biopsy,"A follow-up/history note that indicates the type of prior specimen as a lymph node biopsy. The concept is a Specimen and fits SNOMED 309079007 precisely. It avoids technique-specific details or regional qualifiers; broader parent codes would lose specificity, and child/sibling codes would over-specify method or site variant."
33351000087104,Urine specimen from ureterostomy (specimen),Ureterostomy urine specimen,"This entry conveys a urine specimen with the source being a ureterostomy. The main concept is a specimen entity. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps precisely to SCTID 33351000087104 because the wording ties urine to the ureterostomy origin. Using the more generic parent 'Urine specimen' would lose the source detail, and alternatives like 'Urostomy urine specimen' could broaden beyond ureterostomy, making them less specific and thus not as accurate. No additional attributes are implied."
223853004,French Guiana (geographic location),Place name: French Guiana,"The concept expressed is the place name 'French Guiana,' with no qualifiers about subareas or administrative status. SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The most precise match is French Guiana (geographic location) SCTID 223853004. Parent concepts (e.g., continental regions) and child concepts (e.g., Cayenne) are not indicated. 'Place name' is a neutral context that keeps the entry codable to the location."
216335007,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, sand pit (environment)",Poisoning occurred in a sand pit,"The statement identifies the environmental location where a poisoning took place: a sand pit. It does not introduce mechanism details, severity, timing, or other attributes beyond the place-of-occurrence. The SNOMED category is Environment or geographical location. The most precise code is SNOMED CT 216335007, which captures a sand pit specifically as the place of occurrence for accident or poisoning events. Mapping to a general place-of-occurrence parent would lose specificity, and sibling concepts like sandbox, playground, or beach would misrepresent the setting. The phrase uses the allowed context (poisoning) from the FSN and remains equivalent to the target concept."
160709000,Ground floor flat (environment),Ground-level apartment,"This entry expresses an apartment situated at ground level, which is equivalent to 'Ground floor flat (environment)'. The category is Environment or geographical location. Using 'apartment' instead of 'flat' is a regional synonym and does not change the environmental concept. A parent concept like 'Apartment (environment)' would be too general, and children or siblings indicating other floors would not match the text. The specificity of ground level makes SCTID 160709000 the best fit."
215903006,"Aircraft crash while taking off, occupant of unpowered aircraft, except parachutist, injured (event)",Injured onboard individual in unpowered aircraft takeoff crash (not a parachutist),"The text describes an onboard individual (occupant) injured in an unpowered aircraft crash during takeoff, explicitly excluding parachutist status. Main concepts: takeoff crash, unpowered aircraft, occupant, injury, exclusion of parachutists. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 215903006 is precise for this wording. Parent concepts like generic aircraft crash or takeoff crash without unpowered/occupant details are less specific, and siblings involving powered aircraft or parachutists do not match. “Onboard individual” is a valid paraphrase for occupant, and “not a parachutist” retains the concept’s exclusion."
38962007,"Skin pigmentation, function (observable entity)",Report field: skin pigmentation function,"As a report field label, this entry points to the same observable entity—skin pigmentation function—used within a diagnostic or clinical report. No outcome or interpretation is present. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity and the precise code is SCTID 38962007. It avoids neighboring concepts like appearance findings or pigment disorders and does not imply a measurement procedure. The contextual label does not change the underlying coded concept."
467220004,Bone hook (physical object),Bone hook on sterile field,"The statement notes the presence of the bone hook on the sterile field, identifying the device. Category: Physical object. The most appropriate SNOMED code is 467220004 because the object is the bone hook itself. The context of location does not alter the instrument’s identity or imply a variant, so parent or sibling concepts are less accurate. No device attributes beyond identity are introduced."
275144009,Has infirm partner (situation),Family/relationship: infirm partner.,"The documentation section indicates the patient’s partner is infirm, focusing on the relationship. It is a Situation concept within SNOMED CT. Has infirm partner (275144009) is the most specific match because it captures partner plus infirmity without implying spouse or other relatives. Alternatives with broader or narrower relationships would misrepresent the entry."
223790008,Carlow (geographic location),Carlow locality,"The term indicates Carlow as a locality, i.e., a geographic place. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). It corresponds to 223790008 |Carlow (geographic location)|. It avoids specifying administrative type (county/town), so using more specific child/sibling concepts would not be justified. 'Locality' is a generic place descriptor and does not add attributes beyond location."
702868007,Immunology clinic (environment),Immunology clinic place,"The wording identifies the place as the immunology clinic, expressing only the environment of care. It does not introduce procedures or conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. 'Place' is a generic location descriptor that remains semantically equivalent to the clinic setting. A broader parent such as generic clinic place would lack the immunology specificity; siblings like rheumatology clinic are not indicated. SCTID 702868007 matches precisely."
213953002,Run over by rolling stock - railway employee (event),Railway staff member run over by rolling stock,"Main concept: being run over by rolling stock with the victim identified as a railway staff member, which is synonymous with railway employee. Attributes: mechanism and role. SNOMED CT category: Event. 'Staff member' in the railway context is clinically equivalent to 'employee' and does not alter the coded concept. This matches 213953002; other role-based variants (passenger, pedestrian) or mechanism changes are less appropriate."
275732003,Peak flow rate normal (finding),PEFR normal,"Using the abbreviation 'PEFR' for peak expiratory flow rate, this entry asserts normality of that specific parameter, fitting the Clinical finding 'Peak flow rate normal' (275732003). No extra attributes (e.g., timing, severity, etiology) are present. Parent categories that encompass other pulmonary function measures would be too broad, and sibling findings indicating abnormal values would contradict the statement. The abbreviation is a standard synonym and is semantically equivalent."
405038001,Swallowing status: pharyngeal phase (observable entity),Status—swallowing (pharyngeal phase),"This entry denotes the observable 'status' for swallowing, narrowed to the pharyngeal phase, which is the precise meaning of SNOMED CT 405038001 (Observable entity). It does not report a measurement outcome or diagnosis. A more general status would omit phase specificity, and other phases would not align with the pharyngeal focus, confirming this as the best-matching concept."
260435004,C1-C2 right lateral (qualifier value),R lateral C1–C2,"“R lateral” is a common abbreviation for “right lateral,” paired with the C1–C2 level, and it does not imply any imaging view, procedure, or condition. This remains a Qualifier value. The exact code is 260435004 “C1-C2 right lateral (qualifier value).” A parent concept like “Right lateral” without specifying C1–C2 is less precise, while siblings such as “C1–C2 left lateral” or other levels would not match. The abbreviation is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
701602006,Migraine-therapy vagus nerve electrical stimulator (physical object),Vagus nerve electrical stimulator for migraine therapy,"This entry describes an electrical stimulator of the vagus nerve intended specifically for migraine therapy. The primary concept is the device itself, aligning with the Physical object category. The wording mirrors the fully specified name’s elements—vagus nerve, electrical stimulation, and migraine therapy—making SCTID 701602006 the most precise code. General parent concepts for nerve stimulators or vagus nerve stimulators without indication would be too broad, and child or sibling concepts implying implantation or non-invasive delivery are not stated and thus inappropriate. The phrasing doesn’t add extraneous attributes."
260601006,Via femoral vein (qualifier value),Operative approach via femoral vein,"This specifies the operative approach is via the femoral vein, functioning strictly as a route qualifier without side, technique, or other modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It matches 260601006 Via femoral vein (qualifier value) as it identifies the femoral vein route. The descriptor ""operative approach"" is contextual but clinically equivalent to route/approach and does not change the code. Parent concepts like generic venous route are overly broad, sibling alternative routes (e.g., femoral artery) are excluded, and laterality-specific children are not implied by the wording."
706949007,Free cortisone (substance),Non-protein-bound cortisone,"This terminology describes cortisone in its free (non–protein-bound) state, which is clinically synonymous with 'free cortisone.' It represents a Substance and matches SNOMED CT 706949007. No additional attributes such as amount, route, or timing are present, thus avoiding procedure/product mappings. The parent substance 'cortisone' is too general, and siblings like 'free cortisol' are different compounds."
115624000,Gamma chlordane (substance),Patient brought in container labeled gamma chlordane,"This narrative mentions a container label but the only identifiable medical concept is the substance gamma chlordane; no exposure, poisoning, or measurement is stated. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The precise match is Gamma chlordane (substance) [115624000], as the gamma isomer is explicitly named. Broader chlordane or other isomers would not fit the wording. The contextual detail about a container does not introduce a different codeable concept."
440136004,Specimen from cranium (specimen),Cranial specimen,"“Cranial” here modifies specimen to indicate the origin site is the cranium. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The synonym “cranial” is a common adjectival form of cranium and does not introduce any additional attributes. No tissue type, method, or substructure (e.g., calvarium) is implied, making children inappropriate. The precise concept is Specimen from cranium (440136004)."
1380132006,Union for International Cancer Control LVX (qualifier value),Pathology synoptic: UICC LVX for LVI,"The entry places the UICC LVX code in a pathology synoptic context, specifying it applies to lymphovascular invasion. The main concept is UICC LVX, with the context not adding clinical attributes beyond the qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It most precisely matches SCTID 1380132006 since LVX is explicitly given and tied to UICC. Alternatives such as LX or VX (single-component invasion) or LV0/LV1 would misstate the status. The mention of 'pathology synoptic' is contextual and does not change code selection."
16094831000119100,History of malignant phyllodes neoplasm of breast (situation),Clinical history: malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast,"Stating 'clinical history' ensures this is a past situation, not a current diagnosis, with the condition defined as malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. The category is Situation with explicit context. 'Tumor' and 'neoplasm' are clinically equivalent here. This entry should code to the history-of concept, not to an active malignant phyllodes tumor disorder. It is more granular than a parent 'history of malignant neoplasm of breast' and avoids sibling concepts lacking malignancy detail."
1365939009,Failed attempted medical induction of labor with oxytocin (situation),Failed to achieve labor with oxytocin induction,"The statement indicates an induction attempt using oxytocin and failure to achieve labor, which is the essence of 'Failed attempted medical induction of labor with oxytocin'. This maps to a Situation because it describes the clinical state and outcome, not a successful procedure. Broader 'failed induction' or non-oxytocin agents would be less specific, so this concept is the most precise fit."
229788003,hours/day (qualifier value),Selected unit qualifier: hours/day,"The phrase explicitly chooses 'hours/day' as the unit qualifier, which is a Qualifier value. No numerical or clinical attribute is added. This is best coded as hours/day (qualifier value) 229788003. Broader or sibling units like 'hours' alone or 'minutes/day' would be less appropriate given the wording."
257692005,Rooming house (environment),Address environment: rooming house,"This documents the environmental nature of the address as a rooming house, focusing solely on environment. No extra attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The exact match is Rooming house (environment) SCTID 257692005. Using a parent concept (e.g., dwelling or residential environment) would lose specificity, and sibling environments (boarding house, hostel, apartment) do not match the stated term."
258656009,Whole milk specimen (specimen),Clinical specimen — whole milk,"The entry describes a clinical specimen and specifies whole milk as the material, without species or processing qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. Whole milk specimen (specimen) [258656009] precisely captures a specimen of whole milk. A generic Milk specimen would be too broad, and related concepts like Human milk or Low-fat milk specimens are not indicated. The clinical context is just setting; it does not alter the specimen type."
223732003,Orange Free State (geographic location),Origin: Orange Free State (OFS),"This text names Orange Free State and includes the common abbreviation OFS, maintaining the same geographic location concept. SNOMED CT category: Location – Geographical location. The best code is SCTID 223732003 because both the expanded and abbreviated forms refer to the identical region. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings (like Free State) would alter the place. The abbreviation is a clinically safe synonym that does not change code selection."
785322008,Product containing rhenium and/or rhenium compound (product),Product containing rhenium and/or rhenium compound,"The main concept is a manufactured product whose ingredients include rhenium element and/or any rhenium compound; no other attributes (dose, route, radioisotope, brand) are expressed. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This exactly matches SCTID 785322008, which is defined for products containing rhenium and/or rhenium compounds. More general parents like generic product or product containing chemical are too broad, and children such as product containing rhenium only or product containing rhenium compound only are too narrow. The wording is the preferred term and is an exact fit."
707815009,Immediately after addition of normal plasma (qualifier value),0 minutes post normal plasma addition,"Specifying '0 minutes' is a standardized way to indicate immediacy, aligning with the concept 'immediately after addition of normal plasma'. This is a Qualifier value used to mark the exact timepoint relative to the addition. It matches SCTID 707815009 and avoids any implication of delayed measurement or incubation. Parent concepts lacking the 'immediate/0-minute' specificity or siblings tied to different timepoints are less appropriate."
75926004,"Lighter, device (physical object)",Lighter identified,"The main concept is a lighter device, with identification context but no attributes that would imply a specific subtype or purpose. This fits “Lighter, device (physical object)” SCTID 75926004 in the Physical object—Device hierarchy. Parents like “Device” are too general, and children (e.g., cigarette lighter) would add unwarranted detail. The wording is a neutral paraphrase that leaves the device concept intact and unmodified."
1187196008,Saint Pierre and Miquelon (geographic location),Place: Saint Pierre and Miquelon,"“Place:” is a generic contextual heading, with the actual coded value being the geographic location Saint Pierre and Miquelon. No extra patient-specific attributes are added. In SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location. The SCTID 1187196008 specifically identifies the named location; choosing a parent (Geographic location) or a child (individual island or city) would be inaccurate. The label is neutral and does not alter semantic scope."
6281000146102,Trichosporon faecale (organism),Microbiology taxonomy entry: Trichosporon faecale,"This entry reflects a taxonomy record naming Trichosporon faecale. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It strictly denotes the species without clinical context, ensuring the species-level organism concept is chosen rather than any parent genus or different organism concept."
225874001,No thoughts about dying (situation),"Patient states, ""I am not thinking about dying.""","A direct patient quote negating thought content about dying matches 'No thoughts about dying.' It is a Situation with explicit context due to explicit negation. The use of 'thinking' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'thoughts' and does not alter the code selection. Concepts referencing suicide, fear, or death (rather than dying) would be less precise, making 225874001 the correct code."
67387001,"Coronary perfusion catheter, device (physical object)",Coronary perfusion catheter on sterile field,"This statement confirms the presence of a coronary perfusion catheter in the operative setting without introducing procedure steps or device subtypes. It aligns with the physical object (Device) category and maps to SCTID 67387001. The perfusion function is inherent to the device named; general coronary catheters or different-function catheters (angiography, guide, aspiration) are not equivalent to a perfusion catheter."
719176000,Partner alive (situation),Confirms partner alive.,"This entry indicates confirmation that the partner is alive, focusing solely on living status. It is a Situation concept. The right SNOMED CT code is 719176000 |Partner alive (situation)|. There is no implication of marital specifics, death, or other family roles, so parent or sibling concepts are less accurate. The wording is a valid paraphrase that preserves the meaning."
15929581000119100,Long-term current use of antidepressant medication (situation),On long-term antidepressants at present,"This phrase indicates present (current) use and long-term duration, with the drug class 'antidepressants' clearly specified. The main concept is active, long-standing antidepressant medication use, which is a Situation. 'At present' maintains the current use attribute. This aligns precisely with 'Long-term current use of antidepressant medication.' Broader or different-class concepts would not capture the specificity, and entries about past use or short-term use would be inappropriate."
767396006,Product containing metallic compound (product),Product that includes a metallic compound,"This entry identifies a product whose ingredient makeup includes a metallic compound, with no mention of the specific metal or any clinical use details. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 767396006 is the most precise code reflecting the inclusion of a metallic compound. A parent like Product is too broad, and any child tied to a specific metallic compound would be too narrow. 'Includes' is a clinically equivalent synonym to 'contains' and does not change code selection."
258239006,First revised edition (qualifier value),Orientation packet—first revised edition,"This conveys the qualifier 'first revised edition' for an orientation packet. It belongs to the Qualifier value hierarchy, and SCTID 258239006 is the precise code. Mentioning the packet is contextual only; parent concepts are too general and siblings differ in ordinal designation."
730976003,Entire Nervus spinosus (body structure),Radiology note: course of the nervus spinosus visualized,"The radiology context indicates visualization of the nerve’s course but names the specific structure, nervus spinosus, a Body structure. It aligns with 'Entire Nervus spinosus' and avoids mapping to parent nerves or other skull base structures. The wording introduces no pathology, laterality, or procedural detail beyond observation, keeping the selection focused on the anatomical entity."
21661000175101,Antibiotic prophylaxis not prescribed (situation),Antibiotic prophylaxis prescription not provided.,"The statement asserts that a prescription for antibiotic prophylaxis was not provided, synonymous with not prescribing prophylactic antibiotics. The central concept is the non-prescription of prophylactic antibiotics, with no added attributes. It is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 21661000175101 precisely represents this. Sibling concepts that imply reasons (e.g., contraindicated, declined) or different actions (not administered) are not supported, and a generic medication-not-prescribed parent would be less specific than the prophylaxis-targeted concept."
242624004,Bite of hippopotamus (event),Patient reports hippopotamus bite,"A patient-reported statement indicates the event of being bitten by a hippopotamus. The phrasing does not add attributes like timing, severity, or injury outcome. SNOMED CT category: Event. It maps cleanly to Bite of hippopotamus (event), SCTID 242624004. Parent concepts (Animal bite) are too general, and sibling species bites are not applicable. Disorder codes would be inappropriate, as the entry describes the event rather than resulting injuries. The documentation context (“patient reports”) does not change the concept selection."
785325005,Product containing oxygen radioisotope (product),Oxygen radioisotope product — nuclear medicine,"The phrase identifies a product containing an oxygen radioisotope and situates it in a nuclear medicine context without changing the core concept. It remains a Product-level item and matches SNOMED CT 785325005. It does not specify isotope number, dose, route, or form, so child concepts are not warranted. A parent concept for any radioisotope product would be less specific because the entry retains the oxygen qualifier; the context mention does not alter code selection."
420584006,Ultraviolet-absorbing sunglasses (physical object),Inventory: UV-resistant sunglasses,"This inventory listing identifies sunglasses that are resistant to UV, a clinically acceptable synonym for UV-absorbing protection. No additional attributes are present. It is a Physical object. Ultraviolet-absorbing sunglasses (420584006) is the most accurate code because it specifies UV protection in the sunglasses form. Generic sunglasses as a parent are too broad, and relatives like UV-resistant eyewear are not constrained to sunglasses, so the chosen concept fits precisely."
223920008,County Armagh (geographic location),County of Armagh,"“County of Armagh” is a straightforward paraphrase of the county’s name, signifying the same geographic entity. No additional attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Geographical location (Location). This aligns precisely with SCTID 223920008. Broader parents like Northern Ireland are not as specific, and siblings such as other counties are not indicated. The phrasing is an equivalent synonym and does not alter the intended concept."
265233006,Spinal nerve root operation (procedure),Spinal nerve root operative intervention,"This entry states a surgical intervention involving the spinal nerve root, aligning with the Procedure hierarchy. “Operative intervention” is synonymous with surgical operation and does not introduce details such as approach, level, laterality, or indication. Therefore, SCTID 265233006 is appropriate. Parent terms that lack the spinal qualifier are too general, while child concepts (decompression, rhizotomy, neurolysis, repair) add specifics not present. Sibling non-operative procedures (e.g., nerve root injection) are ruled out by the adjective “operative,” which signals surgery."
722171005,Diagnostic institution (environment),Service location type: diagnostic institution,"This documents the type of service location and specifies it as a diagnostic institution, which maps to Diagnostic institution (environment), SCTID 722171005. The category is Environment or geographical location. The wording is generic and does not add attributes such as department, modality, or inpatient/outpatient status. A parent like healthcare institution is too broad, while child/sibling entries like laboratory or imaging department are too specific. Consequently, 722171005 is the most accurate code."
309980008,Gastrointestinal surgery department (environment),Evaluated today in the GI surgery department,"The main concept is the GI surgery department environment where the evaluation occurred. The category is Environment. ‘GI’ is a standard shorthand for gastrointestinal; the context does not introduce additional attributes beyond the setting. Parent concepts such as generic departments are too broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., gastroenterology department, general surgery department) would misrepresent the GI surgical scope. The precise match remains SCTID 309980008."
82981000119102,History of negative mammogram performed within last 12 months (situation),Negative mammography result within last 12 months on record.,"This entry states that recorded history shows a negative mammography result within the last 12 months, clearly signaling a past event and timeframe. Key elements: mammography (mammogram), negative result, timing within 12 months, and historical context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 82981000119102 is the best match as it encodes precisely this situation. A general history or a current finding concept would be less accurate. The phrasing remains a valid synonym without adding attributes."
14604008,Blood group antibody Hg^a^ (substance),Transfusion antibody—anti-Hg^a^,"This phrase places anti-Hg^a^ within transfusion medicine, indicating the blood group antibody targeting Hg^a^. The main concept is the specific antibody substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with SCTID 14604008 as the precise code. Parent concepts like 'Transfusion antibody' are too general, and siblings with other antigen targets would not match. The context does not add clinical attributes; it simply situates the substance in its domain."
224847009,Leisure center (environment),Facility type: leisure center,"This entry identifies the facility type and names it as a leisure center, specifying an environmental location. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Environment or geographical location, and the exact match is Leisure center (environment), SCTID 224847009. No additional attributes are present that would warrant a broader parent or a more specific sibling, so 224847009 is the correct mapping."
183989002,Hysterectomy planned (situation),OB/GYN documentation: hysterectomy planned,"This clinician documentation notes a planned hysterectomy, with no further attributes like approach, indication, or timing. It is a Situation concept and fits SNOMED CT 183989002 Hysterectomy planned (situation). A more general parent (Procedure planned) loses specificity. Child concepts that detail the type or method are not applicable. Sibling concepts such as referral, consent, or scheduling would alter the context and are not stated here."
71821003,Essential elements screen (procedure),Essential elements screen on record,"This entry reflects that the essential elements screening procedure appears in the record, still representing the same procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps to SCTID 71821003, not to a request or report-only concept. Parent concepts are overly general, and siblings focused on subsets (trace elements, electrolytes) are inaccurate. No additional attributes are conveyed."
1290133002,Point source pollution (environment),Point-source pollution identified,"The wording confirms identification of pollution from a single discrete source and adds only a detection verb. Main concept: point source pollution. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 1290133002 is the exact match for this environmental state. A parent such as generic pollution would miss the defining point-source attribute; children specifying medium or type are not stated, and siblings like nonpoint source pollution would contradict 'point-source.'"
54375002,Oncogene protein LYL (substance),LYL protein (oncogene-derived),"This phrasing emphasizes the protein’s origin from an oncogene, specifically LYL, making it semantically equivalent to the LYL oncogene protein substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, best matched by Oncogene protein LYL (SCTID 54375002). It does not introduce timing, severity, mutation, or procedural attributes, so neither a parent concept nor any sibling/child concept is more appropriate."
214347003,"Motor vehicle traffic accident due to motor vehicle failing to make curve, without collision on the highway, passenger of motor vehicle injured (event)","Clinician documentation: Non-collision motor vehicle traffic accident on the highway, passenger injured, vehicle failed to make the curve.","This documentation explicitly includes non-collision status, motor vehicle traffic accident on a highway, failure to make curve, and passenger injury. These attributes uniquely map to the Event SCTID 214347003. A parent concept would omit one or more qualifiers, and sibling concepts specifying collision or driver involvement would be incorrect here."
2081004,Hospital ship (environment),Observation documented on hospital ship,"The entry states the observation was documented on a hospital ship, specifying location context. This maps directly to Hospital ship (environment), SCTID 2081004 (Environment). More general maritime locations are insufficiently specific, and land-based hospital environments are semantically incorrect. No additional attributes are introduced; only the environment is specified."
702266004,Gas chromatography analyzer column (physical object),Gas chromatography column used in analyzer,"This wording specifies a column used in a gas chromatography analyzer, pointing directly to the GC analyzer column concept 702266004. The main concept is a physical object, with no added attributes regarding configuration, performance, or specifications. The SNOMED category is Physical object. Parent concepts like generic chromatography columns lack modality specificity, and siblings like LC columns are excluded by the mention of gas chromatography. The entry does not introduce child subtype details, making it the precise match to the general GC analyzer column."
310348003,Seen by psychologist (finding),History documents that the patient was seen by a psychologist.,"This describes the historical record that a psychologist saw the patient, and does not add detail about therapy or testing. It is a Clinical finding and matches Seen by psychologist (finding) [310348003]. Parent concepts are overly general, and siblings related to referral or care management would misrepresent the entry. The 'history documents' wording provides context without altering the core finding."
223605000,Middle east country (geographic location),Country within the Middle East,"This entry specifies a country situated within the Middle East, matching 'Middle east country' (SCTID: 223605000) in the Location (geographic location) hierarchy. It maintains country-level granularity without naming a specific nation, avoiding child concept selection. It is more specific than the region alone and does not imply city or subnational areas, so parent and sibling concepts are less suitable. The phrasing is semantically equivalent."
112597000,Betula lutea (organism),Reported species name: Betula lutea,"The statement provides the species name Betula lutea, unambiguously referencing the organism concept 112597000 in SNOMED CT. The report context adds no attributes that would shift coding to a different hierarchy. Broader parents and sibling species are excluded by the exact binomial, making the species-level concept the most precise and correct match."
216391001,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, airport (environment)",Patient reports the accident happened at the airport,"The patient statement identifies the accident’s location as the airport, matching 'Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, airport (environment)'. The main medical concept is the place-of-occurrence attribute for an accident with the environment specified as airport, without any added mechanism or timing. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (environment). This is exact and excludes parent generality or sibling locations. The narrative form is semantically equivalent and maintains the same code."
223660007,Belgium (geographic location),Belgium (geographic location),"The entry restates the preferred term with its semantic tag, explicitly anchoring the meaning to the geographic location class. Category: Location—Geographic location. This directly matches SNOMED CT Belgium (geographic location), SCTID 223660007, and avoids implying nationality, residence, or travel. More general parents (e.g., Europe) or more specific children (e.g., provinces or cities) are not referenced, making this the exact concept."
130918003,4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase (substance),4-chlorobenzoate-CoA synthetase,"This synonym uses “synthetase,” commonly applied to acyl-CoA-forming ligases, and refers to the same enzyme entity as 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA ligase. The category is Substance, and SCTID 130918003 is still the most specific match. Choosing a general acyl-CoA synthetase or a different substrate-specific enzyme would be less precise. The synonym does not add attributes and is clinically equivalent."
716798001,Porch Index of Communicative Ability score (observable entity),Porch Index of Communicative Ability score per SLP,"Main concept: PICA score; ‘per SLP’ is a documentation context indicating the discipline. No attributes of the score (value, severity, subscale) are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The observable entity remains the PICA score, so SCTID 716798001 is exact. Parent concepts are too general and siblings tied to other instruments are excluded. This does not imply the procedure or a subscore (child concept)."
442064002,Eritrea (geographic location),Location: Eritrea,"The entry specifies Eritrea as a location value without asserting relationships such as birthplace or travel. The SNOMED category is Location. The accurate code is Eritrea (geographic location), SCTID 442064002. Using a parent concept would be insufficiently specific, while any child or sibling would be incorrect. The 'Location:' label provides context and does not alter the coding target."
223721003,Peru (geographic location),Perú,"This is the Spanish-language form of the country name, referring to the same geographic entity as the English 'Peru.' No attributes beyond the location are introduced. In SNOMED CT this is a Location (Geographic location), matched by Peru (geographic location) 223721003. Using the accented local spelling is a clinically and semantically equivalent synonym and does not change the intended concept; parents and siblings are not more appropriate."
223870007,Cleveland (geographic location),Origin: Cleveland,"“Origin” here is contextual, specifying that the place is Cleveland; the concept to code remains the geographic location Cleveland. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). Cleveland (geographic location), SCTID 223870007, is appropriate because no additional qualifiers or alternative entities (e.g., counties, hospitals) are present. Parent geographic location concepts are too broad, and narrower children like “Cleveland, Ohio” are not supported by the entry."
217920006,Accidentally cut or pierced by machinery (event),Patient reports accidental puncture by machinery,"This patient statement documents an accidental puncture mechanism involving machinery. The main concept is accidental pierce/puncture by machinery as an external cause event. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 217920006 fits because it encompasses accidental cut or pierced by machinery. Broader machinery accidents would be too general, and other mechanism events would not match. 'Puncture' is equivalent to 'pierced' and does not change the intended concept or add new attributes."
52424002,Provocative test (procedure),Provocative test conducted in clinic,"This describes performance of a provocative test in a clinic setting, which remains the same procedure concept. The primary concept is the provocative test procedure, categorized as a Procedure. SNOMED CT 52424002 is the precise code because the entry stays generic, without detailing stimulus, target organ, or condition. Parent concepts are overly broad; child/sibling specific provocation tests would be inappropriate due to absent specifics. The setting (‘in clinic’) is contextual and does not affect the procedure coding."
223819003,Islands of Greece (geographic location),Origin: Islands in Greece,"The label “Origin” functions as a context tag; the content “Islands in Greece” denotes the aggregate islands belonging to Greece. The entry refrains from introducing specific subgroups or other attributes. In SNOMED CT the concept is a Geographic location, and SCTID 223819003 “Islands of Greece” is the precise match. Parent concepts like “Greece” include mainland regions and are too broad, while children such as “Ionian Islands” or “Aegean Islands” are too narrow. The paraphrase is equivalent and maintains coding fidelity."
249570003,Gallbladder palpable on inspiration (finding),Abdominal palpation finding: gallbladder palpable on inspiration,"This specifies that during abdominal palpation, the gallbladder is palpable with inspiration. The category is Clinical finding. SCTID 249570003 is the precise match, as it denotes palpability of the gallbladder specifically on inspiration. A generalized palpability finding would be less exact, and sibling signs like Murphy (pain) or Courvoisier (painless enlargement/obstruction) would miscode added attributes. The wording is a synonymous and contextually framed description without changing the core meaning."
217943002,Accident caused by thresher (event),Accident due to grain thresher,"This entry is an accidental event with a grain thresher specified as the causative device, and it does not introduce injury findings or timing. A grain thresher is a thresher, so the synonym preserves equivalence. It should be coded to Accident caused by thresher (event), SCTID 217943002, in the SNOMED CT Event category. Parent codes for general machinery accidents would be less precise, and siblings for different agricultural machines would be inaccurate. The statement does not imply a disorder or a past history situation."
96241008,Fenethylline (substance),Fenethylline (substance),"The term explicitly presents the chemical as a substance, with no administration, detection, or product role implied. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 96241008 is the exact concept label. Using parent or sibling substance groups would be less specific, and any medicinal product or pharmaceutical form would add attributes not stated here."
1259942006,Healthcare service performing procedure (observable entity),Recording performing service for procedure,This documentation-oriented phrasing indicates the data element capturing which healthcare service performed the procedure. It contains no values or extra attributes. It is an Observable entity and maps precisely to SCTID 1259942006. Choosing a provider or organization performer concept would be incorrect because the focus remains on the service. The wording is a paraphrase of the preferred term and is clinically equivalent.
281833003,Entire hematological system (body structure),Examined system: entire hematologic system,"This examination context identifies the examined system as the entire hematologic system, which is a Body structure. SCTID 281833003 accurately captures the whole-system scope. Parent concepts lack specificity regarding 'entire,' and child structures (e.g., specific organs) are not mentioned. The entry does not add disease, function, or laterality, keeping it aligned strictly with the anatomical system."
224871002,University (environment),Event location: university,"“Event location: university” designates the place of interest as a university without describing the event itself. The main concept is environment/place. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This maps directly to University (environment) [224871002], steering clear of general parents like Educational institution and avoiding siblings (school/college). No child subcomponents (e.g., campus, dormitory) are specified."
31319008,Endoscopic destruction of lesion of anus (procedure),Endoscopic destruction of a lesion at the anus,"The phrase conveys destruction of an anal lesion using endoscopy. Concepts: procedure (destruction), approach (endoscopic), site (anus). Category: Procedure. SCTID 31319008 is the exact match, combining the endoscopic technique with the anal lesion target. Parent procedures like general anal lesion destruction without approach are less specific, and alternatives like excision or biopsy are incorrect because the verb 'destruction' is used. The inclusion of 'a lesion' does not add a count attribute beyond a single target and remains within the concept scope."
328682001,Gluten-free bread mix (product),Pantry inventory: gluten-free bread mix,"The inventory item listed is gluten-free bread mix; the concept is the product itself. Category: Product. This entry corresponds to SNOMED CT 328682001, as it precisely identifies a bread mix formulated to be gluten-free. It does not introduce packaging, quantity, or brand attributes, nor does it reference different gluten-free products. The context is inventory, but the coded entity remains the product, supporting precise mapping."
768753000,Product containing isoquinoline (product),Pharmacy inventory item — product containing isoquinoline,"This entry describes an inventory item in the pharmacy that is a product containing isoquinoline, without any specification of dose, route, or formulation. The main concept is a product containing isoquinoline. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps to SCTID 768753000, reflecting a product-level concept. The inventory context does not add clinical attributes that would change the code, and it avoids the substance concept or any child clinical drug presentation. The wording preserves the intended general product semantics."
767129002,Structure of lymphatic system of left upper limb (body structure),Left upper extremity lymphatic network,"Using 'lymphatic network' denotes the interconnected system of lymphatic structures in the limb. The laterality (left) and region (upper extremity) are clear. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This matches SCTID 767129002 by encompassing the entire lymphatic system of the left upper limb. It does not restrict to subcomponents and thus avoids child mappings, and it is more specific than a non-lateralized parent. No extra attributes are introduced."
16223931000119106,Vitreous humor specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure (specimen),Lab received: vitreous gel FNA specimen,"This lab intake note states the specimen is vitreous gel and that it was obtained by FNA. Main concept: specimen; attributes: vitreous gel (synonym for vitreous humor) and fine needle aspiration. Category: Specimen. SNOMED CT 16223931000119106 precisely represents a vitreous specimen collected by FNA. A more general vitreous specimen code would miss the method, and procedure codes would misclassify the entry. 'Vitreous gel' is a clinically accepted synonym for vitreous humor and does not change code selection."
1163345007,Adrenocorticotropic hormone and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone derivative (substance),Order specifies: ACTH and/or ACTH derivative,"The text notes an order context, but the specified item is a substance: ACTH or any ACTH derivative. Category: Substance. This still maps best to SCTID 1163345007 because it names the union set of hormone and derivative. A child concept for ACTH alone or a particular derivative would be too specific; parent classes are too general. No dose, route, or test attributes are included."
223586009,Brunei Darussalam (geographic location),Place: Brunei Darussalam,"This formulation presents Brunei Darussalam as the referenced place, which aligns with the country-level geographic entity. The main concept is the sovereign state. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. ‘Place’ is a generic contextual label that does not redirect to a parent concept; the text does not specify any sublocation (child) or a different nation (sibling). Hence SCTID 223586009 correctly captures the location."
700194007,Discharge from community care service (procedure),Community care service discharged patient,"This documentation style indicates the patient was discharged specifically by the community care service. Main concept: discharge from community care service. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It exactly matches SCTID 700194007, as it specifies the service setting. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., hospital discharge, discharge planning) are less appropriate. The phrase is a clinically equivalent paraphrase."
284639000,Structure of umbilical portion of portal vein (body structure),Portal vein umbilical portion,"This concise phrasing identifies the umbilical portion associated with the portal vein, specifying the anatomical subsegment. It is a Body structure and correctly maps to SCTID 284639000. The absence of qualifiers prevents misclassification to broader portal vein structures or different portions, avoiding parent/sibling codes."
122552005,Arterial blood specimen (specimen),Arterial blood sample,"This phrase uses 'sample' as a clinically interchangeable synonym for 'specimen' in laboratory contexts, while retaining the arterial origin and blood matrix. The main concept is a specimen entity, placing it within the SNOMED CT Specimen hierarchy. It matches 122552005 because it specifies arterial blood. More general parents like Blood specimen are insufficiently specific, and children adding properties (e.g., anticoagulant, whole vs. plasma) are not implied here. The synonym does not change code selection."
466467006,Biopsy punch (physical object),Biopsy punch selected for procedure,"The entry indicates selection of the biopsy punch as the instrument, clearly a physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Selection context does not alter the device identity, so SCTID 466467006 applies. It avoids additional attributes, making children or siblings less appropriate, and is more specific than a generic 'punch device'."
7562007,Radioisotope study of endocrine system (procedure),Nuclear endocrine scan,"This is a nuclear medicine scan targeting the endocrine system using radioisotopes. Category: Procedure. 'Scan' is a common synonym for imaging study and does not add attributes. Because it specifies the endocrine system but no specific gland, it maps precisely to SCTID 7562007 rather than a generic nuclear scan or thyroid/parathyroid-specific child concepts."
297643009,Duala language (qualifier value),Communication language: Duala,"This entry records the communication language as Duala, where the concept is the language value used. The context 'Communication language' is a field label, not a different clinical concept such as fluency or need for services. Within SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value and is best represented by 'Duala language (qualifier value)'. A parent concept like 'Language (qualifier value)' is overly broad, and siblings (other language codes) would not match the term. The wording does not add attributes like proficiency or regional variants, so 297643009 fits precisely."
362015004,Entire foramen ovale of heart (body structure),Heart foramen ovale (entire),"This entry identifies the foramen ovale in the heart and specifies entire, matching the complete anatomical entity. Category: Body structure. It avoids confusion with the cranial foramen ovale and does not imply any clinical condition. Parent or sibling structures (e.g., atrial septum, fossa ovalis) are not exact matches, and part-based concepts are too granular. Therefore, SCTID 362015004 is correct."
12239004,Throat clearing (observable entity),Throat clearing recorded in chart,"This indicates that the observable act of throat clearing was entered into the record, maintaining the concept without adding clinical features. It corresponds to Throat clearing (Observable entity, SCTID 12239004). Selecting a broader or different semantic type (e.g., clinical finding) would be less accurate, and related siblings (coughing) are not implied. The documentation context is neutral with respect to code selection."
346633004,Phenylketonuria flour and mixes (product),Diet includes PKU flour and mixes,"This clinical documentation notes inclusion of the PKU flour and mixes in the patient’s diet, but the product concept remains central. SNOMED CT category: Product. The specified item is the PKU flour and mixes group, matching SCTID 346633004. There are no additional attributes such as severity, dosage, or brand. Parent dietetic product categories are too broad, and sibling or child products (e.g., specific PKU bread mix) are too narrow. The use statement does not change the code."
217843003,Accidentally struck by falling stone (event),Accidental contact—struck by a falling stone.,"Using “contact” with the clarifier “struck” still conveys an accidental strike event due to a falling stone. The attributes are accidental nature, strike/impact, falling mechanism, and stone object. The best code is SNOMED CT 217843003 Accidentally struck by falling stone (event), an Event concept. Parent concepts for falling objects lack the specified object, and siblings that change the object (e.g., rock, brick) or mechanism (e.g., thrown) would not be accurate. No clinical details beyond the event are introduced."
724153004,Mercaptopurine therapy (procedure),Mercaptopurine-based therapy,"This describes therapy that is based on mercaptopurine as the therapeutic agent, a procedural concept. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Procedure, with the best match being Mercaptopurine therapy (724153004). The phrase 'based on' remains semantically equivalent to therapy with mercaptopurine and does not add attributes like regimen complexity or combination therapy. Broader or sibling concepts would either omit the agent or introduce non-stated specifics, neither of which fit. Thus, the base mercaptopurine therapy procedure is the precise mapping."
433137006,Lithotripsy of gall bladder using fluoroscopic guidance (procedure),Postoperative documentation: gallbladder lithotripsy under fluoroscopy,"Although framed as postoperative documentation, the clinical content is gallbladder lithotripsy using fluoroscopy, which corresponds to SNOMED CT Procedure 433137006. The phrase does not add extra attributes like technique or indication. A parent code without the guidance attribute would be less specific. Sibling procedures with alternative guidance or other anatomical sites are not supported. “Under fluoroscopy” is synonymous with “using fluoroscopic guidance.”"
68545002,Gastric secretion (observable entity),Secretion from the stomach,"This is a paraphrase indicating the stomach’s secretion as an observable entity without additional attributes. Category: Observable entity. The best match is SCTID 68545002 because the phrasing is general and does not constrain the secretion to acid or any particular component or state. Mapping to a parent like secretion (observable entity) would be too generic, and mapping to children such as gastric acid secretion or basal/stimulated secretion would be too specific. The synonym maintains equivalence to 'gastric secretion.'"
216245007,"Sucked into aircraft jet, without accident to aircraft (event)","Patient report: ""I was sucked into a jet engine; the aircraft did not have an accident.""",The patient-reported wording conveys the same event (being sucked into a jet engine) and explicitly excludes any accident involving the aircraft. The main concept is an external cause event; SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 216245007 is the best match because it specifies the event and the absence of aircraft accident. More general or accident-involving codes would be incorrect. The quotation format does not add attributes beyond the concept.
223885001,Humberside (geographic location),Humberside area,"The concept here is Humberside as a geographic area, with 'area' serving as a generic descriptor that does not change the identity or scope of the named place. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). This maps to Humberside (geographic location), SCTID 223885001, because it refers to the same geographic entity without adding qualifiers. Terms implying other jurisdictions or subregions are absent, making parent or sibling concepts less suitable. 'Area' is a neutral synonym in this context and does not alter code selection."
308874008,Entire dorsal branch of spinal nerve of cauda equina (body structure),Examined structure—dorsal branch of cauda equina spinal nerve,"This indicates the examined anatomical structure is the dorsal branch of a spinal nerve of the cauda equina. It remains a Body structure and does not add any attributes beyond identification. The examination context does not alter the core anatomy. Removing the cauda equina qualifier would risk mapping to a broader parent; adding a specific level would create an overly narrow child. The explicit branch (not root, not ventral) confirms SCTID 308874008."
430679000,Family history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (situation),Pedigree indicates family history of type 2 DM,"The phrase indicates that the family pedigree shows a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM). The attributes are familial context and the specified subtype. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This best matches 430679000. A parent concept for unspecified diabetes family history would be less precise, and sibling concepts for type 1 diabetes family history would be inaccurate. The absence of specific relatives prevents mapping to more granular child concepts."
215966000,"Forced landing while taking off, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)",Imaging indication: commercial aircraft crew member injury related to forced landing during takeoff.,"This indication links the injury of a commercial aircraft crew member to a forced landing during takeoff. It matches the SNOMED CT Event that encompasses mechanism, phase, role, and setting. Using ""related to"" does not introduce a distinct causal attribute beyond the defined event. Parent concepts lacking specificity or siblings for passenger/private aircraft would not reflect the documented scenario."
287899006,Hand muscle transplanted (situation),Hand muscle transplant noted,"This entry states that a hand muscle transplant is noted, i.e., the status is recognized, without timing or laterality. It remains a Situation concept. SCTID 287899006 is the exact match since it encodes transplanted hand muscle. Parent concepts would lose the hand site specificity, and siblings/children with different tissues (tendon) or added details (left/right, named muscle) would not fit. The synonym does not introduce new attributes; it conveys the same clinical concept."
247374002,Range of painful joint movement (observable entity),Assessed painful range of joint movement,"This entry indicates the assessment of the specific observable: the range of motion that provokes pain in a joint. It belongs to the Observable entity category and aligns with SNOMED CT 247374002. The wording distinguishes it from a general joint ROM measure (parent) and from a finding of pain with movement (sibling). The synonymic phrasing does not introduce joint site, laterality, severity, timing, or etiology, keeping the code selection precise."
373873005,Pharmaceutical / biologic product (product),Biologic or pharmaceutical product,"Reversing the order to “Biologic or pharmaceutical product” preserves the same meaning, denoting the broad class that covers both product types. The SNOMED CT category is Product. No information is provided that would restrict coding to a narrower child (e.g., Biologic product alone) or a sibling. Because the phrase remains inclusive and nonspecific, 373873005 is the most accurate code. The synonymal phrasing does not introduce additional attributes."
73709001,Blood group antibody hr^B^ (substance),Anti-hrB,"The entry explicitly names the blood group antibody specificity as anti-hrB, which corresponds directly to the SNOMED CT substance concept Blood group antibody hr^B^ (SCTID 73709001). No additional attributes such as class, titer, or clinical context are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, as this is the designation of a specific antibody reagent/species. This is more precise than parent concepts like Blood group antibody and not a sibling such as anti-HrB (uppercase) or anti-e; the lowercase hrB specificity is exact. The term “anti-hrB” is a clinically standard synonym of “blood group antibody hr^B^,” preserving the same code selection."
485319341000119105,History of lactation disorder (situation),History: disorder of lactation,"The entry uses a synonymous phrasing 'disorder of lactation' within a history context, indicating a previous lactation disorder. The category is Situation with explicit context (Situation). It precisely matches SCTID 485319341000119105 because it captures the past history of a lactation disorder and not an active condition. The synonym ‘disorder of lactation’ is clinically equivalent to ‘lactation disorder’ and does not alter code selection. No specific subtype or broader breastfeeding issues are introduced, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate."
224020003,Ontario (geographic location),"Ontario (Canada), provincial area","The entry identifies Ontario within Canada and describes it as a provincial area, matching its administrative status. The main concept is the geographic location Ontario; the descriptors clarify type and national context. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). This maps precisely to Ontario (geographic location) SCTID 224020003. Parent concepts are overly broad, and sibling concepts denote other regions. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
700705005,Non-heated respiratory humidifier (physical object),Patient reports having a non-heated respiratory humidifier,"A patient-reported context still identifies the same physical object: a respiratory humidifier without heating functionality. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The entry avoids naming specific subtypes (e.g., oxygen bottle) and includes the non-heated attribute necessary to avoid the parent or heated sibling. Therefore, it aligns precisely with Non-heated respiratory humidifier."
2541000181108,Leukopheresis product specimen (specimen),Leukapheresis product (specimen),"Parenthetical clarification highlights that the leukapheresis product is a specimen. This is a Specimen concept and fits SCTID 2541000181108. It distinctly avoids mapping to the procedure code and does not add specificity regarding cell content beyond 'leukocyte,' preventing mismatch with children like PBSC products. The phrasing is a direct synonym with no added attributes."
263351007,Structure of lower lacrimal canaliculus (body structure),Inferior canaliculus (lacrimal) structure,"This phrasing clarifies the anatomical structure as the inferior canaliculus of the lacrimal system, staying strictly within structural semantics. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It corresponds to 263351007 because it identifies the lower canaliculus specifically. A parent concept would be nonspecific, and a sibling (upper canaliculus) would not match the 'inferior' descriptor. The parenthetical '(lacrimal)' confirms system context without changing the structure."
251246008,Electrocardiographic complex shape (observable entity),Patient note: “ECG complex shape was discussed.”,"A patient-reported context indicates that the observable 'ECG complex shape' was discussed, but does not introduce values or specify a wave component. Category: Observable entity. The core medical concept remains the shape of the ECG complex, mapping to SCTID 251246008. Contextual language about discussion does not shift the code to a procedure or interpretation, and it avoids broader or narrower related concepts."
411797003,House dust (Greer Labs) diagnostic allergen extract (product),Greer Labs diagnostic extract: house dust allergen.,"Framing it as 'diagnostic extract' with 'house dust allergen' and 'Greer Labs' specifies the branded diagnostic allergen extract product without adding dose, route, or method details. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and the exact code is 'House dust (Greer Labs) diagnostic allergen extract (product)' SCTID 411797003. Parents that omit manufacturer detail or generic allergen products are less specific, and sibling concepts like house dust mite or therapeutic extracts would not match because the text clearly denotes a diagnostic house dust extract by Greer Labs."
309059004,Frozen section breast specimen (specimen),Specimen processed as frozen section: breast,"The wording indicates a specimen whose processing method is frozen section and whose source is the breast. The main concept is a specimen, category Specimen. SCTID 309059004 is the correct code because it combines breast as the source and frozen section as the preparation. A parent concept specifying only the site or only the method would be less specific, and siblings adding procedural or diagnostic details would not match the entry. The phrasing is a synonymous description that maintains the same attributes."
1145403003,Macrocephaly (finding),Assessment: macrocephaly,"The assessment documents macrocephaly, which is a Clinical finding. The precise SNOMED CT concept is Macrocephaly (finding) SCTID 1145403003. It does not introduce etiology, severity, or temporality. Parent concepts (Abnormal head size) are too general, and sibling/child concepts (such as relative macrocephaly or megalencephaly) are not implied. ‘Assessment’ is a documentation context and does not change the semantic content; it remains equivalent to the macrocephaly finding."
223900007,Staffordshire (geographic location),Staffordshire England,"The entry lists the county 'Staffordshire' alongside its country 'England' for context, keeping the focus on Staffordshire as the location. Main concept: Staffordshire; contextual parent geography noted without altering concept identity. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (environment). The correct mapping is 'Staffordshire (geographic location)' SCTID 223900007. Choosing the parent (England) would be too broad, and any sublocality would be too narrow. The wording remains a clinically safe synonym."
80909000,First cranial nerve function (observable entity),Cranial nerve I sensory function,"This entry leverages the inherent sensory nature of CN I, specifying its function as an observable parameter, without outcome descriptors. It fits the Observable entity category and aligns with First cranial nerve function (SCTID 80909000). Adding 'sensory' does not change the concept because CN I is exclusively sensory; parent or sibling concepts involving other nerves or functions would be less accurate."
256389008,Red cells - washed - CMV negative (product),Use CMV-negative washed RBC product,"The directive refers specifically to a red cell blood product that has been washed and is CMV-negative. This fits within the Product hierarchy in SNOMED CT. The concept 256389008 “Red cells - washed - CMV negative (product)” is the most precise match since it combines both attributes. A parent “Red cells (product)” is too broad, and siblings (only washed or only CMV-negative) are incomplete. The abbreviation “RBC” is a clinically equivalent synonym for red cells without altering the coded meaning."
373356002,Evisceration of eye proper (procedure),Removal of intraocular contents with scleral shell preserved,"This phrasing describes the defining steps of ocular evisceration: removing the intraocular contents while preserving the scleral shell. The main concept is a surgical Procedure on the eye proper, accurately represented by SCTID 373356002. It excludes enucleation (entire globe removal) and orbital exenteration (orbit contents), and it introduces no attributes like implant use or laterality, so no child or parent concept is more precise. The descriptive synonym is clinically equivalent to evisceration."
399281004,Fleischner projection (qualifier value),View type: Fleischner projection,"This designates the type of imaging view as 'Fleischner projection', which directly corresponds to the named projection. The category is Qualifier value. SCTID 399281004 is the exact code for the Fleischner projection. Choosing a parent like 'view type' would be insufficiently specific, and other named projections are siblings. 'View type' is a harmless paraphrase indicating a projection without changing the intended code."
167874004,Knee joint synovial fluid (specimen),Source: knee joint synovial fluid,"This entry specifies the specimen source as knee joint synovial fluid, clearly identifying a Specimen. It aligns with SCTID 167874004. While a parent like synovial fluid specimen would not specify the knee, this entry does, making it more precise. Siblings for other joints are excluded by the knee designation. The phrasing does not add attributes such as laterality or procedural details, keeping the concept exact."
306766009,Low - site descriptor (qualifier value),Low site annotation,"This entry conveys an annotation that the anatomical site is described by the qualifier ‘low.’ The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 306766009 suits this precisely, as it is the ‘Low – site descriptor’ qualifier. The text avoids any clinical attribute beyond the positional descriptor and does not suggest severity, measurement, or alternate orientation. Parent and sibling concepts are less specific or different in meaning."
426988006,End tidal desflurane concentration (observable entity),End-tidal desflurane concentration,"The entry names the specific observable: the concentration of desflurane measured at end-tidal expiration. This is an Observable entity and directly corresponds to SNOMED CT concept 426988006. It does not introduce any results, units, timing, or other attributes. More general parent concepts (e.g., end-tidal anesthetic agent concentration) are less precise because they do not specify desflurane, and sibling concepts (e.g., end-tidal sevoflurane concentration) refer to different agents."
441670006,Republic of Serbia (geographic location),Republic of Serbia—country,"This entry uses the preferred country name with a descriptor indicating its type, without adding residency, travel, or temporal details. Category: Geographic location. It aligns exactly with Republic of Serbia (441670006); broader parents like “Country” lose specificity, and other nations or subregions are inappropriate. The type descriptor does not alter the concept being coded."
223562007,Liberia (geographic location),Liberia — country,"This is a concise designation of the country Liberia, with a type descriptor that does not change the referent. Main concept: Liberia (country-level location). SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223562007 is the correct code. Coding to continent or region would be too general; coding to city/province would be too specific. The descriptor “country” avoids introducing clinical attributes."
1157046003,Recombinant non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein (substance),"Chimpanzee adenoviral vector, replication-incompetent, encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike","The phrase specifies a chimpanzee adenoviral vector that is replication-incompetent (a synonym of non-replicating) and encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Category: Substance. The synonyms ‘replication-incompetent’ and ‘encoding’ are clinically equivalent and do not change the intended code selection. Parent concepts omitting chimp origin or replication-defective status would be too general, and siblings such as human adenovirus vectors or constructs encoding non-spike antigens would be mismatched."
281298000,Reference range comments (qualifier value),Reference range comments,"The phrase explicitly denotes the concept of comments pertaining to a reference range. This is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT, matching SCTID 281298000. No additional attributes such as severity, timing, laterality, or associated conditions are introduced; it simply labels a comment type about reference intervals. Parent concepts like generic “comments” would be too broad, while sibling concepts such as “reference range” (an observable entity) or “outside reference range” (a clinical finding/interpretation) are not appropriate because the wording here focuses on the comment itself, not the range or result status."
258519006,Female genital swab (specimen),Microbiology specimen—female genital swab,"This is a microbiology context description of a swab specimen from the female genital region, directly matching Female genital swab (specimen). Category: Specimen. The laboratory context does not introduce new clinical attributes and the specimen is still defined by collection method (swab) and source (female genital). Parent concepts are less specific, and child concepts naming particular subsites are not indicated in the wording."
183194003,Passive wrist extension splint (physical object),Device: passive wrist extension splint,"Explicitly labels the device as a passive wrist extension splint, with the necessary attributes (passive mechanism, wrist target, extension position, splint type). This is a Physical object. The ideal SNOMED CT concept is 183194003 Passive wrist extension splint. Broader device terms or general wrist splints are not as specific, and dynamic extension splints would conflict with 'passive.' This phrasing is a direct, equivalent form."
713779008,"Nitrile examination/treatment glove, non-powdered, sterile (physical object)","Inventory item: sterile nitrile treatment glove, non-powdered","This inventory entry clearly specifies a nitrile treatment glove that is sterile and non-powdered. The category is Physical object. SNOMED 713779008 precisely matches, as it denotes a nitrile examination/treatment glove with sterility and non-powdered attributes. Parent concepts that omit sterility or powder status are insufficiently specific. Sibling concepts (latex, powdered, or non-sterile gloves; surgical gloves) would not fit the stated properties and intended use."
45216005,Iatrogenic death (event),Medically induced death,"“Medically induced death” denotes death resulting from medical care, synonymous with iatrogenic death. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 45216005 is the most accurate match, as it explicitly represents death due to healthcare intervention. A general death code would omit causality, and any sibling focusing on specific procedures (e.g., intraoperative) is too narrow. The wording does not introduce extra attributes beyond the defining cause."
303751004,Musculoskeletal system contrast procedure (procedure),Contrast procedure of the musculoskeletal system,"This wording conveys a procedure that applies contrast to the musculoskeletal system without adding modality, site, or other attributes. Category: Procedure. It cleanly aligns with Musculoskeletal system contrast procedure (303751004). Parent concepts like general contrast procedures omit the system focus, and child concepts (e.g., joint or spine-specific contrast studies) are more detailed than the entry allows. The phrasing is a direct synonym that preserves the same scope."
419581008,Bizarre dreams (finding),Partner notes patient has bizarre dreams,"This entry records the observation that the patient experiences bizarre dreams, a Clinical finding coded as SNOMED CT 419581008. It does not add attributes like fear, enactment, severity, or causation, keeping it distinct from nightmares, REM behavior disorder, or vivid dreams. The use of 'bizarre' maintains specificity, making this concept more precise than a general abnormal dreams parent."
257093004,DQA1*0103 (substance),HLA DQA1*0103 antigen,"This is a stylistic variant that explicitly calls the DQA1*0103 molecular entity an antigen, which in HLA terminology refers to the same substance. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise code is 257093004. More general HLA antigen concepts or different DQA1 star codes would be less accurate. The entry avoids adding attributes such as positivity or clinical context that would necessitate a finding or procedure code."
248814001,Tubular breast (finding),Tubular-shaped breast,"This phrasing captures the same morphological finding, emphasizing the tubular configuration of the breast. It is a Clinical finding and aligns precisely with Tubular breast (finding) [248814001]. It avoids attributes such as bilateral involvement, severity grading, or causation, which would point to other concepts. More general findings of breast abnormality or alternative morphologies are less appropriate given the specific 'tubular' wording. The synonym 'tubular-shaped' is clinically equivalent."
309973006,General dental surgery department (environment),General dental surgery dept.,"Using 'dept.' as an abbreviation does not alter the meaning; it remains a department-level environment for general dental surgery. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This matches the concept precisely because the abbreviation is a common shorthand for 'department' and does not introduce any new attributes or roles. More generic environments (e.g., 'dental department') would be less specific, and related departments like 'maxillofacial surgery' would be incorrect. The entry does not imply services beyond the departmental designation."
419309008,Reading segment height (observable entity),Reading segment height in optical report,"The text points to reading segment height being present as a parameter within an optical report, emphasizing the property itself. This is an Observable entity, correctly mapping to SCTID 419309008. No procedural measurement is implied, and there are no added attributes such as laterality or lens subtype. Sibling parameters like progressive fitting height or near PD are distinct properties, making the selected concept the most precise match."
1335897001,Detection of Retroviridae antibody (observable entity),Retrovirus Ab detection,"This concise lab-analyte label indicates detection of antibodies to retroviruses, i.e., Retroviridae, without introducing method, specimen, or result. It is an Observable entity. SCTID 1335897001 fits best because it is specific to Retroviridae antibody detection, while more general parents are too broad and virus-specific children are too narrow. Siblings such as antigen or nucleic acid detection target different analytes. The abbreviation 'Ab' is a common clinical shorthand for antibody and retains equivalence to the preferred concept."
260532003,Thoracoabdominal (qualifier value),Location qualifier—thoracoabdominal,"By labeling it as a 'location qualifier,' the entry makes clear that the term is being used as a SNOMED Qualifier value indicating a combined thorax-abdomen region. Thoracoabdominal (qualifier value) [260532003] is the precise concept. No additional attributes (severity, laterality, causation, timing) are added. A broader parent like 'location descriptor' loses specificity, and sibling qualifiers for single regions (thoracic, abdominal) are not equivalent to the combined region. This entry does not invoke a structure or approach, keeping it within the qualifier hierarchy."
43419004,Bitter almond oil (substance),Bitter almond oil identified,"The phrase indicates recognition of the substance bitter almond oil, without adding data on quantity, route, or effects. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance and maps directly to Bitter almond oil (substance) SCTID 43419004. Parents like almond oil in general would be too broad, and related substances or products are not mentioned. The entry introduces no timing, severity, or causality information."
165343008,Laboratory test requested - not done (situation),Requested laboratory test was not completed,"The phrasing shows that a laboratory test was requested and that completion did not occur, which is equivalent to 'not done.' This maps directly to SNOMED CT 165343008 (Situation). Choosing this concept is exact because it captures the ordered/requested state plus non-completion. More general parents would ignore the lab context, and siblings or children specifying reasons or particular tests would add attributes not present here. 'Not completed' is a clinically safe synonym for 'not done' without changing code selection."
465677009,Transobturator needle (physical object),"Needle, transobturator","This entry names the device as a needle and clarifies its specific type, transobturator, which denotes the instrument’s intended anatomical route. Category: Physical object. The explicit modifier ensures selection of “Transobturator needle (physical object)” rather than a general needle parent concept. No features such as material, single-use, or association with a tape set are stated, avoiding child or sibling mappings. The phrasing is a standard catalog-style synonym without altering the concept."
412228003,Ioxaglate meglumine (substance),Agent identified: ioxaglate meglumine,"The entry specifies the agent by its chemical name, ioxaglate meglumine, without implying any other components or attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The most precise code is 412228003. Broader or alternative salt concepts (e.g., ioxaglate sodium) do not match the stated meglumine salt. The term “agent” is contextual and does not change the substance coding."
102782009,Hexokinase 1 (substance),History entry: HK-1,"HK-1 is an alternate notation for Hexokinase 1 and identifies the same enzyme substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 102782009 is the exact match because isoform 1 is specified. Parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate given the explicit '1'. The history context does not introduce new attributes, and the entry does not mention tests, gene status, or pathology."
223756004,Okinawa (geographic location),Okinawa,"The entry is a bare place name, making the single explicit concept a geographic location: Okinawa. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the precise code is 223756004 Okinawa (geographic location). No qualifiers such as “prefecture,” “island,” or “city” are present, so more specific child concepts (e.g., Okinawa Prefecture or Okinawa Island) are not implied. Broader parent concepts like Japan or the Ryukyu Islands are not stated. Therefore, this maps cleanly and uniquely to Okinawa (geographic location)."
257658007,Entertainment establishment (environment),Environmental context recorded as entertainment establishment,"This entry records the environmental context as an entertainment establishment, which maps to SNOMED CT 257658007. The main concept is an environment dedicated to entertainment, with no additional attributes such as incident type or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The phrasing avoids specificity that would imply children (cinema, theatre, nightclub) and is more specific than broad environmental parent categories. The documentation wording does not alter the concept choice. Therefore, the entertainment establishment code is the appropriate and most precise match."
129300006,Puncture - action (qualifier value),Follow-up entry: action previously was puncture,"Main concept: prior action noted as puncture. Explicit attributes: action; temporal context only. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value (Action). The time context does not alter the action being coded; the content remains the method 'puncture', which aligns with SCTID 129300006. It avoids mapping to procedure concepts and lacks any site or instrument, keeping it precise."
223668000,Italy (geographic location),Italia,"The entry is the native-language name of the same country, Italy, without extra qualifiers. In SNOMED CT this is a Geographic location in the Location hierarchy. Italia is a recognized synonym that is clinically and semantically equivalent to Italy and does not alter the code selection. Italy (geographic location) SCTID 223668000 precisely matches, whereas parent categories like Country (location) are too general and child/sibling locations (e.g., Rome, France, Europe) would not be correct. No attributes such as residence, travel, or birthplace are implied here."
445745007,Fluid specimen from subphrenic space (specimen),Subphrenic space fluid sample (specimen),"This states a fluid sample and explicitly labels it as a specimen, with source in the subphrenic space. It belongs to the Specimen category. The most accurate SNOMED CT code is 445745007, which captures fluid specimen from the subphrenic space. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings representing other anatomical spaces or pathological fluids are not appropriate. The term ‘sample’ is a standard synonym for ‘specimen’ and doesn’t alter code selection."
7712004,Structure of subdural space of spinal region (body structure),Labeled structure: spinal subdural space,"This entry indicates an anatomical label for the spinal subdural space, corresponding to the body structure concept. The explicit spinal context ensures it does not map to the general parent or the cranial subdural sibling. No additional attributes are present—no disease, no level specifics—so it remains appropriately coded to the intended structure."
223733008,Transvaal (geographic location),From Transvaal,"The main concept referenced is Transvaal, a geographic location; ‘From’ indicates provenance context but does not alter the location itself. In SNOMED CT, this should be coded to Transvaal (geographic location) 223733008 within the Location category. Coding a parent concept would be nonspecific, and children/siblings (e.g., Northern Transvaal or South Africa) would not match the exact place named. The wording does not introduce a different geographic entity."
309988001,Ophthalmology department (environment),Ophthalmology department (environment),"This entry mirrors the fully specified name style, explicitly identifying the environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It is a precise match to 309988001, asserting the departmental environment linked to ophthalmology. Other environment concepts such as clinic, unit, or ward are not indicated and would be inaccurate. The parent department concepts are too general; this entry retains specialty specificity without additional attributes."
217303001,Jump from burning house (event),Jump from burning house,"The entry explicitly denotes the event of jumping from a house that is actively burning. The main concept is the occurrence of a jump from a burning house, with no added details about injuries, height, timing, or intent. This aligns with SNOMED CT category Event and maps precisely to SCTID 217303001 Jump from burning house (event). A parent concept like generic Event is too broad, and sibling concepts such as Jump from building (event) or House fire (event) omit either the burning-house context or the jump action. The compact phrasing is a direct, clinically equivalent expression of the preferred term without introducing new attributes."
768754006,Product containing boron and/or boron compound (product),Product that contains boron or a boron compound,"This entry describes a product designated by its ingredient content, namely boron or a boron compound, without extra qualifiers. It belongs to the Product category and maps to SCTID 768754006, which covers products containing boron and/or boron compounds. Parent concepts that omit ingredient specification are too general, and child concepts naming a particular boron derivative (e.g., borate or boric acid) would be overly specific relative to the text. The paraphrase ""contains boron or a boron compound"" is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
129373007,Plication - action (qualifier value),Plication documented,"This records plication as the documented action, which corresponds to SNOMED CT 129373007 Plication - action under Qualifier value. There is no mention of body site, approach, timing, or related conditions, so it does not imply a specific procedure. A generic action parent lacks specificity, and sibling actions like suturing or ligation represent different techniques, making the plication action concept the most precise code."
736004008,Nebivolol contraindicated (situation),Medication contraindication: nebivolol,"This entry names a medication contraindication and specifies nebivolol, with no added qualifiers. The main concept is a drug-specific contraindication, categorized as a Situation. SCTID 736004008 accurately represents 'Nebivolol contraindicated.' A parent concept such as 'Medication contraindicated' would be overly generic, and sibling concepts for other drugs or drug classes would not match the named agent. Allergy or adverse reaction concepts would introduce a different clinical finding not asserted here. The wording is a precise synonym."
416131009,Erythrocyte feature (observable entity),Feature of red blood cell,"The statement targets a feature of a red blood cell (erythrocyte), without specifying which feature or any result, keeping it at a general observable level. This falls under Observable entity in SNOMED CT. Code 416131009 |Erythrocyte feature| is the precise match because it is the RBC-specific general feature observable. Broader cell-feature concepts would be less specific, and detailed RBC parameters or abnormalities would introduce specifics not present here."
170707004,Fit frequency (observable entity),Fit frequency discussed with patient,"The entry indicates a discussion regarding the specific observable entity of fit frequency, with no values or additional parameters introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It best matches SCTID 170707004 because the focus is the frequency of fits, not an event or diagnosis. Alternative concepts such as fit count or severity are separate properties and would be less accurate. The discussion context is non-clinical metadata and does not change the coding."
257588007,Coastal sea (environment),Sea adjacent to coastline,"The phrase specifies the sea that lies alongside the coastline, directly corresponding to Coastal sea (environment), SCTID 257588007. The concept captured is environmental, with no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This avoids overgeneralization to Sea (environment) and excludes related but distinct siblings such as Shoreline (terrestrial edge) or Open sea (far offshore). The paraphrase maintains the same environmental definition as the preferred term."
115681005,Landsteiner-Wiener blood group system (qualifier value),Component mapping value: Landsteiner-Wiener blood group system,"The wording presents the Landsteiner-Wiener blood group system as a mapping value component, but the essential concept remains the system itself without any additional clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is the Qualifier value for the LW blood group system, matching SCTID 115681005. More general parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling systems are not mentioned. No child antigen or antibody concepts are implied."
223922000,County Down (geographic location),Follow-up to be scheduled in County Down,"The follow-up is planned in 'County Down,' referencing the geographic county. It aligns with County Down (geographic location), SCTID 223922000, category Location (Geographic location). The care context does not change the mapped place. Parents (e.g., Northern Ireland) are broader and less precise, and no child locality is named, ensuring proper county-level coding."
702292006,"Evacuated blood collection tube,tripotassium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid/sodium fluoride (physical object)",Training note: employ an evacuated blood collection tube containing tripotassium EDTA and NaF,"The training note directs use of an evacuated blood collection tube containing tripotassium EDTA and NaF. The category is Physical object. The device corresponds exactly to SCTID 702292006. Using more general or different additive combinations would map to parent or sibling concepts and be less accurate. The use of NaF abbreviation and “tripotassium EDTA” clarifies the specific salt form, ensuring it is not K2EDTA; no other attributes such as volume or brand are implied."
699626009,Structure of back of upper thoracic region (body structure),Upper thoracic posterior back region,"This wording establishes a posterior (back) region within the upper thoracic area, equivalent to the concept 'back of upper thoracic region.' The main concept is an anatomical site. Category: Body structure. It is narrower than the parent thoracic back and does not misclassify into siblings such as lower thoracic back or general upper back. No additional qualifiers are present, supporting SCTID 699626009."
255461004,Rim speckled (qualifier value),Rim speckled,"The entry states the qualifier value ""rim speckled"" exactly, which is a pattern descriptor used in laboratory or diagnostic contexts. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the most precise match is SCTID 255461004 Rim speckled (qualifier value). This does not introduce attributes such as titer, timing, severity, or associated conditions. More general parents like ""speckled"" or ""rim"" would be less precise, and siblings like ""coarse speckled"" or ""fine speckled"" are not implied. The wording aligns directly with the named qualifier without altering its meaning."
300190006,Middle ear fistula sign negative (situation),ENT exam: middle ear fistula sign negative,This entry anchors the context to an ENT examination and reports a negative middle ear fistula sign. The main concept is the negative fistula sign specific to the middle ear. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 300190006 is the most precise match. Parent or sibling concepts that are generic to exam findings or that denote positivity are less appropriate. 'ENT exam' is contextual and does not introduce attributes like laterality or cause.
249753008,Glove size (observable entity),Glove size to document,"This indicates that the glove size attribute is the item to document, but the concept remains the observable property 'glove size.' Category: Observable entity. SCTID 249753008 aligns with the attribute. No numeric value or specific glove subtype is provided, avoiding more specific child concepts, and it is not a general size concept of an object, so a parent would be less precise. Sibling concepts covering other item sizes are not applicable."
399133000,Left ventricular peak early diastolic tissue velocity (observable entity),LV peak early diastolic tissue velocity,"The abbreviation LV retains the anatomic site (left ventricle), and the phrase specifies peak tissue velocity in early diastole. The concept is an Observable entity measured via tissue Doppler. This aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 399133000, not with parent observables that lack timing/peak specificity or with sibling observables that refer to different cardiac phases (e.g., systolic or late diastolic). The shorthand does not introduce any new attribute; it is a clinically standard synonym."
1340203001,Ectoparasite specimen (specimen),External parasite sample,"“External parasite” is a direct synonym for “ectoparasite,” and “sample” is synonymous with “specimen” in lab contexts. The entry asserts the specimen is an external parasite, mapping to SNOMED CT 1340203001 Ectoparasite specimen (Specimen). It avoids specific organism naming, host site, and process attributes, making narrower children inappropriate. The explicit ectoparasite term makes broader parents too general."
401317007,Shuttle walking test done (situation),Shuttle walking test performed,"The wording indicates the shuttle walking test was performed, which is functionally equivalent to being done or completed. The concept is the shuttle walking test with the performed/done status attribute. This maps to the Situation category in SNOMED CT: “Shuttle walking test done (situation)” (401317007). Using a more general parent like “Procedure performed (situation)” would be too broad, and selecting a sibling such as “Six-minute walk test performed (situation)” would be incorrect given the explicit shuttle test. No child variant (e.g., incremental specification) is included, so the base shuttle walking test done concept is the most precise."
130812001,Branched-chain-2-oxoacid decarboxylase (substance),E1 decarboxylase of branched-chain 2-oxoacids,"The decarboxylase component is commonly referred to as the E1 activity in the branched-chain ketoacid pathway; this wording identifies the same enzyme without specifying alpha or beta subunits or implying complex membership beyond the decarboxylase role. It remains a Substance, matching SCTID 130812001. Choosing a parent like generic decarboxylase would be less precise, and child concepts referring to specific subunits (e.g., E1 alpha) would be overly specific and not stated. Sibling concepts like the dehydrogenase complex as a whole are different entities."
224662009,Flat over shop (environment),Flat above shop,"The wording identifies a flat located above a shop, describing a residential environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. 224662009 is the best fit since it encodes specifically a flat situated over a shop. Mapping to “Flat (environment)” would omit the shop context, and mapping to “Shop (environment)” would omit the residential component. No extra qualifiers (e.g., size, occupants) are provided, keeping the concept precise."
16223491000119100,Tissue specimen obtained by transtracheal biopsy (specimen),Transtracheal biopsy tissue specimen,"This concise phrase states both the biopsy method (transtracheal) and the specimen type (tissue), mapping directly to SNOMED CT 16223491000119100 under the Specimen hierarchy. It does not introduce a site, material processing, or procedural details beyond the method, thereby avoiding parent concepts like generic tissue specimens and sibling concepts such as transbronchial tissue specimens or transtracheal aspirates. The synonym order is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not change the code selection."
175873005,Declotting of thigh vein loop (procedure),Thigh venous loop declotting,"Using “venous” as a synonym for “vein,” this entry describes the declotting of a venous loop in the thigh. The main concept is a Procedure targeting a thigh venous loop to remove clot, which matches Declotting of thigh vein loop (175873005). Parent concepts lacking the thigh detail would be too general, and siblings involving other limb regions would be incorrect. The term does not add method, laterality, or indications, so it is a clinically equivalent paraphrase."
468261002,Metal dental bridge with polymer coating (physical object),Metal tooth bridge with polymer coating,The device described is a metal dental (tooth) bridge with a polymer coating. Category: Physical object. 'Tooth bridge' is a colloquial wording for a dental bridge and does not change the concept. The inclusion of the polymer coating attribute makes SCTID 468261002 the precise match. Parent concepts that omit coating or siblings involving non-polymer coatings do not fit the wording. No additional attributes like location or unit count are implied.
223370001,Curacao (geographic location),Site: Curacao,"Curacao is recorded as a site, using the non-diacritic spelling. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The generic label “Site” conveys the same geographic place without additional attributes, so Curaçao (geographic location) SCTID 223370001 is the most accurate code. More general or more specific related concepts are not implied."
65398004,African horse sickness virus 5 (organism),AHSV type 5,"This entry uses the acronym AHSV and specifies 'type 5', which is equivalent to serotype 5. The category is Organism. The exact serotype reference makes this the correct match for African horse sickness virus 5 (65398004), not the broader AHSV organism or other serotypes. No attributes of infection, timing, or host are introduced, so the organism code is appropriate."
223697002,Caribbean country (geographic location),Sovereign country in the Caribbean,"This wording identifies a national-level sovereign entity within the Caribbean region, which matches the 'Caribbean country (geographic location)' concept. The main concept is location; no additional attributes are included. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. Using 'country' with a Caribbean qualifier is more precise than the parent 'Country' alone, and avoids specificity required by child concepts. It is not equivalent to sibling concepts like 'Caribbean region' or 'Caribbean island', which denote different types of geographic entities."
385618000,Vaginal speculum (physical object),Supply item: vaginal speculum,"This refers to the supply item that is a vaginal speculum, fitting the Physical object (Device) category. SCTID 385618000 correctly captures the specific device. A parent concept for specula in general would be too broad, and child concepts with particular design or features are not described. The supply context does not add attributes affecting code choice; it remains the device itself."
846757003,No callus of foot (situation),No cutaneous callus of foot,"This phrasing uses “cutaneous” as a synonym for skin, stating no callus on the foot, which aligns with No callus of foot (situation), SCTID 846757003. The main concept is a negated finding regarding a cutaneous callus at the foot site, with no laterality or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. Mapping to a more general absence-of-callus concept or to presence-of-callus disorder is inappropriate; likewise, children or siblings adding sublocation or side would be overly specific. The term “cutaneous” is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
223596000,Indian subcontinent country (geographic location),Country of the Indian subcontinent (geographic location),"The entry expresses the same meaning using a slightly different structure, explicitly noting it is a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This matches SCTID 223596000 by specifying a country whose placement is in the Indian subcontinent. A parent concept like 'Geographic location' or 'Country' is too broad, and any specific child country would be narrower than stated. A sibling 'Indian subcontinent (region)' fails because the term focuses on a country, not the broader region."
223655008,Romania (geographic location),Roumania,"“Roumania” is an older variant spelling for the same country, semantically equivalent to Romania. It denotes the singular geographic entity and fits the Location → Geographic location category. The precise SNOMED concept is Romania (geographic location) [223655008]. Parent concepts are overly broad, and no specific sub-locations within Romania or other countries are mentioned, so child or sibling concepts would be less appropriate. The synonym does not introduce any new attributes."
284155008,Ability to move foot (observable entity),Patient-reported parameter: ability to move foot,"This indicates the observable being elicited from the patient, namely ability to move the foot, without stating a value. Category: Observable entity. The entry remains neutral and foot-specific, aligning with SCTID 284155008. It does not introduce laterality or outcome and should not be coded as a finding or as ROM/strength/coordination siblings, which represent different types of measures."
38304004,Lepisosteus platostomus (organism),Species: Lepisosteus platostomus,"The phrase explicitly labels the taxonomic rank as species and names Lepisosteus platostomus, focusing solely on the organism identity. No additional attributes (e.g., habitat, exposure, or condition) are stated. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Organism, with the specific species concept SCTID 38304004. Choosing a parent like Lepisosteus (genus) would reduce specificity, and selecting sibling species would be incorrect. The 'Species:' prefix is a contextual label that does not modify the concept; it confirms the species-level identification and supports the precise coding to Lepisosteus platostomus."
216387006,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, street (environment)",Place of incident recorded: street.,"The documentation captures the incident’s place of occurrence as street, an Environment or geographical location concept. This wording fits SNOMED CT 216387006, which codifies street specifically as the location of accident/poisoning. The generic term “incident” is an acceptable synonymic paraphrase of accident/poisoning occurrence and does not alter code selection. Parent concepts are too general, and child/sibling places (e.g., sidewalk, highway, home) are not indicated, ensuring a precise match."
699956003,Biceps brachii muscle and/or tendon structure (body structure),Area of interest: biceps brachii muscle-tendon complex,"This entry identifies the area of interest as the biceps brachii muscle-tendon complex, describing the combined musculotendinous anatomy. As a Body structure, it aligns with 699956003 (muscle and/or tendon). The term “complex” is a recognized synonym for the integrated muscle-tendon unit and does not add extraneous attributes. Narrower child concepts (muscle only, tendon only) are excluded by the combined phrasing."
454911000124104,Swab from face (specimen),Specimen type: facial swab,"This entry conveys that the specimen type is a swab and that it is from the facial region, with 'facial' synonymous to 'face.' It adds no other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 454911000124104 is the correct code, integrating both the method (swab) and site (face). More general or parent concepts fail to specify one of these attributes, and child or sibling concepts for other facial subsites or other anatomical locations would not match the text."
122576002,Genital mucus specimen (specimen),Sample type—genital mucus,"The entry declares the sample type as genital mucus, which is a SNOMED CT Specimen concept. Using “sample” is synonymous with “specimen” in clinical documentation and does not change the code selection. The material (mucus) and anatomical source (genital) are explicitly stated without extra attributes like subsite, sex, or collection method. A parent code for a generic mucus specimen would be underspecified, and children that specify a particular genital site (e.g., vaginal) would be over-specified. Thus, the most precise match is Genital mucus specimen (SCTID 122576002)."
73696005,Bone structure of phalanx of hand (body structure),"Phalanx of hand, bony structure","This entry denotes the bony (osseous) structure of a hand phalanx, exactly matching the concept 'Bone structure of phalanx of hand.' No laterality, digit, or segment is introduced, keeping it general within the single phalanx class. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. Parent concepts lacking the bone qualifier are less precise, and child concepts that specify proximal/middle/distal are not indicated here. The synonym 'bony structure' is equivalent to 'bone structure,' so SCTID 73696005 is appropriate."
48905009,Insect virus (organism),Insect virus,"The main concept explicitly named is an organism: an insect virus. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Organism and matches precisely SCTID 48905009 for “Insect virus (organism).” No attributes such as transmission, pathogenicity, or specificity to a subtype are introduced. More general parents like “Virus (organism)” are too broad, and children such as specific insect virus taxa (e.g., baculoviruses) would be overly specific. Sibling concepts like “Arbovirus” or “Insect-borne virus” describe viruses transmitted by insects to other hosts and do not necessarily infect insects as their host; thus they are not appropriate."
257046006,DPA1*0101 (substance),DPA1*0101 antigen,"This explicitly identifies the antigenic substance using the exact allele notation. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches DPA1*0101 (substance) precisely. Parent concepts lack allele specificity, and sibling alleles (e.g., DPA1*0104) would be incorrect."
719327002,Medication review done by community pharmacist (situation),Patient reports community pharmacist reviewed medications,"This patient-reported statement indicates a medication review has been done and that the performer was a community pharmacist. The concept remains a Situation with explicit context. The specific SNOMED CT match is 719327002, reflecting both the review and the performer. A generic 'medication review done' or 'by pharmacist' would be less specific, and other types of pharmacist (hospital/clinical) are not implied. The phrasing does not introduce outcome, timing, or other attributes."
704881004,Temperature point indicator (physical object),Temperature point indicator for single-threshold indication,This entry clarifies the design intent—indicating one temperature threshold—without adding extraneous attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It is semantically equivalent to “Temperature point indicator” and fits SCTID 704881004 precisely. It avoids mapping to a parent concept (lacking point specificity) and excludes siblings that suggest multiple thresholds or continuous measurement.
1335919003,Specimen from head obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Head region FNA biopsy specimen,"The entry denotes a specimen obtained by FNA biopsy from the head region, which is equivalent to 'head' within the intended anatomical context. Main concept: specimen; attributes: site = head; method = FNA biopsy. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This aligns with SCTID 1335919003 and avoids mapping to parent/sibling concepts that lack either site or method. No additional qualifiers (subsite, laterality, pathology) are introduced."
1228933006,American Joint Committee on Cancer cT2a2 (qualifier value),Staging (AJCC): cT2a2,"This denotes the AJCC staging qualifier cT2a2 within the clinical T category. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value, not a disorder code. It matches AJCC cT2a2 (1228933006) with explicit clinical prefix and subcategory a2. Parent or sibling levels (cT2, cT2a, cT2a1, pT2a2) are excluded by the exact wording. The phrasing is a neutral synonym that conveys the same qualifier without adding attributes."
51685009,"Roller skate, device (physical object)",Roller skate present in belongings,"The entry documents presence of the device among belongings; the central concept is the roller skate. Category: Physical object (Device). The wording does not imply a different device or a usage scenario that would shift coding. It is specific to roller skates, making Roller skate, device (51685009) the appropriate code over broader or sibling skate concepts."
40376000,Bowling (qualifier value),Bowling noted in chart,"This entry records the activity bowling in clinical documentation, matching the Qualifier value code 40376000. The chart context is purely administrative and does not alter the activity itself. Parent categories (sport/physical activity) are too broad, and child variants are not indicated. The entry remains uniquely codable to bowling without additional attributes."
71428001,Oil of copaiba (substance),Copaiba oil,"“Copaiba oil” is a common synonym for oil of copaiba and denotes the same single substance. The main concept is the substance itself; no additional attributes are present. The SNOMED category is Substance. Mapping to the exact concept Oil of copaiba (substance) [71428001] is appropriate, whereas mapping to parent categories like plant oils is too broad, and siblings such as copaiba balsam or copaiba resin would be incorrect due to the explicit reference to the oil rather than resin or balsam."
419244008,Ability to verbalize: medication characteristics (observable entity),Care plan item—ability to verbalize medication characteristics,"The item is framed within a care plan but retains the core concept: ability to verbalize medication characteristics, with no outcomes or qualifiers. This makes it an observable rather than a finding. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 419244008 is the correct code as it precisely matches the observable domain of medication characteristic verbalization. Broader or different-topic observables would not capture this specific content. The care plan context is administrative and does not introduce clinical attributes that would change the concept."
411903000,Betula verrucosa specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Betula verrucosa — diagnostic allergen extract product,"The entry explicitly connects Betula verrucosa with a diagnostic allergen extract product, indicating the species-specific diagnostic extract. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This is a direct match to SCTID 411903000. It remains more precise than generic parent concepts and does not imply sibling concepts like therapeutic extracts or multi-species mixes. No extra attributes such as formulation or route are stated."
224887004,Hospital waiting room (environment),Hospital waiting room noted,"This concise documentation notes the environment, specifically the hospital waiting room, without adding qualifiers. It falls under the Environment category and matches Hospital waiting room (environment) [224887004]. Broader or different locations (lobby, corridor, clinic waiting room) are excluded by the explicit hospital waiting room wording."
225743009,Seclusion room (environment),Chart location entry: seclusion room,"This notes a charted location of 'seclusion room,' which is a physical environmental setting. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The documentation context does not imply seclusion as a procedure and adds no new attributes to the room itself. Parent environment categories are too general, and sibling room types are not signaled. The phrasing is equivalent to naming the seclusion room, so SCTID 225743009 is the most precise code."
16534151000119105,Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of liver (procedure),Fusion SPECT/CT imaging of liver,This wording indicates fusion imaging using SPECT and CT focused on the liver. The main concept is a Procedure; “fusion” describes the coregistration typical of SPECT/CT but does not introduce extra attributes. It matches the SNOMED concept for SPECT with CT of liver by specifying both modalities and the organ. Parent SPECT/CT without organ or siblings limited to the liver with only one modality would be less appropriate. The term “fusion” is a clinically accepted synonym for hybrid SPECT/CT acquisition and remains semantically equivalent.
428706009,Plevitrexed (substance),Generic substance: plevitrexed,"Calling plevitrexed a generic substance describes the chemical identity and does not imply any brand, formulation, dose, or administration. The precise SNOMED CT concept is Plevitrexed (substance), SCTID 428706009. Parent pharmacologic class concepts or sibling product/administration codes would be less appropriate due to added attributes. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the substance."
3318003,Vaginal secretion (substance),"Vaginal secretion, body fluid","This is a descriptive rephrasing that classifies 'vaginal secretion' as a body fluid. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 3318003 is the correct code because the entry identifies the material itself. Choosing a clinical finding (e.g., 'Vaginal discharge') or a specimen code would be less accurate, as no clinical attributes or sampling details are asserted."
702706001,Diabetes clinic (environment),Place of care: diabetes clinic,"The entry identifies the place of care as 'diabetes clinic', expressing only the environment. It maps to Diabetes clinic (environment), SCTID 702706001 (Environment category). No additional attributes such as outpatient status, age group, or subspecialty are added. Parent environments are too general, and sibling clinics (e.g., endocrine clinic) are broader than the stated diabetes focus. There is no indication of a child subspecialty clinic. Therefore, the diabetes clinic environment code is the most precise selection."
280679001,Structure of conjunctival fold (body structure),Conjunctival fold—eye anatomy,"This entry clarifies that the conjunctival fold belongs to eye anatomy, which is inherent to the conjunctiva, and does not introduce new modifiers. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The correct code is Structure of conjunctival fold (280679001). More general ocular or conjunctival structures would be less precise, and specific named folds or regions are not indicated, making narrower child concepts inappropriate."
269792006,Accident asphyxia by plastic bag (event),Event documented: accidental plastic bag-associated asphyxia,"The entry frames this as an event and clearly identifies accidental asphyxia associated with a plastic bag. The main concept is an unintentional asphyxia event with a plastic bag as the mechanism. SNOMED CT category: Event. This maps directly to Accident asphyxia by plastic bag (event). More general parents (accidental asphyxia) lack the causal specificity, while siblings with other items causing asphyxia are incorrect. The phrase 'associated' here signals cause mechanism without adding extra attributes."
67036009,Plant growth regulator (substance),Plant growth-regulating substance,"The text denotes a substance that regulates plant growth, clearly matching SNOMED CT’s Substance category and precisely the concept Plant growth regulator (67036009). The hyphenated phrasing is a direct synonym and does not introduce new attributes such as indication, route, or specific identity. Broader categories like pesticide or agricultural chemical would be less precise, and sibling terms like plant hormone would be narrower or differently modeled; the entry stays at the correct generic regulator level."
50362007,Stellate (qualifier value),Stellate morphology,"This phrasing expresses the shape characteristic as morphology: 'stellate.' The concept category is Qualifier value. SCTID 50362007 is the exact match, as the entry specifies a star-shaped morphological descriptor only. Parent terms for morphology/shape would be too broad, while sibling qualifiers (e.g., 'round,' 'spiculated') are not indicated. There is no added attribute like site, size, or etiology."
48817005,Irrigation of gastrostomy (procedure),Tube care: gastrostomy irrigated.,"Within a care context, the specific action is irrigation of the gastrostomy. No details beyond the procedure itself are provided. Category: Procedure. The precise match is SNOMED CT 48817005 Irrigation of gastrostomy (procedure). General care or irrigation codes would be overly broad, and sibling procedures focused on non-gastrostomy tubes do not fit the wording."
792910006,Quick service food (substance),Fast-food offerings,"‘Offerings’ refers to the food items offered in the fast-food context, equivalent to quick service food. No consumption, amount, or timing is implied. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It maps to 792910006 Quick service food (substance). Broader Food (substance) or different categories such as snack food or street food are not more precise given the wording."
119357000,Basophil specimen (specimen),"Basophil cells, specimen","This phrasing identifies basophil cells as the material of the specimen, making it a clear specimen concept. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the exact match is 119357000 (Basophil specimen). The wording does not imply test results, diagnoses, or processing methods; it solely names the specimen type. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., neutrophil specimen) would be mismatched because basophils are specified."
223657000,Ukraine (geographic location),Ukraine [location],"The bracketed descriptor '[location]' makes explicit that the concept is a geographic location, namely Ukraine. This belongs to the Geographic location (Location) category and corresponds precisely to Ukraine (geographic location) 223657000. Parent and sibling concepts would be less precise or incorrect, and children (e.g., Kyiv) are not mentioned. No attributes like timing, laterality, or relationships are introduced; it remains a standalone location term."
224885007,Hospital consulting room (environment),Provider workspace: hospital consulting room,"This describes the provider’s workspace as a consulting room located in the hospital, emphasizing the physical environment. It fits the Environment or geographical location category in SNOMED CT and maps to 'Hospital consulting room (environment)' 224885007. The hospital qualifier rules out broader or non-hospital sibling locations; no attributes suggest a specialized department room."
309203003,Liver biopsy specimen (specimen),Liver tissue biopsy specimen,"By stating 'liver tissue' and 'biopsy specimen', the entry specifies that the specimen consists of hepatic tissue obtained by biopsy, aligning with the Specimen concept SCTID 309203003. It avoids extra attributes such as approach or number of cores, which would imply children. It is more specific than 'Liver tissue specimen' (which might be excision or autopsy) because it explicitly denotes biopsy acquisition."
215965001,"Forced landing while taking off, occupant of military aircraft injured (event)",Event type: injured military aircraft occupant due to forced landing during takeoff,"This text identifies the event as an injured occupant of a military aircraft resulting from a forced landing during takeoff. The concept type is Event. It maps to SCTID 215965001 by capturing forced landing, takeoff phase, military aircraft, and injury to an occupant. Parent concepts would be too general, and siblings or children specifying other aircraft types or phases would misrepresent the scenario. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent."
257598001,Dock - marine (environment),Maritime dock,"“Maritime” is a synonym for marine and here modifies “dock,” establishing the same environmental concept. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This aligns with Dock - marine (environment) and avoids broader or different locations. No cause, time, or clinical modifiers are implied—just the marine dock place."
166934000,Theophylline level therapeutic (finding),Medication monitoring note: theophylline level therapeutic,"This entry documents in a medication-monitoring context that the theophylline level is therapeutic, a Clinical finding. It maps precisely to 'Theophylline level therapeutic (finding)' SCTID 166934000. The context words do not add attributes such as values or severity. Sibling concepts for abnormal levels and parent concepts lacking therapeutic qualification are less appropriate than this specific therapeutic-level finding."
386532001,Invasive arterial pressure (observable entity),Direct arterial blood pressure,"The term 'direct' in hemodynamic monitoring conventionally denotes invasive measurement. Thus, 'direct arterial blood pressure' represents the invasive arterial pressure observable entity. SCTID 386532001 is the precise code since the entry focuses on the parameter (arterial pressure) with invasive method, not on procedural monitoring. It excludes non-invasive methods and does not introduce subcomponents (systolic/diastolic/mean), so siblings or child observables would be less appropriate."
275576008,Elderly assessment clinic (environment),Care setting—elderly assessment clinic,"This entry specifies the care setting and names it as an elderly assessment clinic, clearly denoting an environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It maps to Elderly assessment clinic (environment), SCTID 275576008, rather than a parent like general clinic or a sibling such as geriatric clinic without 'assessment.' The em dash and labeling do not change the underlying concept."
1286999008,Entire S1 spinal ganglion (body structure),Complete S1 DRG,"The abbreviation DRG stands for dorsal root ganglion, and “Complete” indicates the entire structure at S1. This represents a Body structure. The phrase maps exactly to Entire S1 spinal ganglion (1286999008) because it asserts the full ganglion at the S1 level without laterality or additional attributes. Parent concepts (e.g., DRG without level) are too general, and sibling concepts like “Structure of S1 DRG” lack the ‘entire’ qualifier. Child concepts describing parts of the S1 DRG would not match the notion of completeness."
242465009,Accident caused by fire in road tunnel (event),Accident due to fire in a road tunnel,"This phrasing maintains the same three core attributes: an accident event, causation by fire, and the setting in a road tunnel. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and SCTID 242465009 precisely encodes this combined scenario. Using 'due to' as a synonym for causation does not change semantics. More general parents or siblings (e.g., 'Fire in tunnel' or 'Road traffic accident') would be less specific or add unintended context not present in the text."
763323007,Hormone replacement therapy declined (situation),Hormone replacement regimen declined,"Referring to the HRT as a “regimen” still denotes the same therapy and a patient refusal of it. This is a Situation with explicit context and maps to SNOMED CT 763323007 Hormone replacement therapy declined. Broader regimen refusal concepts or non-replacement hormone therapy refusals are less precise, and agent-specific regimen refusals would introduce details not present. The synonym “regimen” does not alter the coding choice for HRT declined."
439587001,Harvesting of small intestine from cadaver donor (procedure),Small bowel organ harvest—cadaver donor,"The text denotes an organ harvest of the small bowel from a cadaver donor, providing both organ and donor type. It is a Procedure and maps directly to 439587001. Parent concepts like unspecified cadaveric organ harvest lack the organ detail, while siblings like large bowel harvest or living donor harvest are incorrect. 'Small bowel' and 'small intestine' are interchangeable clinical terms here."
95866005,"Exposure to extreme temperature, non-occupational (event)",Exposure to extreme environmental temperature outside of work,"The phrase documents an exposure event to extreme environmental temperature explicitly occurring outside of work, which is equivalent to non-occupational. This is an Event concept and does not add new attributes beyond the required occupational qualifier. It avoids specifying heat or cold and does not mention injury or timing, so child disorder concepts or specific exposure subtypes are not appropriate. The occupational status makes the unqualified parent and the occupational sibling less precise."
257565006,Apartment in apartment building (environment),Patient’s housing: apartment unit in an apartment building.,"The main concept is an apartment unit situated in an apartment building; 'unit' is a synonymous descriptor for the individual apartment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This matches Apartment in apartment building (environment) 257565006. Alternatives such as Condominium apartment or Studio apartment introduce specific tenure or layout attributes not present here, and the general Apartment building concept would be less precise than the unit-level environment specified."
116776001,D-alpha-tocopherol (substance),D-alpha-tocopherol,"The entry explicitly names D-alpha-tocopherol, the natural stereoisomer of alpha-tocopherol. The main medical concept is a specific chemical substance, and no additional attributes (dose, route, timing, formulation) are introduced. In SNOMED CT this belongs to the Substance category. The most precise match is SCTID 116776001 (D-alpha-tocopherol), rather than broader parent concepts like vitamin E or alpha-tocopherol in general, and it avoids siblings such as dl-alpha-tocopherol or esterified forms (e.g., d-alpha-tocopherol acetate)."
25151000087102,Antigen of Bordetella pertussis fimbriae 3 (substance),Antigen target—Bordetella pertussis Fim3,The context label 'Antigen target—' indicates usage in an assay but the named entity is the Fim3 antigen of B. pertussis. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This entry still denotes the substance itself and is more precise than generic 'pertussis antigen.' It excludes other pertussis components and does not convert the concept into an observable or procedure; the underlying coded entity remains the antigen substance.
415143003,Postanesthesia care unit Phase 2 (environment),Phase II postanesthesia care setting,"This entry expresses the setting/environment as Phase II postanesthesia care, i.e., PACU Phase II. The main concept is the environment; no added attributes such as procedures or patient status are included. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It maps to SCTID 415143003 by explicitly indicating Phase II within postanesthesia care. The parent 'postanesthesia care unit' without a phase would be too general, and the sibling 'Phase I' is not appropriate. 'Setting' is an accepted synonym indicating environment without changing code selection."
389249005,Genus Dobsonia (organism),Cataloged organism taxon: Dobsonia (genus),"The statement catalogs an organism taxon and designates Dobsonia as a genus, which aligns exactly with SNOMED CT concept 389249005. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It does not introduce species-level specificity or broader groupings. The phrasing is context only and does not alter the taxonomic interpretation."
774308007,Product containing microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor (product),Medication: microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor,"This documentation-style entry lists a medication characterized only by containing a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, without specifying strength, route, brand, or formulation. The main concept is a medicinal product, placing it in the SNOMED CT Product hierarchy. The term “medication” here denotes a product and not a therapeutic procedure, so the product concept is preferred over any administration or therapy code. A parent concept like a general medication product would be less precise, and a child concept such as a specific MTP inhibitor product or form would add unmentioned details. The terminology used is a direct synonym for the concept and remains codable to the product level."
123981000119109,Long-term current use of isotretinoin (situation),Pharmacy note: long-term current isotretinoin use confirmed,"This pharmacy documentation confirms the patient is currently using isotretinoin in a long-term manner, matching Long-term current use of isotretinoin (SCTID 123981000119109). The principal concepts are isotretinoin and the long-term current-use status. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It is more exact than parent concepts and avoids siblings that do not include the long-term attribute. The entry does not add indication, dose, or monitoring details."
162056003,No nausea (situation),Nausea absent.,"The entry states directly that nausea is absent, which is a negated finding. It should be coded to the SNOMED Situation with explicit context: “No nausea (situation)” (162056003). The parent finding “Nausea” indicates presence and is therefore unsuitable, and concepts with additional qualifiers (such as severity or timing) are not warranted. “Absent” is a clinically precise synonym for known absent context."
411576001,Chicken serum proteins diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy workup utilized chicken serum proteins diagnostic extract,"This note indicates that an allergy workup used a diagnostic extract composed of chicken serum proteins, mapping to 411576001. The core concept is a diagnostic allergen extract product (Product). The usage context does not introduce outcome or modality attributes. It is more specific than generic diagnostic extracts due to the named allergen source and avoids child concepts by omitting method or formulation details. It cannot be confused with sibling chicken allergen products because it explicitly states serum proteins."
289174003,Hyperesthesia of special senses (finding),Special senses oversensitivity noted,"This documentation-style entry records oversensitivity (hyperesthesia) in the special senses, fitting SNOMED CT 289174003 (Clinical finding). The phrasing does not introduce timing beyond the fact of a finding, nor does it identify any particular sense modality. Parent codes for general hyperesthesia include non-special sensory domains, and child/sibling concepts like photophobia or hyperacusis are too specific and not stated, making this concept the correct target."
257600007,Dock premises (environment),Location: dock premises,"The concept indicated is an environmental location, specifically 'dock premises.' The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The context label 'Location:' does not change the underlying concept; it simply frames it in documentation. The precise match is Dock premises (257600007). Broader locations or different maritime environments would be less appropriate. No cause, timing, or other attributes are added."
223779003,South Australia (geographic location),South Australia (state-level geographic location),"The phrase specifies the granularity—state-level—confirming the entry denotes South Australia as a geographic location entity. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. This is a precise match to SCTID 223779003 and does not imply any relationship (e.g., residence), avoiding parent, child, or sibling mappings. The qualifier is descriptive and preserves codability to the state."
214326002,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision, on highway, between motor vehicle and safety island, passenger on motor cycle injured (event)",Indication: highway crash—motorcycle collided with safety island; passenger injured.,"This imaging indication refers to a highway crash involving a motorcycle colliding with a safety island, with injury to the passenger. The category is Event. SCTID 214326002 is most accurate as it captures collision, highway, safety island, and motorcycle passenger injury. Parent/sibling concepts with different objects or roles, or lacking collision specification, would not reflect the documented mechanism."
31349005,Aspergillus oryzae aspartic proteinase (substance),Labeled as 'Aspergillus oryzae aspartic proteinase',"The phrase indicates how the substance is labeled but the core concept remains the enzyme Substance named: Aspergillus oryzae aspartic proteinase. This maps to SNOMED CT code 31349005. Parent or sibling concepts lacking the aspartic class or organism specificity would not be as precise. No additional clinical attributes (e.g., hypersensitivity, dosing, purpose) are implied."
358246001,Acetate hemodialysis liquid concentrate (product),Dialysis center log: acetate hemodialysis liquid concentrate,"A log entry names the product acetate hemodialysis liquid concentrate. Concepts: acetate, hemodialysis, liquid concentrate; context is administrative. Category: Product. It maps to SCTID 358246001 precisely. Parent concepts like generic hemodialysis dialysate or non-concentrated fluids are too broad, and siblings such as bicarbonate concentrates or powder forms would be incorrect. The logging context does not change the product identity or introduce additional attributes."
1099381000119109,History of benign neoplasm of bone (situation),Documented history of benign bone neoplasm,"The documentation reflects a past personal history of a benign neoplasm in bone. The attributes include benign, bone, and the situational context of history. This is a SNOMED Situation with explicit context, best coded as History of benign neoplasm of bone (SCTID 1099381000119109). It does not represent an active disorder and does not imply malignancy or family history. The terminology 'bone neoplasm' is equivalent to 'bone tumor' in clinical usage, maintaining the same code."
223845007,Balearic islands (geographic location),Exposure location: Balearic Islands,"The entry denotes the exposure location, identifying the Balearic Islands as the place. This is a Geographic location (Location). It maps to SCTID 223845007, as the referenced entity is the archipelago itself without mention of child islands or administrative types. Parent concepts like Spain are broader, and sibling island groups are different entities. The context of exposure does not alter the geographic concept being coded."
705605004,Laminar airflow unit (physical object),Noted: laminar airflow unit,"A note-style entry mentioning 'laminar airflow unit' still centers on the physical object itself. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The text avoids additional attributes that would necessitate a different code, so the general laminar airflow unit SCTID 705605004 is most suitable. Broader parent concepts would lose specificity, and narrower children/siblings like specific cabinets or benches are not implied. The contextual verb does not alter the coded concept."
224649005,House converted from barn or mill (environment),Living situation: barn-or-mill conversion house.,"The living situation is documented as a house that is a barn-or-mill conversion. The main concept is the home environment classification. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and fits SCTID 224649005. Parent terms like House do not include the conversion detail, and other housing types or building conversions are not referenced, keeping the code selection specific."
64702000,"Tear production, function (observable entity)",Eye tear production function,"Adding ‘eye’ clarifies the physiologic context but does not introduce laterality or additional attributes; it remains the functional observable of tear production. It is categorized as an Observable entity and does not imply disorder, rate, subtype, or test results. It is distinct from sibling observables like tear film osmolarity or rate, and from procedures like Schirmer testing. The wording maps best to Tear production, function (observable entity), SCTID 64702000."
1217305002,Eosine disodium (substance),Patient mentions eosine disodium by name,"This patient-context statement still centers on the named chemical substance without adding attributes like allergy, exposure, or dosage. It should be coded to the Substance concept Eosine disodium. Parent concepts would be too general (eosin/eosine without salt), and sibling concepts for other salts or derivatives are excluded by the explicit “disodium” wording."
426230004,Product containing renin inhibitor (product),Direct renin inhibitor (product),"This identifies the product class of direct renin inhibitors, which is the standard mechanism for renin inhibitors. The category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The adjective 'direct' is clinically synonymous with renin inhibitor products and does not introduce additional attributes or specificity beyond the class, so SCTID 426230004 is appropriate. It is not a broader RAAS inhibitor product, nor a specific aliskiren product (child)."
414328004,Genus Kocuria (organism),Kocuria species not otherwise specified (NOS),"The phrase ‘species NOS’ denotes an unspecified species within the Kocuria genus, effectively coding at the genus level without identifying a species. Main concept: Kocuria genus. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The most accurate code is Genus Kocuria (organism) SCTID 414328004. A species-level code would be too specific, and parent categories too general. No clinical findings or disease statements are included."
364846000,Finding related to ability to stop running (finding),Documented finding on stop-running ability,"This entry indicates a recorded clinical finding about the ability to stop running, remaining neutral regarding the value. The appropriate SNOMED CT code is 364846000 (Clinical finding). It does not introduce outcome details or related conditions, so more specific child concepts remain inappropriate. Parent or sibling concepts are excluded because the focus is specifically the stop-running ability."
701006005,"Craniofacial bone tack, bioabsorbable (physical object)",Equipment list includes bioabsorbable craniofacial bone tack,"The equipment list reference still denotes a specific device: a bioabsorbable craniofacial bone tack. SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This aligns with SCTID 701006005. Broader references to fixation equipment would be too general, and sibling devices (e.g., screws, plates, metallic tacks) are different physical objects. The context of inclusion in a list does not introduce any additional attributes beyond the device identity."
702907000,Pediatric rheumatology clinic (environment),Paediatric rheumatology clinic,"This is the British English spelling of the same environment—a clinic focused on pediatric rheumatology. No timing, severity, or encounter attributes are introduced; it is strictly the location/setting. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The concept aligns exactly with 702907000. Using 'paediatric' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'pediatric' and does not change code selection. Parent terms lacking either 'pediatric' or 'rheumatology' would be too general, and department/service siblings differ in organizational type rather than clinic environment."
444118005,Recommendation of Rh>o<(D) immune globulin dose (procedure),Pharmacy note: Rh(D) immune globulin dose recommendation,"A pharmacy documentation context is provided, but the core concept remains a dose recommendation for Rh(D) immune globulin, aligning exactly with Procedure 444118005. The entry does not reflect administration, dispensing, or ordering; it is advisory in nature. Parent concepts for general dosing recommendations lack the specificity to Rh(D) immune globulin, and siblings like “Drug administration” would be inaccurate. The terminology used is standard and does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
164963004,Susceptibility skin test done (situation),Skin susceptibility test performed,"The entry states the performance of a skin test to assess susceptibility, aligning with the 'done' context. It is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 164963004 is the correct code because it specifically captures a susceptibility skin test done; using the procedure concept would fail to communicate the contextual status, and specifying not done or a different type of skin test would miscode the statement."
267000009,History of biliary disease (situation),Chart lists history of biliary disease,"This sentence states that the medical chart includes a history of biliary disease, confirming prior occurrence. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The precise code is History of biliary disease (267000009). A parent like History of gastrointestinal disease would be too broad, and child histories of specific biliary conditions would be too narrow and not stated. The phrasing preserves the historical qualifier and does not introduce severity, cause, or timing beyond the inherent past context."
301570003,Able to mobilize using mobility aids (finding),Discharge functional capacity: mobilizes with mobility aids,"This entry defines the discharge functional capacity as mobilizing with mobility aids, without additional specifics. It is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 301570003 is the appropriate code because it encodes ability supported by mobility aids. A broader parent would omit the aid dependence, and more specific children (e.g., device-specific) are not substantiated. The summary context is merely documentation and does not change the semantic equivalence."
104588007,Chondroitin sulfate measurement (procedure),Patient reports a chondroitin sulfate test was done,"A patient-reported statement confirming that the test (i.e., measurement) for chondroitin sulfate occurred still denotes the performance of the procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. ‘Test’ here is synonymous with measurement/assay for a specific analyte and does not introduce screening intent or results. It maps to 104588007 and avoids observable entity or request semantics and child-level specifics."
360510006,Structure of muscle belly of occipitofrontalis (body structure),Occipitofrontalis muscle belly structure,"This explicitly calls the structure the muscle belly of the occipitofrontalis. It is purely anatomical, fitting the Body structure category. The phrasing matches SCTID 360510006 because it identifies the belly within the named muscle without naming frontal or occipital sub-bellies. The whole-muscle parent is less precise, and sibling structures are not referenced. The wording is a semantically equivalent paraphrase."
258833003,Milligram/minute (qualifier value),mg per minute,"This entry states the unit as 'mg per minute,' expressing the same mass/time rate. As a unit of measure, it is a Qualifier value and should be coded as Milligram/minute (SCTID 258833003). It avoids introducing quantity or clinical conditions, making more general parents inappropriate and unit siblings (e.g., mg/hour) incorrect. The phrase is a direct synonym of milligram/minute and does not change code selection."
315267003,Malignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri suspected (situation),Impression: endometrial cancer suspected,"This entry records an impression of suspected cancer in the endometrium of the uterine corpus and does not assert confirmation or add other attributes. It fits the SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context due to diagnostic uncertainty. SCTID 315267003 precisely represents suspected malignant neoplasm of the endometrium of the corpus uteri. A disorder concept for confirmed endometrial cancer would be incorrect. Broader uterine malignancy suspicion lacks endometrial specificity. “Cancer” and “malignant neoplasm” are equivalent clinical synonyms, so the choice of wording does not change the concept."
118543006,Mass increment (property) (qualifier value),Delta mass (property),"This entry uses the common term “delta mass” to denote change in mass as a property, matching the SNOMED Qualifier value for mass increment. It clearly references the property dimension rather than any clinical finding. A general property parent is too broad, and siblings without the increment semantics are inappropriate. The synonym is widely accepted and does not add any attributes or imply positivity."
257002003,B*4005 (substance),Antigen B*40:05 (HLA-B),"The entry expresses the same antigen substance using word order and a parenthetical locus, equivalent to HLA-B*40:05. No detection status or patient context is asserted. The category is Substance. SCTID 257002003 fits precisely; mapping to parent HLA-B or B*40 group antigens would lose specificity, and sibling alleles are excluded by the explicit *40:05 identifier."
371397000,Syphilis suspected on epidemiological grounds (situation),Note: syphilis suspected on public health grounds,"“Public health grounds” here convey an epidemiologic basis for suspicion, aligning with “Syphilis suspected on epidemiological grounds” (371397000). Category: Situation. The entry does not assert clinical signs or lab evidence, so siblings for clinical or lab grounds are not appropriate. Exposure-only or screening procedure codes would miss the suspicion element, and confirmed syphilis would be incorrect, making 371397000 the correct, specific code."
223667005,Iceland (geographic location),Iceland — country referenced,"This phrasing indicates that the referenced entity is the country Iceland, a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). It corresponds directly to SCTID 223667005. The wording does not introduce new attributes like event location or exposure—only the place is stated. Parents are too broad; no child/sibling is implied."
1098951000119108,History of cancer metastatic to liver (situation),Problem list: history—cancer metastasis to liver,"The problem list entry explicitly labels 'history' and describes cancer metastasis to the liver, clearly situating it as a historical situation. The main concept is historical hepatic metastasis. This is a Situation concept corresponding to code 1098951000119108. Parent concepts lacking metastatic site are imprecise, while disorder codes for secondary liver cancer imply active disease. The phrasing is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and does not introduce additional attributes such as primary site or extent."
1340255000,Structure of ciliary gland of upper eyelid (body structure),Ciliary gland of the upper palpebra,"‘Palpebra’ is a clinically accepted synonym for eyelid. The entry describes the ciliary gland situated in the upper palpebra, representing an anatomical structure and fitting the Body structure category. It matches SCTID 1340255000 precisely and is more specific than general eyelid ciliary gland concepts; it does not invoke subtypes or laterality, avoiding child or sibling codes."
116596006,Product containing glucocorticoid (product),Glucocorticoid-based medication,"The phrase indicates a medication whose pharmacologic basis is a glucocorticoid, without specifying agent or route. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. SCTID 116596006 is appropriate, covering any product containing a glucocorticoid. Using a parent like corticosteroid-based medication would be broader and less precise, while children naming specific glucocorticoids or dosage forms would be narrower than stated. 'Based' is a colloquial synonym implying the active class and does not introduce extra attributes."
66187002,Fatty stool (finding),Fat in stool (greasy/oily appearance),"This phrase indicates fat present in the stool with clarifying descriptors of greasy/oily appearance, maintaining a clinical description rather than a lab measurement. It is a Clinical finding that maps to Fatty stool (finding), SCTID 66187002. It avoids test terms (e.g., Sudan stain) and other stool attributes, so increased fecal fat or other siblings would not be as precise."
785329004,Product containing oxygen and/or oxygen compound (product),Oxygen and/or oxygen-compound containing product,"This entry denotes a product whose contents include oxygen or an oxygen compound, consistent with the FSN. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The use of “and/or” prevents narrowing to a child concept that only includes oxygen or only oxygen compounds, thereby mapping exactly to SCTID 785329004. It excludes sibling product groups containing other elements and does not add attributes such as medicinal intent or dosage, which would shift it to a different product concept. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and retains the same codable meaning."
364162008,Measure of liver (observable entity),Radiology header: liver measurement,"The entry denotes a radiology report header specifying a measurement observable for the liver, without detailing modality or property. Category: Observable entity. It matches 'Measure of liver' (364162008), as it is an observable name, not a finding or procedure. More granular children like 'liver length' or 'liver volume' are not indicated, and broader entities are less specific than the liver-focused measure."
49336000,Entire collateral ligament of interphalangeal joint of hand (body structure),Diagram label: entire collateral ligament of the hand interphalangeal joint,"As a labeling context, this still identifies the whole collateral ligament at an interphalangeal joint of the hand, which is a Body structure. The use of 'entire' ensures alignment to 'Entire collateral ligament of interphalangeal joint of hand' (49336000). A broader parent without 'entire' would be less accurate, and narrower concepts (radial/ulnar collateral, specific digit/IP subtype) are not implied by the wording."
4540002,Adenosine diphosphate deaminase (substance),Catalog entry — ADP deaminase,A catalog reference to ADP deaminase still denotes the specific substance without implying any action beyond naming. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The entry correctly corresponds to SCTID 4540002 and does not introduce procedural or diagnostic attributes. Parent and sibling concepts fail to capture the exact substrate specificity indicated by ADP deaminase.
414973002,Organic gluten-free bread mix (product),Organic gluten-free mix for bread,The phrase 'mix for bread' is a standard paraphrase of 'bread mix' and retains the organic and gluten-free qualifiers. The main concept is a Product. This matches SCTID 414973002 because it denotes the exact product type and attributes. More general parent concepts or siblings that do not include both organic and gluten-free would be less specific. No extra attributes like flavor or additives are introduced.
161775000,History of sheath usage (situation),Reports having used a sheath during sexual activity,"The patient reports prior use of a sheath (condom) during sexual activity, which expresses a history without frequency or timing specifics. The concept is history of condom use and falls under Situation with explicit context. SNOMED 161775000 is appropriate, as “sheath” equals “condom” in clinical terminology. Parent or sibling codes introducing broader or current behaviors would be less precise."
447616003,Procnias averano (organism),"Bearded bellbird, Procnias averano","Listing the common name followed by the scientific name unambiguously identifies the species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 447616003 is the correct code for this species, in contrast to broader parents or different sibling species. The synonym pairing remains a naming variation without adding clinical or situational attributes."
130230003,Anthranilate N-methyltransferase (substance),Anthranilate N-methyltransferase catalytic enzyme,"Describing it as a catalytic enzyme is accurate and does not alter the substance identity; category is Substance. The entry still denotes anthranilate N-methyltransferase, aligning with SCTID 130230003. Parent categories like 'catalytic enzyme (substance)' are too broad, and sibling entities with different substrate specificity or methylation position are inappropriate. The phrasing avoids attributes such as concentration, function status, or organism, keeping the mapping confined to the enzyme substance."
462592005,"Positron emission tomography system table, non-powered (physical object)",PET patient positioning table — non-powered,"This entry specifies the table used to position patients for PET, and the em dash emphasizes the non-powered attribute. The main concept is the PET system table as a physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It is a precise match to SCTID 462592005 because it identifies PET modality and explicitly non-powered status. A generic PET table (parent) lacks the power qualifier; powered tables (sibling) would not fit. The synonym “patient positioning table” is equivalent to “system table” in this context."
242881007,Assault by stabbing with pocket knife (event),"Assault, stabbing with pocket knife","Comma-separated phrasing still identifies the event: an assault characterized by stabbing with a pocket knife. This corresponds to the Event concept “Assault by stabbing with pocket knife (event).” General assault or knife assault without the pocket knife specificity would be less accurate, and disorder codes should be avoided because the entry describes the external cause."
263676004,Antero/retrograde (qualifier value),Approach direction: antero/retrograde,"The context 'Approach direction' indicates the attribute being set, while the actual qualifier value is antero/retrograde. This is a SNOMED CT Qualifier value that aligns exactly with Antero/retrograde (qualifier value) [263676004]. No procedural details are given, avoiding any mapping to a procedure concept; only the qualifier value is specified. Choosing Anterograde or Retrograde alone would exclude part of the intended meaning, and selecting a generic direction qualifier would be less specific. This is distinct from Bidirectional and uses the explicit SNOMED designation."
223501002,Australasia (geographic location),Destination: Australasia,"The entry lists 'Australasia' as a destination, which remains the geographic location concept. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). The named region corresponds to SCTID 223501002. No broader (Oceania) or alternate regions are implied. The context term 'Destination' adds no clinical attributes beyond identifying the location."
1162801006,Immunoreactive trypsinogen within reference range (finding),The immunoreactive trypsinogen measurement falls within reference range,"This narrative states the measurement for immunoreactive trypsinogen is within the reference range, directly aligning with the concept. It is a Clinical finding and should be coded to 1162801006. More general parent concepts omit the normal-range qualifier, and abnormal child/sibling concepts are inconsistent with the phrasing. The wording is semantically equivalent and precise."
298599001,Lumbar spine - range of movement (observable entity),Lumbar spine ROM assessment,"The entry identifies the observable subject—range of motion of the lumbar spine—being assessed. It remains within the Observable entity category and does not introduce outcome descriptors or motion subtypes. Therefore, SNOMED CT 298599001 is the most precise match, whereas a generic spinal ROM or directional ROM would be mismatched parent or child concepts."
279728003,Structure of vestibular recess (body structure),Region: vestibular recess,"Referring to the vestibular recess as a region anchors the entry to the anatomical structure. Category: Body structure. It does not specify location within a particular organ system, nor does it describe any condition or laterality. Thus, the best match is 'Structure of vestibular recess' (279728003), not broader regions or specific child structures."
833289001,Tenderness of anatomical snuffbox (finding),Clinical finding: anatomic snuffbox tenderness,"This explicitly labels an exam finding of tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox, categorized as a Clinical finding. The most precise SNOMED CT code is 833289001. Parent concepts would be overly broad, and siblings specifying different symptoms or nearby bones (e.g., scaphoid) would be incorrect. 'Anatomic' is a common variant spelling and is semantically equivalent to 'anatomical' without adding attributes."
1148640004,Measured quantity of intake of vitamin B6 and/or vitamin B6 derivative in 24 hours (observable entity),Diet diary result—measured quantity of vitamin B6 and derivatives in 24 hours,"The entry indicates that from a diet diary, a measured quantity for intake of vitamin B6 and its derivatives was determined over a 24-hour period. The observable’s attributes are intake, measured quantity, analyte (vitamin B6 and derivatives), and the 24-hour duration. This is an Observable entity and maps directly to SCTID 1148640004. It does not suggest estimation, serum levels, or excretion, which would be sibling concepts, and it includes both vitamin B6 and derivatives, not just one, avoiding child concepts. The diary context does not change the measurement concept; it only indicates data source."
445004,Repair of malunion of tibia (procedure),Operative care: correction of tibial malunion,"This entry describes operative care involving correction of a tibial malunion, which equates to repair of malunion of tibia. The concept is a Procedure. SCTID 445004 is the exact match for this procedure because it specifies both the tibia and the malunion indication. Parent concepts without the tibial site are insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts representing nonunion repair or different bones are incorrect. The wording uses a synonymous phrasing (“correction”) without adding technical method details."
410534003,Not indicated (qualifier value),Not indicated,"The phrase explicitly conveys the qualifier value “not indicated,” which denotes that there is no clinical indication for an action or intervention. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The most precise code is 410534003 Not indicated (qualifier value), because this is a general, context-free qualifier used to modify another element (e.g., a potential test or treatment) without adding attributes like timing or severity. Parent or sibling concepts such as Indicated (qualifier value) or Contraindicated (qualifier value) are less appropriate because the statement does not express positive indication or risk/harm; it simply indicates absence of indication. No disorder or finding concepts are implicated."
701569005,Urinary catheter/drainage bag connection facilitator (physical object),Urine bag interface for urinary catheter,"This entry identifies the interface component that connects a urinary catheter to a urine bag, which corresponds to 'Urinary catheter/drainage bag connection facilitator' (701569005). It belongs to the Physical object (device) category. 'Interface' here is used as a synonym for connector/adapter and does not introduce additional functions or attributes. A parent concept like 'interface device' is too broad since it does not specify the urinary catheter-to-bag link, and siblings such as 'urine bag' or 'catheter securement device' denote different objects. Thus, this code is the most exact match."
218102004,Accident caused by blasting cap (event),ED triage note: accident caused by blasting cap,"This entry documents, within an emergency department triage context, an accident with causation by a blasting cap. The concept is an Event and maps precisely to SCTID 218102004. The contextual prefix (ED triage note) does not alter the coded concept, and the specified cause prevents mapping to more general external cause categories or different explosive-device siblings."
130667003,Gingipain R (substance),Arginine-specific cysteine endopeptidase (gingipain R),"This synonym emphasizes the enzyme class (endopeptidase) and arginine specificity, tied to 'gingipain R' for clarity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It precisely targets Gingipain R (130667003), not the generic gingipain or the lysine-specific Kgp sibling, and does not introduce measurement or procedural attributes."
300899005,Complement component C4 (substance),Analyte name: complement component C4,"Naming the analyte as complement component C4 references the substance being measured without specifying a measurement or result, keeping the focus on the substance concept SNOMED CT 300899005. No level, abnormality, specimen, or fragment detail is provided, so mapping to an observable or result is avoided. More generic parents are less precise, and fragment/sibling concepts like C4a/C4b or C3 are not indicated. The term is clinically equivalent to the preferred substance name."
1256104003,Occupied (qualifier value),Availability: occupied,"This sets an availability field to “occupied,” directly matching Occupied (SCTID 1256104003) in the Qualifier value hierarchy. The category is Qualifier value. The header “Availability” is context for the data element but does not add attributes to the value itself. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too general or represent a different state; entity-specific findings would add context not present in the entry."
789544005,History of peripheral ischemia (situation),Chart lists history of peripheral ischemia,"This indicates that the chart includes an entry of peripheral ischemia in the patient's history, which is a past situation rather than a current finding. No specifics beyond the condition and historical context are included. The category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 789544005 is appropriate as it directly represents history of peripheral ischemia. Parent terms would be too broad, sibling terms would represent different conditions, and child terms would be more specific than what is documented here."
472886009,Swab from gastrostomy stoma (specimen),Swab sample taken at gastrostomy stoma,"The entry focuses on a swab sample and the source location (gastrostomy stoma), which are the defining elements of the specimen concept. It maps to the Specimen category and precisely to SCTID 472886009. Broader or sibling concepts would either generalize the specimen type or misidentify the stoma. The phrasing is a clear paraphrase that maintains equivalence and avoids adding extraneous attributes."
246756004,Torsion deviation of eye (finding),Torsional deviation on ocular alignment testing,"The entry reports torsional deviation identified during alignment testing, which is a Clinical finding. It matches SNOMED CT 246756004 and avoids specifying direction, laterality, extent, or cause. Parent concepts like general misalignment are too broad, and child concepts specifying torsion direction or type are not supported by the text."
170688000,Lithium stopped (situation),Medication list updated: lithium stopped.,"This entry denotes the medication list has been updated to reflect that lithium is stopped, without any reason or timing detail. Category: Situation. Lithium stopped (situation) SCTID 170688000 is the correct code as it represents the cessation of lithium therapy. Parent concepts would be too general, and sibling concepts such as Prescription cancelled or Lithium not on medication list would misrepresent the clinical situation. The context of an updated list does not change the core concept."
309931003,Clinical molecular genetics department (environment),Within the clinical molecular genetics department,"The phrase situates activities within the clinical molecular genetics department, focusing solely on the environment/location. It should be coded to SNOMED CT 309931003 (Environment). It does not introduce any additional attributes or suggest a different unit such as a laboratory or non-departmental service."
1004049005,Exposure to extreme temperature (event),Incident report indicates exposure to extreme temperature,"This line documents the presence of an exposure event to temperature extremes. No hot/cold direction, cause, or outcome is specified. The concept is an Event in SNOMED CT, best represented by Exposure to extreme temperature (event), SCTID 1004049005. Children like exposure to heat or cold are not supported by the wording, and a parent concept would be overly broad. The incident-report context does not add clinical attributes, so the chosen code remains precise."
86308005,Product containing sympathomimetic (product),Medication list item: sympathomimetic medicine,"This entry identifies a listed medication characterized by being a sympathomimetic-containing product, with no mention of dose, route, brand, or specific ingredient. It falls under the SNOMED CT Product hierarchy and matches Product containing sympathomimetic (product), SCTID 86308005. Mapping to a generic medicinal product parent would be too vague, and choosing a child concept with a particular sympathomimetic or presentation would add unmentioned details. Substance-only concepts are not suitable because the phrase refers to a medicine (product), not just the ingredient. The synonym 'medicine' is commonly used and does not change code selection."
82187007,Gastric acid secretion (observable entity),Gastric hydrochloric acid secretion,"This entry specifies that the secreted acid is hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is the physiologic gastric acid, so it remains clinically equivalent to the observable 'gastric acid secretion.' No attributes, such as amount or abnormality, are stated. It maps to SNOMED CT 82187007 (Observable entity). Broader parent concepts like 'gastric secretion' would omit the acid specificity, and narrower children like 'maximal acid output' or 'basal secretion' would add context not present here. Sibling observables like gastric pH are different measures and not indicated."
216360007,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, cricket ground (environment)",Prehospital narrative: incident site was a cricket ground,"The prehospital narrative captures the incident site as a cricket ground, focusing only on location. The main concept is the environment where an accident/poisoning occurred, categorized as Environment or geographical location. SCTID 216360007 provides the precise match for cricket ground as place of occurrence. More general parents lack specificity, while sibling concepts (stadium, gymnasium) do not match the cricket-specific venue. This phrasing is a straightforward synonym that preserves the exact concept."
1363365002,Scheie gonioscopy grading system angle width grade wide (qualifier value),Chart note: Scheie angle width graded wide.,"In the chart note, the Scheie gonioscopy angle-width grade is recorded as 'wide,' representing the grading qualifier alone. There are no additions such as laterality or timing. As a Qualifier value, SCTID 1363365002 is the precise match for 'Scheie angle width grade wide.' A parent concept lacking the explicit value would be too general, and sibling grades like 'narrow' or 'closed' would be incorrect. The phrasing avoids any Shaffer grading or general open-angle terminology."
85771006,Dipetalonema evansi (organism),Dipetalonema evansi,"The entry states the exact species name Dipetalonema evansi, which is the SNOMED CT organism concept SCTID 85771006. No clinical condition, site, host, or temporal attribute is asserted; it is purely the taxonomic organism reference. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Using the precise species term avoids broader parent concepts like the genus Dipetalonema or Nematoda and does not stray into sibling species. It also does not imply an infection or detection finding, so disorder or finding concepts would be less appropriate."
167901007,Synovial fluid: lupus erythematosus cells (finding),Arthrocentesis fluid microscopy demonstrates LE cells.,"This documents that microscopic examination of fluid obtained via arthrocentesis (i.e., synovial fluid) demonstrates LE cells. It remains a Clinical finding centered on LE cells in synovial fluid and maps to SNOMED CT 167901007. Mention of microscopy provides context without introducing a separate test result concept or additional attributes. Parent concepts without the site specificity and siblings for other fluids or absent findings are less appropriate. 'Demonstrates' is a standard synonym indicating presence."
11008401000119103,History of revision of arthroplasty of head of right radius (situation),"Patient statement: ""I had a revision of my right radial head replacement""","The patient’s quote communicates a past procedure (“I had”) and a “revision” on a “right radial head replacement.” “Replacement” is a common clinical synonym for arthroplasty in this context, and combined with revision it indicates revision of arthroplasty. This is a Situation with explicit context and matches history of revision of arthroplasty of head of right radius. Parent concepts without radial head specificity or laterality are less precise, and siblings such as non-revised arthroplasty history or left-sided revision are not appropriate."
237484004,Repair of cerebrospinal fluid leak from pituitary fossa (procedure),Repair of CSF fistula at pituitary fossa,"This describes repairing a cerebrospinal fluid fistula at the pituitary fossa; 'CSF fistula' is clinically equivalent to 'CSF leak' in operative contexts. The category is Procedure. It maps to SNOMED CT 237484004 because the site and action are specified. General CSF fistula repairs lacking site, or procedures at other skull base regions, would be less precise, and technique-specific variants are not indicated."
397534005,Corrected visual acuity - left eye (observable entity),"Ophthalmology report: corrected visual acuity, left eye","Documented in a report context, the concept remains corrected visual acuity limited to the left eye, which is an observable entity. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is 397534005. Parent concepts that omit correction or generic visual acuity are less specific, and siblings that add uncorrected status or near/distance attributes would diverge from the wording. The 'report' context does not add clinical attributes; it simply frames the same observable."
3457005,Patient referral (procedure),Patient referral completed,"This records that a patient referral was carried out to completion, with no mention of specialty, timing beyond completion, or indication. Category is Procedure. The exact match is 3457005 Patient referral (procedure). A parent like Administrative procedure lacks specificity; children that specify service, urgency, or request are not aligned with this wording. The term “completed” confirms the procedure took place and does not introduce a different concept."
81689006,Prostatic fluid (substance),Substance noted: prostatic secretion,"By stating 'Substance noted' and then 'prostatic secretion,' the entry identifies the prostate-produced secretion as a substance. It is clinically equivalent to 'prostatic fluid' and maps to 81689006 in the Substance hierarchy. The context does not add attributes of disease, timing, or collection. Broader terms or different reproductive fluids would be less precise, and specimen-specific nodes are not implied."
306201000,Referral to urology service (procedure),Referral to urology specialty service,"By naming the urology specialty service as the referral target, this entry matches the Procedure “Referral to urology service.” No further attributes—such as reason, urgency, age cohort, or setting—are included. Parent concepts are overly broad. Siblings refer to other specialties or to completed consultations, which are not indicated. Child concepts with subspecialty constraints are not implied by this wording."
223634006,Central European country (geographic location),Central European country recorded in history section,"Though placed within a history context, the coded concept is the geographic location: a country in Central Europe. This is a Geographic location in SNOMED CT. The entry avoids naming specific countries or switching to broader regional concepts, hence mapping properly to Central European country and not to parents/siblings like European country or Northern European country."
242373001,Accidental exposure to metal and/or metal compound (event),ED triage: accidental metal exposure event,"This describes the same accidental exposure event in an ED triage context, emphasizing that it is an exposure occurrence. The SNOMED CT category is Event, not a disorder or finding. It avoids naming a specific metal or adding attributes like route or clinical outcomes, preventing mapping to narrower children or disorder concepts. A more general parent (chemical exposures) would be less specific than metal. The wording is a synonymous restatement of the concept, making SCTID 242373001 appropriate."
1163442006,Voglibose (substance),Clinical note cites the substance: voglibose,"This clinical documentation explicitly cites the substance voglibose without adding dose, route, brand, or usage context. It aligns with SNOMED CT Substance and matches Voglibose (substance), SCTID 1163442006. Broader class terms (parent) or other inhibitor substances (siblings) do not match the text, and product or administration concepts would add implied attributes that are not present."
216958003,Overdose of radiation in therapy (event),Dose audit confirms radiation overdose in therapy,"The phrase states that a dose audit confirmed an overdose of radiation within therapy. This aligns with SNOMED CT 216958003 (Event: Overdose of radiation in therapy). The audit context does not alter the clinical concept; it simply validates the event. It avoids adding injury, modality specifics, or diagnostic exposure, preventing misclassification to other concepts such as complications or general exposure incidents. The overdose-in-therapy event remains the exact match."
223565009,Nigeria (geographic location),Referral paperwork country: Nigeria,"Referral documentation specifies Nigeria as the country, indicating a geographic location. No additional clinical attributes are present. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is Nigeria (geographic location), SCTID 223565009, as a Qualifier value. The text does not broaden to a region or narrow to a subdivision, nor does it introduce nationality or travel findings, making the country-level location the most precise choice."
87926008,"Deoxythymidine diphosphate-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose aminotransferase (substance)","Lab catalog: dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose aminotransferase","Catalog context does not alter the substance identity; it lists the specific dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose aminotransferase. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This precisely matches SCTID 87926008, as it names the exact enzyme. Parent entries (generic enzyme/transferase) would be less specific, and sibling entries would reference different dTDP-sugar aminotransferases, which are not implied."
242475007,Accident caused by ignition of clothing from oil lamp (event),Accident caused by ignition of clothing from oil lamp,"The main concept is an accidental event where an oil lamp is the source that ignites clothing. No injury details, severity, location, or timing are introduced, keeping the description to the event itself. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242475007 precisely matches this wording by specifying both the accidental nature and the specific mechanism: ignition of clothing caused by an oil lamp. A broader parent like “Accident caused by ignition of clothing” would omit the lamp source, and siblings such as ignition from a candle or gas appliance would misrepresent the cause. This phrasing uses the preferred term directly, ensuring the most exact code selection."
399716000,"pT category, nasopharynx (observable entity)",Pathologic T category—nasopharynx,"This phrase specifies the pathologic (pT) component of tumor classification and confines it to the nasopharynx, aligning with an Observable entity. 'Pathologic T category' is a clinically accepted synonym of pT category and does not add any stage value or version attributes. It fits SNOMED CT 399716000 and not parent 'pT category' (no site) or sibling 'cT category, nasopharynx' (clinical) or any 'pN/pM' concepts."
401066000,Family history of myocardial infarct in first degree female relative less than 65 years of age (situation),Nursing intake: patient notes her mother’s heart attack at age 62.,"The nursing intake documents a family history with the mother (first-degree female relative) having a heart attack at 62, under 65. The concept is a situation of family history of MI in a first-degree female relative less than 65. SNOMED CT 401066000 is the most accurate code, as it captures both the female relative and the age criterion. Parent concepts without sex/age specificity are too general, and sibling concepts concerning male relatives or unspecified ages do not fit. “Heart attack” is a common synonym for myocardial infarction, ensuring semantic equivalence."
112394008,Conocybe (organism),Conocybe sp.,"The 'sp.' notation denotes an unspecified single species within the Conocybe genus, effectively pointing to the genus-level organism for coding purposes. This is an Organism category concept matching Conocybe (organism), SCTID 112394008. It avoids child specificity (no named species) and is not a parent concept like Fungus. No sibling genera are implicated. The synonym maintains the same taxonomic intent without adding clinical attributes."
472903000,Swab from central venous catheter (specimen),Swab of central line,"“Central line” is a common clinical synonym for central venous catheter, and the phrase indicates a swab taken from that device. The main concept is a swab specimen from a central venous catheter, placing it in the Specimen category. SNOMED CT concept 472903000 is the best fit because it codifies swab from CVC; using a generic swab specimen parent would be less specific, and selecting siblings such as swab from peripheral IV or catheter tip specimen would not match the wording. The synonym does not change attributes—no site details beyond the central venous catheter and no additional timing or severity—and thus remains codable to the same concept."
215802002,"Crushed between ship and wharf, occupant of small powered boat injured (event)",Registrar note: small powered boat occupant injured after crush between ship and wharf.,"This registrar note documents the injury event involving a small powered boat occupant crushed between ship and wharf. The category is Event, and SCTID 215802002 is the precise match. Parent concepts lacking either the crushing mechanism or the occupant specification are too general, and siblings that vary the vessel type or location would miscode the situation. The entry avoids additional attributes beyond the event."
285086008,Railway junction (environment),Junction between railway lines,"This phrase states an environmental location where railway lines connect, aligning with the railway junction concept. It does not introduce causality or timing. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 285086008 is exact. Parent categories are broader; siblings such as ‘rail platform’ or ‘rail bridge’ diverge in meaning and are not suggested by the wording."
62491000087101,Tenofovir alafenamide hemifumarate (substance),Tenofovir alafenamide hemifumarate entry,"This entry references the specific chemical salt tenofovir alafenamide hemifumarate, aligning with the SNOMED CT Substance category. It does not introduce dosing, formulation, or therapeutic context. The correct code is Tenofovir alafenamide hemifumarate (substance), SCTID 62491000087101. Using a parent tenofovir alafenamide concept or any product-level sibling would be less accurate given the explicit salt designation."
429357003,History of malignant neoplasm of epididymis (situation),Patient states a history of cancer in the epididymis,"The patient-reported statement conveys a personal past history of cancer located in the epididymis, specifying malignancy and anatomic site with explicit historical context. This is categorized as a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 429357003 is the exact match. A disorder code for malignant neoplasm of epididymis would imply ongoing disease, which is not indicated, and a broader personal history of malignancy would omit the epididymal specificity. 'Cancer in the epididymis' is clinically equivalent to 'malignant neoplasm of epididymis.'"
2761008,Decreased stool caliber (finding),Indication: decreased stool caliber,"As an indication, this entry still expresses the finding of decreased stool caliber. The concept is a reduction in stool diameter and is a Clinical finding that maps directly to 'Decreased stool caliber' (SCTID 2761008). It avoids broader or alternative stool abnormality concepts. The context of 'Indication' does not alter the clinical meaning or add attributes such as timing, severity, or cause."
260570004,Transpulmonary artery approach (qualifier value),Access route: through the pulmonary artery,"This entry denotes the access route through the pulmonary artery, making the approach the central concept without adding details such as laterality or timing. It belongs to the Qualifier value hierarchy and matches SNOMED CT 260570004 Transpulmonary artery approach. General or sibling qualifiers (e.g., transarterial approach without specifying pulmonary artery, or transvenous approaches) are less appropriate because the pulmonary artery is directly named. 'Access route' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'approach' and preserves code selection."
441680005,Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index score (observable entity),Bath AS Functional Index score,"This formulation abbreviates Ankylosing Spondylitis as “AS” and retains “Functional Index score,” directly pointing to the BASFI score as an observable measurement. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It best matches SCTID 441680005. Parent categories like functional status scores lack the instrument specificity, and siblings such as BASDAI and ASDAS are disease activity measures rather than functional index scores. The use of AS shorthand does not introduce any new attributes and remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
442791007,Subgenus Indolagus (organism),Taxonomic classification — Subgenus Indolagus,"The statement assigns the taxonomic classification at the subgenus level as Indolagus, which belongs to the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy. It does not add clinical attributes or context that would shift coding away from the organism concept. Parent concepts at higher ranks would be too broad, and child species are not indicated. The phrasing is a contextual way to denote the same organism, justifying code 442791007."
419529008,Dissolved under the tongue (qualifier value),Administration method: dissolved under the tongue,"The entry identifies the administration method as dissolution under the tongue, focusing solely on the route technique and not introducing other attributes (drug, dose, timing). It is a Qualifier value and aligns exactly with SCTID 419529008, which encodes the method of allowing a substance to dissolve sublingually. Using a parent code for general sublingual route would be less specific, and alternatives like buccal dissolution are anatomically incorrect. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
170116007,Child 6 week examination not wanted (situation),Six-week baby check not wanted,"This states that the six-week baby check (a common synonym for the child 6-week examination) is not wanted. The category is Situation with explicit context, denoting patient/caregiver preference against the check. It matches the concept precisely by naming the six-week exam and the 'not wanted' status without introducing reasons or actions taken. A parent concept like 'baby check' without timing would be less specific, and a sibling implying refusal or non-attendance would not align with the simple 'not wanted' context. 'Baby check' is a clinically equivalent synonym for the child 6-week examination in routine practice."
214101002,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision with another motor vehicle, stopped, pedestrian injured (event)",Trauma registry: pedestrian injured during motor vehicle traffic collision with another motor vehicle that was stopped.,"This registry-style documentation captures traffic context, collision with a stopped motor vehicle, and a pedestrian injury, which is the exact scope of SNOMED CT Event 214101002. It avoids mapping to broader or different classifications like non-traffic incidents or collisions with moving/parked vehicles. The language is semantically equivalent and does not introduce new attributes."
1285289004,Presence of noninvasive premalignant neoplasm of urinary bladder at surgical margin in excised tissue specimen (observable entity),"In the excised bladder tissue, the surgical margin contains a premalignant noninvasive lesion.","This entry specifies excised bladder tissue and describes the surgical margin containing (presence of) a premalignant noninvasive lesion, satisfying all attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 1285289004 matches because it encodes presence of a noninvasive premalignant bladder neoplasm at the surgical margin of an excised specimen. Broader parent categories or siblings for malignant/invasive disease, absence, or other organs would be less appropriate. The wording uses clear equivalents without adding unrelated attributes."
223675004,Portugal (geographic location),Residence country — Portugal,"The field labels context, but the targeted concept is the country Portugal, a Geographic location. The precise code is Portugal (geographic location), SCTID 223675004. The entry avoids specifying regions or cities, so no child concepts apply; choosing a generic parent would be less accurate than the country-level concept named."
217292002,Hit by object falling from burning mobile home (event),Hit by falling object from burning mobile home,"The main concept is an external event where a person is hit by an object that is falling from a mobile home that is burning. Explicit attributes include the mechanism (“hit by”), the source (“object falling”), and the origin context (“burning mobile home”). This is best matched to SNOMED CT Event 217292002, which precisely represents being hit by an object falling from a burning mobile home. More generic parents like “Hit by falling object (event)” omit the specific origin and fire context. Sibling concepts such as “Hit by object falling from burning house” or “Mobile home fire (event)” lack either the mobile home specificity or the “hit by falling object” mechanism. The wording uses standard terminology and does not add injury severity or timing, keeping it an event rather than a disorder."
289475007,Swelling of vulva (finding),Vulva swollen,"The entry presents the finding of swelling at the vulva in a concise format consistent with documentation. This corresponds precisely to SNOMED CT 289475007 (Swelling of vulva), within the Clinical finding hierarchy. It avoids added attributes such as duration or cause; thus, neither parent (generic swelling) nor sibling/child concepts (e.g., vulvar edema, labia-specific swelling) are a better fit."
732940005,Part of toe of right foot (body structure),Right toe partial anatomy,"This phrase conveys a partial anatomical structure of a right toe, meaning a part of a toe on the right foot. The category is Body structure. “Partial anatomy” here is a safe synonym for partial anatomical structure and maintains the part-of nuance without introducing tissue-type or toe-number specifics. SCTID 732940005 is most suitable. The parent whole-toe code would be too broad, while child codes specifying particular subparts are too narrow. Left-sided siblings or non-toe sites are inconsistent with the entry."
262374000,Darien (qualifier value),Place name = Darien,"This form presents the place name Darien as the value, precisely matching Darien (qualifier value), SCTID: 262374000. Category: Qualifier value. The notation uses an equivalent synonym (“place name”) and does not introduce administrative type or country/state qualifiers. Therefore, selecting a parent generic location or a more specific child/sibling concept would be less accurate. The synonym does not alter the semantics of the qualifier value."
160711009,Upper floor flat (environment),Home environment—upper floor apartment,"The note documents home environment and specifies the apartment is on an upper floor, with no additional modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This aligns with SCTID 160711009; broader concepts would not indicate the upper-floor aspect, and alternative floor-level siblings (e.g., ground floor) would be wrong. 'Apartment' is an accepted synonym for 'flat' and does not change the code."
731060003,Entire canal of Nuck (body structure),Whole canal of Nuck,"This entry denotes the complete anatomical entity without implying any pathology or laterality, focusing strictly on the body structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and SCTID 731060003 (Entire canal of Nuck) is the exact match since “whole” is a clinically equivalent synonym of “entire.” More general or parent concepts like “Structure of canal of Nuck” are less specific, and child concepts pertaining to parts are not indicated."
114962007,Salmonella II 57:a:z42 (organism),Patient states Salmonella II 57:a:z42,"The patient context does not change the semantic content: it is a naming of the organism only. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The precise subspecies and serovar match SCTID 114962007. Broader or different Salmonella concepts would be less accurate, and no clinical finding or infection is implied."
288074006,Tendon advanced (situation),Record shows tendon advanced,"The entry reports documentation that the tendon is advanced, which is a situation status. SCTID 288074006 (Tendon advanced (situation)) is the precise code because it captures the status of advancement without coding a procedure. No body site, laterality, cause, timing, or technique is introduced, so it does not map better to parent or child concepts. Sibling concepts concerning other tendon maneuvers are not implied. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and maintains unique codability to the situation concept."
410734000,Joint structure of third cervical vertebra (body structure),Examined structure: C3 joint structure,"This entry identifies the examined anatomical structure as the joint structure at C3. It is a Body structure. SCTID 410734000 best fits because it uniquely represents joint structures of the third cervical vertebra. The exam context does not add clinical attributes. Parent concepts are too broad and children would be too specific (specific joint subtype), which the entry does not imply."
731523006,Entire skin and skin-associated mucous membrane (body structure),Surgical field designated: entire cutaneous surface with associated mucous membrane,"In a surgical context, the entry points to the full cutaneous surface (skin) plus the associated mucous membrane. Category: Body structure. It corresponds to 731523006, capturing the combined anatomical scope. Using only 'cutaneous surface' without mucosa misses part of the concept, while selecting a specific mucosal site or junction would be narrower. The context 'surgical field designated' does not add attributes beyond the anatomical specification."
714648009,Structure of accessory lacrimal gland (body structure),Structure of accessory lacrimal gland,"This is essentially a restatement of the FSN and directly corresponds to SCTID 714648009 within the Body structure hierarchy. It introduces no extraneous attributes or clinical findings. Using “structure of” avoids conflation with broader or different anatomical areas and excludes narrower child types (e.g., Krause or Wolfring), making this the exact concept required."
219192000,Assault by garrotting or ligature (event),Discharge documentation: assault—garrotte/ligature,"This discharge entry specifies an assault and clarifies the mechanism as garrotte/ligature. Principal concept: assault by garrotting or ligature. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 219192000 is exact for this phrasing. The parent Assault (event) is less specific, and sibling codes (manual strangulation, other mechanisms) are not indicated. The term 'garrotte/ligature' is a direct synonym cluster for the concept and does not introduce additional attributes."
216442008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, hill (environment)",HPI indicates accident on a hill,"The history of present illness (HPI) notes the accident occurred on a hill, precisely matching Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, hill (environment) (SCTID: 216442008). The main concept is the environmental location; there are no added details on mechanism, timing, or outcomes. Category: Environment or geographical location. The parent concept lacks specificity, and sibling places (e.g., mountain, forest, street) are not implied. The phrase is a narrative synonym, still pointing to the same SNOMED concept."
248958002,Menstrual loss data (observable entity),Follow-up note: menstrual loss data reviewed,"This outlines a follow-up context where menstrual loss data were reviewed, which remains a reference to the data observable without new attributes. Category: Observable entity. It fits 248958002 because the subject of review is the menstrual loss data element. No clinical interpretation (e.g., heavy bleeding) is included, avoiding mapping to a finding/disorder, and no specific measurement method is stated that would necessitate a more specific child observable."
16213731000119100,Specimen from liver obtained by needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Needle aspiration biopsy sample from liver,"This entry describes a sample (synonymous with specimen) from the liver obtained via needle aspiration biopsy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches SCTID 16213731000119100 because both the source organ and method are clearly stated. Parent terms that omit method or site are too broad, and child/sibling variants specifying “fine needle” or “core” differ in technique. The use of “sample” does not change the semantics of the specimen concept."
395689002,Transient epileptic amnesia (finding),Transient epileptic amnesia episode documented,"The entry names transient epileptic amnesia and indicates an episode was documented, but does not add clinical attributes beyond the concept itself. Category: Clinical finding; SCTID 395689002 is the precise match. Parent terms like Amnesia or Epileptic amnesia are too general. Siblings such as Postictal amnesia are incorrect because this wording does not specify a postictal state, and Transient global amnesia is non-epileptic. The phrase 'episode documented' provides context without altering code selection."
258861009,Millilitre/24 hours (qualifier value),volume/time unit: mL per 24 h,"“Volume/time unit: mL per 24 h” specifies a rate unit of millilitres per 24 hours, which is a qualifier value. The SNOMED CT concept Millilitre/24 hours is the exact match, as the time denominator is 24 hours. Using parent concepts like generic rate units or siblings like mL/hour would lose specificity or misstate the denominator. The description of it as a volume/time unit does not add clinical attributes; it clarifies the nature of the unit."
126190006,Desmopressin acetate (substance),Chemical entity — desmopressin acetate,"The phrasing frames desmopressin acetate as a chemical entity, i.e., the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The explicit mention of the acetate salt points to the salt-specific substance concept. Broader parent concepts without the salt (e.g., “Desmopressin”) would be less precise, and sibling medicinal products or different salts would add attributes not stated. There are no dose, form, or brand elements, so SCTID 126190006 is the most accurate code."
768592009,Product containing gold and/or gold compound (product),Pharmaceutical product that contains gold or a gold compound,"The main concept is a pharmaceutical product with gold or a gold compound as an ingredient, which maps directly to SCTID 768592009. This is a Product concept, not a substance or device. The wording intentionally omits dose form, route, and brand to avoid mapping to more specific child concepts. Parents like “Pharmaceutical product” are too general, and siblings involving different ingredients would be inaccurate. The synonym structure “contains gold or a gold compound” preserves the and/or intent of the concept."
285977000,Ability to control temperature thermostat in home (observable entity),Home safety evaluation: ability to adjust the household thermostat,"In a home safety context, the entry identifies the assessment of ability to adjust (control) the household thermostat, which is equivalent to the preferred term. It is an Observable entity, and the scope precisely matches SNOMED CT 285977000. No outcome or additional attributes are included, so it does not map to child-level findings. Broader parents would not capture the device-specific nature."
223691001,Costa Rica (geographic location),Nation: Costa Rica,"The label 'Nation' followed by 'Costa Rica' indicates the country as the geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). It maps to SCTID 223691001, with no extra attributes like patient origin or travel. General parents such as 'nation' would be less specific, and children like provinces are not mentioned. This synonym is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and maintains the same code."
375771000119100,Identification of ovum and parasite in direct stool smear by concentration and trichrome stain (observable entity),Direct stool smear O&P identification by concentration/trichrome stain,"This phrasing states identification of O&P on a direct stool smear and indicates the dual methodology of concentration and trichrome stain. The main concepts are the analyte (O&P), specimen (stool), smear type (direct), and techniques (concentration and trichrome). Category: Observable entity. It aligns exactly with the SNOMED concept requiring both methods. Broader or narrower observables—like unspecified method O&P identification or concentration-only—would be less appropriate. Abbreviated terms remain clinically equivalent and do not alter the concept."
223616007,Saudi Arabia (geographic location),Saudi Arabia — sovereign state,"This entry uses the descriptor 'sovereign state' to denote Saudi Arabia, which still refers to the country-level geographic location. No attributes of nationality, residence, or exposure are implied. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223616007 is the appropriate code. Sibling countries or parent regions are distinct entities and not indicated here. The term 'sovereign state' is a synonymous characterization of the same place."
223843000,Madeira (geographic location),Archipelago of Madeira,"This is a descriptive synonym indicating the location is an archipelago named Madeira. The main concept is the geographic location; SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). Madeira (geographic location) SCTID 223843000 best fits because it encompasses the entire archipelago. A parent concept like Portugal is too general, while children or siblings such as Porto Santo or Azores are too specific or different locations, respectively."
164997006,Hypersensitivity skin test not done (situation),Hypersensitivity skin testing was not performed.,"This sentence identifies the procedure (hypersensitivity skin testing) and the context (not performed). It represents a situation rather than a completed procedure or finding. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 164997006 best matches because it directly codes this specific test as not done. It avoids reasons (refusal/contraindication) or subtypes (prick, patch), making parent or sibling concepts less suitable."
763254009,Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (observable entity),Epworth Sleepiness Scale outcome score,"‘Outcome score’ here refers to the numeric total outcome of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, i.e., the measurement observable. This aligns with SNOMED CT 763254009 Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (observable entity). The word ‘outcome’ is coupled with ‘score’ to maintain focus on the numeric result rather than interpretive findings; it does not add severity, timing, or associated conditions. Instrument/procedure concepts are less appropriate than the score observable."
718492008,Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure Well being score (observable entity),CORE-OM wellbeing subscale score,"The entry specifies the wellbeing subscale score in CORE-OM, differing only in hyphenation and spelling, with no additional attributes. Category: Observable entity. SNOMED CT 718492008 is the exact match, defined as the CORE-OM Well being score. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., total score or other subscales) are not supported by the wording. The spelling variant 'wellbeing' is a clinically safe synonym and does not affect code selection."
1351490005,Simplified Acute Physiology Scale III score (observable entity),Simplified Acute Physiology Score III,"This phrasing reflects the full name of SAPS III, and because the instrument’s name intrinsically includes 'Score,' it denotes the observable score entity rather than the procedural act of calculating it. The main concept is the SAPS III score, with no added attributes. In SNOMED CT, it belongs to the Observable entity class, mapping precisely to SCTID 1351490005. Higher-level parent categories like 'physiological scoring system score' are not specific enough, and sibling constructs (e.g., Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) misidentify the version. The wording does not introduce value, timeframe, or interpretation; it is a synonymous representation of the preferred term."
285100003,Refuse site (environment),Dump site for refuse,"This entry explicitly describes a site intended for refuse dumping, which is a direct paraphrase of a refuse site and maps to SNOMED CT 285100003. No additional attributes are present. The category is Environment or geographical location. The term does not imply subtype (e.g., landfill) or other facilities (e.g., recycling centers), so the generic refuse site concept is the most accurate. Parent concepts are too general, and child/sibling concepts would add specificity not conveyed here."
388166007,Genus Saiga (organism),Saiga genus name,"This phrase references the name of the genus Saiga, remaining focused on the organism concept at the genus level. Category: Organism. SCTID 388166007 is the best match. It does not introduce clinical attributes, nor does it broaden to family/subfamily or narrow to a species. Sibling genera are different taxa. The expression is a synonymic way to denote the same genus entity without altering code selection."
215912008,"Aircraft crash while landing, occupant of commercial aircraft in surface to air transport injured (event)",Commercial aircraft crash during landing with injured occupant (patient was on board).,"This entry denotes a commercial aircraft crash during landing and confirms the injured person was an on-board occupant. Main concept: external cause event of aircraft crash while landing with injured occupant of a commercial aircraft. SNOMED CT category: Event. It aligns with SCTID 215912008 since it expressly includes crash, landing phase, commercial aircraft, occupant status, and injury. Parent concepts like aircraft accidents without occupant specification or landing phase are less precise. Sibling concepts for noncommercial aircraft or takeoff/in-flight crashes would be unsuitable. The wording uses equivalent synonyms without adding extra qualifiers."
1343408006,Fluoroscopic hysterosalpingography with contrast requested (situation),Fluoroscopic contrast hysterosalpingography — request on file,"The entry indicates that a request is on file for hysterosalpingography performed fluoroscopically with contrast, directly aligning with SNOMED CT situation 1343408006. The main concept is a requested imaging procedure, with modality and contrast appropriately specified. The category is Situation. A procedure code would be incorrect since the exam is not reported as done; a broader request without modality/contrast would be less specific. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not introduce new attributes."
1814000,Hospital-based outpatient geriatric clinic (environment),Hospital outpatient geriatrics clinic,"This phrase denotes an outpatient clinic within a hospital that specializes in geriatrics, which is the same environment as the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It is a precise match for SCTID 1814000 because it includes hospital, outpatient, and geriatrics clinic elements. Choosing a parent like “Hospital outpatient clinic” would be less specific, and a sibling such as “Community outpatient geriatric clinic” would misrepresent the hospital-based aspect. “Geriatrics clinic” is a clinically equivalent term for “geriatric clinic” and does not change code selection."
223792000,Clare (geographic location),Lab location: Clare,"This entry specifies 'Clare' as the laboratory’s geographic location, directly mapping to Clare (geographic location), SCTID 223792000. Category: Location. The contextual mention of a lab does not alter the place identity or add country/administrative detail, so more specific child/sibling concepts are not indicated. The generic parent would be underspecified; the named place concept is most accurate."
409518000,Mass casualty setting (environment),Mass casualty clinical setting,"This phrase states the clinical setting is mass casualty, directly matching the environment concept 409518000. No treatments, conditions, or temporal details are added; it is limited to the environmental descriptor. The category is Environment or geographical location. Adding 'clinical' clarifies the healthcare environment without changing the underlying concept, keeping it more specific than general emergency settings and distinct from incident/event concepts."
71482002,Iron compound (substance),Iron compound—unspecified type,"The entry explicitly indicates an iron compound without defining its type, which aligns with the general class concept. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This is a precise match to SCTID 71482002 because it avoids naming any specific iron salt, complex, or product. Elemental iron is not implied, and no clinical attributes are introduced."
789343000,Estimated quantity of intake of fluoride in 24 hours (observable entity),Clinician's estimate: 24-hour fluoride intake,"This entry indicates a clinician-estimated quantity of fluoride intake within a 24-hour period. It belongs to the Observable entity category and specifies intake, estimation, and timeframe. Context ('clinician's estimate') does not change the core concept; it still represents the same observable. Parent concepts without the 24-hour window or siblings such as measured intake or excretion are less appropriate given the explicit estimate over 24 hours."
169595006,Antenatal care: history of child abuse (situation),Midwife documentation: history of child abuse during ANC,"This captures a documented past history of child abuse within antenatal care (ANC) managed by a midwife, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 169595006 is exact because it represents antenatal care and the presence of a history of child abuse. ANC is a standard abbreviation for antenatal care and is clinically equivalent. Parent 'history of child abuse' without the antenatal qualifier is less specific, while sibling concepts like 'history of sexual abuse' or 'current abuse' would add specificity or a different temporal context."
134396000,Statin declined (situation),Patient does not wish to take a statin,"The wording conveys the patient's choice against initiating statin therapy, which is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 134396000 precisely captures the class-specific decline. Generic refusal codes lack the statin specificity, while sibling concepts like Statin discontinued or Statin intolerance imply different contexts. The paraphrase expresses the same clinical meaning as “statin declined” and does not add severity, timing, or causation."
106059000,Nervous system respiratory control finding (finding),Noted finding of central respiratory control,"This is a clinical finding regarding central (nervous system) respiratory control that has been noted in documentation. It falls under Clinical finding and aligns with SCTID 106059000, given its focus on nervous system respiratory control without specifying abnormality or normality. Parent concepts are too broad; child concepts would require additional qualifiers (e.g., abnormal), which are absent. The term “central” is a clinically accepted synonym for nervous system in this context."
865972009,Genus Asaccharospora (organism),Educational note: Asaccharospora is a genus,"An instructional phrasing that clarifies Asaccharospora’s rank as a genus corresponds to the Organism concept SCTID 865972009. It does not assert presence, infection, or specify species, so it avoids finding/disorder or species concepts. The educational context does not change the taxonomic target."
465443009,Trachea prosthesis (physical object),Tracheal prosthesis noted,"This documentation phrase indicates acknowledgment of a tracheal prosthesis and still focuses on the device itself. It does not specify presence status beyond naming the object and avoids material, size, or brand attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, with Trachea prosthesis (physical object) [465443009] as the precise match. Parent/sibling devices (generic prosthesis, tracheal stent, tracheostomy tube) are not suggested. It is a device reference."
412413001,Infant formula (product),From home: infant formula,"This entry documents that the item from home is infant formula, leaving the concept as a Product. The best match is Infant formula (product) SCTID 412413001. No subtype, composition, stage, or brand information is included, avoiding narrower child concepts. It does not describe feeding method or supply procedures; the focus remains on the product present."
411940008,Vespula species venom specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Vespula species venom diagnostic allergen reagent,"This entry characterizes the product as a diagnostic allergen reagent made from Vespula species venom. Attributes include the source (venom), the genus (Vespula species), and the diagnostic allergen function. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It fits SCTID 411940008; broader parent concepts and sibling genera (e.g., Polistes) would not be as precise, and therapeutic formulations are excluded by the diagnostic designation. “Reagent” is a clinically equivalent term for an allergen extract used in diagnostic testing."
223742001,Borneo (geographic location),Report location referenced: Borneo,"The entry indicates that the report references the location Borneo, with Borneo as the only coded entity. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and the correct concept is Borneo (geographic location) SCTID 223742001. Contextual mention of a report does not modify the geographic identity. Broader parent regions or narrower sublocations are not implied, ensuring precise mapping to the specified island."
228928003,Liter/meal (qualifier value),Unit of administration: litres/meal,"The entry defines the unit of administration as litres/meal, a unit expressing volume per meal. No numeric value or extra attributes are given. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It matches SCTID 228928003 exactly. Sibling units like mL/meal or L/day are excluded. The UK spelling and slash notation are clinically safe synonyms of the concept."
716882003,Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice score (observable entity),Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice score,"This entry fully expands the acronym and points directly to the CAPE-V score as an observable measurement. It is classified as an Observable entity, since it is the recorded quantitative result derived from the CAPE-V instrument. The phrase does not introduce extraneous attributes like timing, severity classification, or subdimensions, therefore it aligns precisely to SNOMED CT 716882003. Using broader parent categories such as the CAPE-V procedure would be less accurate, and child or sibling concepts tied to specific subscale ratings are not implied by this general score wording."
1193541005,United States Virgin Islands (geographic location),U.S. Virgin Islands,"This is a standard synonym for 'United States Virgin Islands', referring to the same geographic entity. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (qualifier value). The concept that best matches is 1193541005, which explicitly represents the U.S. Virgin Islands. The use of the abbreviation 'U.S.' does not introduce any new attribute; it maintains the same geographic scope. Parent concepts like 'Virgin Islands' are too broad, and siblings such as 'British Virgin Islands' would be inaccurate here."
384632008,"Tumor size, invasive component, additional dimension (observable entity)",Invasive component tumor size—extra dimension,The wording specifies the invasive component and indicates an additional ('extra') dimension beyond the largest. The main concept is an additional measurement axis for invasive tumor size. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 384632008 is the exact match; using 'extra dimension' is a synonymous paraphrase of 'additional dimension' and does not change the observable. It avoids parent-level generality and excludes siblings like 'largest dimension' and any in situ component.
121881003,2-Hydroxyisovalerate measurement (procedure),Follow-up note: 2-hydroxyisovalerate measurement,"In a follow-up documentation context, this entry still denotes the procedure of measuring 2-hydroxyisovalerate and adds no details about specimen, method, timing specifics, or results. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The most accurate code is 121881003. Parent concepts that are more general, and child/sibling concepts that add constraints (specimen, technique, or observables) are not implied. The follow-up note context does not alter the underlying procedural concept."
1115401000112109,Mycobacterium pseudokansasii (organism),Mycobacterium pseudokansasii noted in microbiology,"This documentation context mentions the organism within microbiology without stating clinical findings or infection. The focus remains the species Mycobacterium pseudokansasii, mapping to the Organism concept 1115401000112109. Parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate because the species is explicitly named and no strain or clinical attribute is added."
46021000087104,Microbacterium paulum (organism),Reference: Microbacterium paulum,"The text indicates a reference to the organism Microbacterium paulum, strictly as a species name. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It is a precise match to the organism concept since no attributes like detection, site, or severity are present. Broader or alternate taxa would be less appropriate."
223561000,Cote d'Ivoire (geographic location),Geographic location: Côte d'Ivoire,"The phrase states Côte d'Ivoire as a geographic location without any situational context. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). It maps directly to Cote d'Ivoire (geographic location) SCTID 223561000. Broader parent geographic classes lack specificity, and alternatives like nationality or sublocations are not referenced. The field label serves only to define the data type."
223556002,Equatorial Guinea (geographic location),GQ — Equatorial Guinea,"“GQ” is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for Equatorial Guinea; paired with the name, it uniquely identifies the country. Category: Geographic location (Location/Qualifier value). No added attributes (residence, exposure, timing) are present. Parent regional concepts are too broad, and child localities are too narrow. Sibling country codes (e.g., GW for Guinea-Bissau) refer to other entities. The correct selection remains Equatorial Guinea (223556002)."
1297254004,Entire upper thoracic paraesophageal lymph node (body structure),Upper chest paraesophageal lymph node,"“Upper chest” is a clinical paraphrase of “upper thoracic,” and “paraesophageal” specifies adjacency to the esophagus, identifying the single lymph node in that region. Category: Body structure. This aligns with SNOMED CT 1297254004; broader parents like thoracic lymph node or unspecified paraesophageal lymph node are not as specific, and siblings that imply other levels or laterality do not fit the wording. The entry remains singular and does not introduce pathology or other attributes."
285062006,Ski resort (environment),Documented setting: ski resort,"This entry indicates the documented setting is a ski resort, which is an environmental concept with no added attributes. Category: Environment. It maps most precisely to SCTID 285062006, and is more accurate than a parent (generic resort) or sibling/child concepts (e.g., ski slope), because it refers to the resort environment as a whole. The synonymic phrasing does not change code selection."
426206001,Constant pain (finding),Assessment: constant pain,"Within the assessment, 'constant pain' denotes the pain's temporal characteristic, which is correctly coded as 'Constant pain (finding)' SCTID 426206001. This is a Clinical finding. The parent 'Pain (finding)' lacks the specific attribute of constancy, and alternatives such as 'Intermittent pain' or 'Chronic pain' are not supported by the wording. No additional attributes (site, severity, cause) are introduced."
417497008,Chaetomium floriforme (organism),Record update: Chaetomium floriforme entered as organism,"This follow-up entry indicates the organism designation is Chaetomium floriforme, with no added clinical qualifiers. The main concept is the organism species. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism hierarchy as Chaetomium floriforme (organism), SCTID 417497008. Using a parent (e.g., Chaetomium) would lose specificity, and no finding or infection is stated, so organism coding is the most accurate selection."
1204053009,Aristolochic acid (substance),Aristolochic acid referenced in chart,"The phrase notes that 'Aristolochic acid' appears in documentation, but the core concept remains the chemical substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 1204053009 fits best because the entry does not assert exposure, toxicity, or product composition. Parent chemical classes are too broad and specific children like aristolochic acid I/II are not mentioned. The contextual wording 'referenced in chart' does not change the code from the substance."
6017005,Xenopsylla brasiliensis (organism),Xenopsylla brasiliensis,"The entry states the exact Latin binomial species name Xenopsylla brasiliensis, which is an organism-level concept. In SNOMED CT, this maps precisely to the Organism category concept SCTID 6017005. No clinical attributes (presence, site, timing, or effect) are introduced; it is purely the taxonomic label. Broader parent concepts like Xenopsylla (genus) or Flea (organism) are less specific, and sibling species (e.g., Xenopsylla cheopis) would be incorrect. The wording does not imply a clinical finding or infestation, so the organism concept is the most precise match."
215417008,"Submersion or drowning due to boat overturning, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)",Submersion/drowning due to capsized small unpowered boat; occupant injured.,"The entry explicitly states submersion/drowning as the outcome and identifies the cause as a small unpowered boat capsizing, with the subject being the occupant who was injured. The main medical concept is an external cause event: submersion or drowning due to boat overturning involving an injured occupant of a small unpowered boat. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This matches SCTID 215417008 precisely because it includes boat overturning, submersion/drowning, and the injured occupant of a small unpowered boat. Parent concepts lacking the occupant or vessel type are too broad, and child concepts specifying particular craft types (e.g., canoe or kayak) would be too narrow. “Capsized” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “boat overturning,” and “small unpowered boat” is synonymous with “small nonmotorized boat,” without introducing new attributes."
737357006,Fetal blood specimen (specimen),FBS specimen (fetal blood sample),"The acronym FBS is expanded to 'fetal blood sample', ensuring unambiguous mapping to 'Fetal blood specimen' (737357006). The category is Specimen. No additional attributes like cord origin or procedure type are stated. Parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling concepts would require subsite detail not present here."
16088371000119102,History of total arthroplasty of bilateral shoulders (situation),History: total replacement of bilateral shoulder joints,"This indicates a situation of past total replacement on both shoulder joints, synonymous with bilateral total shoulder arthroplasty. It maps to SCTID 16088371000119102. Broader parent concepts or sibling concepts such as hemiarthroplasty or reverse TSA are excluded by the explicit 'total' and 'bilateral' wording."
293915002,Allergy to loxapine (finding),Pre-op checklist: loxapine allergy,"In preoperative documentation, stating “loxapine allergy” conveys the same underlying finding: allergy to loxapine. There are no added attributes like severity or timing beyond the context of recording. The concept type is Clinical finding, and SNOMED CT 293915002 is the exact code. It is more specific than parent-level drug allergy and does not imply an acute reaction."
223401000,St. Eustatius (geographic location),Current location: St. Eustatius,"The phrase indicates that the current location is St. Eustatius, naming the geographic place directly. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This is a precise reference to the St. Eustatius concept (SCTID 223401000). It does not introduce a larger jurisdiction or smaller site that would require a different concept."
423252004,Home-canned food (substance),Home-canned comestible,"“Comestible” is a synonym meaning edible food; combined with “home-canned,” it denotes food canned in a home setting without adding other attributes. Category: Substance. This should be coded to Home-canned food (substance) [423252004]. Parent concepts like Food (substance) or Canned food (substance) do not specify the home context, and any sibling that refers to commercially canned food or non-canned preserved foods would be less accurate."
443704002,Assessment using Tinetti balance and gait scale (procedure),Standardized Tinetti gait and balance assessment,"This entry denotes a standardized assessment using the Tinetti instrument for gait and balance, which matches SNOMED CT 443704002. The main concept is the procedural use of the Tinetti scale; no scores or timing details are provided. It is categorized as a Procedure. Generic standardized gait/balance assessments as parents are less specific, and other standardized tools as siblings are not accurate. 'Standardized' reflects the nature of the instrument but does not change the procedure code."
34737006,Substance with C1 esterase inhibitor mechanism of action (substance),C1 inhibitor mechanism-of-action substance,"The entry identifies a substance by its mechanism of action as a C1 inhibitor, which is a clinically accepted synonym for C1 esterase inhibitor. No extra attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This is appropriately coded to SCTID 34737006, as it denotes the MoA-defined substance category. Choosing a parent mechanism-of-action substance would be less precise, and selecting a sibling like any other complement pathway inhibitor would misclassify the mechanism. It does not represent a particular ingredient or product; thus, it remains correctly in the substance-with-mechanism concept rather than a child or product concept."
408402003,Caregiver mobile telephone number (observable entity),Caregiver cell phone number,"This entry denotes the caregiver’s cell phone number, with attributes of role (caregiver) and device type (cell phone, which is clinically equivalent to mobile phone). As an Observable entity, it represents a single, codable contact information datum. The wording maps most precisely to Caregiver mobile telephone number (SCTID 408402003), since 'cell phone' is a standard synonym for mobile telephone. The parent concept caregiver telephone number is less specific, and sibling concepts for home or work numbers would be incorrect because the entry clearly indicates a mobile/cell device."
41375007,Medical evaluation of hearing problem (procedure),Evaluation by healthcare provider for hearing problem.,"This entry specifies an evaluation conducted by a healthcare provider for a hearing problem, without introducing attributes such as modality, severity, cause, laterality, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The most accurate code is 41375007 Medical evaluation of hearing problem (procedure), which denotes clinician assessment of a hearing complaint. Parent concepts like general hearing evaluation lack the complaint specificity; child concepts such as audiometry or screening involve particular methods not cited here. Sibling concepts (e.g., evaluation of ear problem) are broader than a hearing-focused complaint. “Healthcare provider” is a clinically equivalent way to express medical evaluation and does not change code selection."
412595005,Cadexomer iodine (substance),Cadexomer iodine,"The main concept explicitly named is cadexomer iodine, which is a chemical substance used as an antiseptic agent. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Substance category, and the most precise code is Cadexomer iodine (substance) [412595005]. The entry provides no dosage form, route, strength, indication, or brand, so product-level or therapeutic regimen concepts are not implicated. Parent concepts such as Iodine (substance) are too broad, and sibling iodine complexes like povidone-iodine represent different compounds. Therefore, the exact substance concept 412595005 is the best match."
43360005,Aconitine (substance),Label: aconitine,"The entry identifies aconitine as named on a label, which is a packaging or documentation context. The underlying concept is the chemical aconitine as a Substance, mapping to SCTID 43360005. It does not specify a product composition beyond naming the ingredient nor any clinical event, preventing misclassification to product or finding concepts. The wording is a context-specific synonym that preserves the same substance identity."
85154003,Total laryngectomy with radical neck dissection (procedure),Head and neck surgery—total laryngectomy with radical neck dissection,"This identifies a head and neck surgical Procedure consisting of total laryngectomy with radical neck dissection. The departmental context does not change the procedure semantics. It corresponds to SCTID 85154003 (Procedure). The radical dissection is explicitly stated, avoiding mismatch with modified/selective variants or with generic neck dissections, and no laterality or timing is introduced."
1153637007,Body height (observable entity),Vital signs: height,"“Vital signs: height” indicates height among vital sign elements but denotes the specific observable of body height itself. The best SNOMED match remains Body height (observable entity), SCTID 1153637007. This entry does not add a measured value or abnormal interpretation and does not shift to a procedure or composite vital signs concept, making parent or sibling observables less precise."
223640004,Poland (geographic location),Polska,"“Polska” is the Polish-language name for Poland and refers to the same country without introducing any new attributes. The underlying concept remains a geographic location, making the SNOMED CT category Location appropriate and the code 223640004 the most accurate. More general parent concepts or sibling countries would not match, and child entries like cities within Poland would be incorrect given the wording."
217299006,Jump from burning boarding house (event),He jumped from a burning boarding house,"This narrative sentence presents the event of jumping from a burning boarding house. In SNOMED CT, this is an Event, and 217299006 captures the precise mechanism and context. Alternatives like ‘Jump from burning building’ lack the building-type specificity, and siblings with other structures or mechanisms would be incorrect. The personal pronoun does not add attributes; the event remains ‘jump from burning boarding house,’ so 217299006 is the correct code."
442618008,Abnormal finding on evaluation procedure (finding),Abnormal result of evaluation procedure.,"The entry conveys an abnormal outcome arising from an evaluation procedure; here, 'result' is used as a synonymic framing of the documented finding. This is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 442618008 is appropriate because it encodes abnormal findings tied to evaluation procedures without further specification. Choosing a child such as abnormal lab or imaging result would be incorrect because the entry does not state the modality. The phrasing remains equivalent to 'abnormal finding on evaluation' and does not add attributes."
215546003,"Hit by falling object due to accident to watercraft, swimmer injured (event)",Clinical summary: swimmer injured by falling object as a consequence of a watercraft accident,"This clinical summary delineates an external cause Event in which a swimmer was injured by a falling object, with the event occurring as a consequence of a watercraft accident. Attributes: mechanism (falling object), context (accident to watercraft), injured person (swimmer). The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 215546003 is the most precise match because it encodes all these elements. Broader parents or alternative siblings fail to include the exact mechanism-plus-context-plus-role. “As a consequence of” is equivalent to “due to,” preserving the coding intent."
836330001,6/24 pinhole visual acuity of right eye (finding),Right-sided pinhole visual acuity documented as 6/24.,"‘Right-sided’ here denotes the right eye; combined with pinhole method and the 6/24 value, the entry encodes the same finding: 6/24 pinhole VA of the right eye. This is the Clinical finding SCTID 836330001. A general right-eye pinhole VA without the value or a non‑pinhole 6/24 VA would be less accurate. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
242478009,Accident caused by ignition of clothing from smoking materials (event),Incident: accidental clothing ignition from smoking materials,"The entry presents the incident as accidental clothing ignition originating from smoking materials. SNOMED CT category: Event. This maps directly to 242478009, identifying the cause and the ignited object without extra detail. Using 'incident' is a contextual synonym for 'accident' and does not change coding. Parent accident categories are too broad, and sibling events involving non-clothing or non-smoking sources are not indicated."
213917004,Fall on train (event),Fall noted onboard the train,"This indicates a fall that was noted onboard the train, without introducing injury details or causative factors. The SNOMED CT category is Event and maps to Fall on train (event), SCTID 213917004. A more general parent concept would ignore the transport setting, and siblings such as Fall from train or Fall in station are misaligned with the wording. “Onboard the train” is a safe synonym for “on train,” ensuring the same coding."
269706002,Exposure to toxic coral (event),Noted exposure to toxic coral,"The entry indicates an exposure to toxic coral has been noted, emphasizing the documentation rather than adding clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event, aligning with SCTID 269706002. Parent concepts are less specific, and siblings indicating outcome (injury, dermatitis) or particular coral species would be mismatches. The phrasing is a direct representation of the exposure concept."
310151004,Gastrointestinal surgery service (qualifier value),Consulting service: gastrointestinal surgery,"The entry labels the consulting service, which identifies the specialty service involved rather than a consult procedure. The main concept is the gastrointestinal surgery service, belonging to the Qualifier value hierarchy, matching SCTID 310151004. 'Consulting' here is a context label and does not introduce an action or event code; the service identity remains the focus. It is more specific than the parent surgical service and does not suggest a different specialty. It does not imply an operative intervention, keeping the qualifier value appropriate."
164746007,Auditory/vestibular test not done (situation),Audio-vestibular test was not carried out.,"The phrase clearly documents non-performance of an audio-vestibular (auditory/vestibular) test, a Situation with explicit context. “Was not carried out” is synonymous with “not done,” and “audio-vestibular” is a clinically accepted synonym for “auditory/vestibular,” keeping the scope appropriate to 164746007. It does not specify a particular test or give reasons, so more specific child concepts (e.g., caloric test not done) are not supported, and general parents would be less precise."
413602004,Australian Rules Football ground (environment),Australian Rules oval,Main concept: oval used for Australian Rules football. Category: Environment. 'Oval' here identifies the sport-specific ground configuration and is equivalent to the concept of Australian Rules football ground. It avoids broader parents and excludes siblings like cricket oval or rugby pitch. Exact fit for SCTID 413602004.
868246006,Percutaneous coronary intervention of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery (procedure),PCI of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery,"This phrasing names the procedure (PCI) and the exact vessel segment (anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery). The concept is a Procedure and is best matched to SCTID 868246006 because it fully specifies PCI and the LAD branch without introducing additional attributes. A parent concept lacking the branch/site would be less precise, and any child concept that mentions stent placement or angioplasty would add technique-level detail not present here. The wording is a direct restatement of the preferred term and remains semantically equivalent."
46121000146104,Urinary system calculus specimen (specimen),Specimen—urinary calculus (source: urinary system),"This clearly identifies a specimen consisting of a urinary calculus and attributes the source system as urinary, without indicating a particular organ site. The main concept is a specimen; attributes include material (calculus) and source system (urinary). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The best code is 46121000146104 because it is a urinary system calculus specimen. A parent like “Calculus specimen” is not constrained to the urinary system. A child such as “Renal calculus specimen” would add specificity not stated. The phrasing does not introduce additional clinical attributes, preserving exact mapping to the specimen."
223828002,Lefkada (geographic location),Patient resides in Lefkada,"The main concept is the geographic location Lefkada, indicated as the patient's place of residence; residence is contextual but does not change the location concept. No additional clinical attributes are introduced beyond the place. This fits SNOMED CT’s Geographic location category and maps most precisely to Lefkada (geographic location), SCTID 223828002. Broader parents like Greece would be less specific than the stated locale, and more granular children or sibling locations would add specificity not present in the entry."
223783003,Islands in region of Australia (geographic location),Site visited: islands in region of Australia,"The visited site is identified as “islands in region of Australia,” corresponding to SCTID 223783003. Category: Geographic location. The visitation context does not introduce timing or name specific islands; it remains a general reference to islands within the Region of Australia. Parent concepts covering the entire region would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts naming particular islands would be too specific. Therefore, the target concept is the most exact match."
256374004,Whole blood - CMV negative (product),CMV-negative whole blood product,"The wording specifies a product (whole blood) and its CMV-negative serostatus, aligning perfectly with SCTID 256374004. Category: Product. No procedural action or extra attributes are present. A parent such as 'whole blood product' would be less precise, and siblings for other components or for procedures (e.g., transfusion) would be inappropriate given the focus on the product itself."
399541005,Tissue specimen from extrahepatic bile duct (specimen),Collected tissue specimen from the extrahepatic bile duct,"The entry describes a collected specimen that is tissue from the extrahepatic bile duct, matching SNOMED CT 399541005 (Specimen). 'Collected' provides context without specifying method, preventing drift to biopsy/resection child concepts. By naming the extrahepatic bile duct, it is more precise than parent terms for bile duct tissue and excludes sibling concepts associated with other biliary locations, justifying the selection of 399541005."
223574006,Kyrgyzstan (geographic location),Facility location: Kyrgyzstan,"The entry denotes Kyrgyzstan as the facility location; the codable element remains the country as a geographic location. In SNOMED CT, Kyrgyzstan is a Location (Geographic location) concept. The statement does not identify any city or region, avoiding child concepts, and does not imply another country. Thus, the specific country concept is more precise than a generic parent geographic location and is the appropriate match."
704565000,Norwegian sign language (qualifier value),Norwegian Sign Language,"This is the same term as the preferred concept, differing only by capitalization, and denotes the specific signed language used in Norway. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It maps exactly to Norwegian sign language (704565000), not to generic sign language or to the spoken Norwegian language. Capitalization differences do not change the semantic meaning, so no parent, child, or sibling concept is more appropriate."
411231000,Plastics and glues patch test product (product),Plastics & glues patch test material,"The term identifies a material intended for patch testing within the plastics and glues category, fitting the SNOMED CT Product hierarchy. “Material” is a clinically acceptable synonym for product in the context of patch testing substances and does not add formulation, use, or outcome attributes. This matches SCTID 411231000 specifically, rather than the more general parent or any sibling that targets other categories (e.g., rubber, metals) or specific chemicals."
428675004,Republic of China (geographic location),Birthplace: Republic of China,"Here, the location “Republic of China” is specified in a birthplace context, but the coded concept is the country itself. In SNOMED CT this is a Geographic location within the Location hierarchy, and SCTID 428675004 is the most accurate match. The phrase does not indicate a broader region or a specific locality; it avoids parent generality and sibling confusion with People’s Republic of China. The context of ‘birthplace’ does not introduce attributes that change the location concept."
275254000,Open embolectomy of common iliac artery (procedure),Arteriotomy embolectomy of common iliac artery (open),"The phrase conveys an embolectomy via arteriotomy, which by definition is an open approach, at the common iliac artery. Main elements: embolectomy, open approach (arteriotomy), site (common iliac artery). SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Using ""arteriotomy"" is a clinically equivalent way to indicate open surgical access without changing code selection. Parent concepts not specifying site or approach are less precise, and siblings like catheter-based embolectomy or thrombectomy are excluded by the wording."
410962004,Gluten-free/wheat-free cake mix (product),Cake mix labeled wheat-free,"This identifies a cake mix designated as wheat-free, matching the concept’s allergen-free scope for cake mixes. The main concept is a food product; SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 410962004 is the precise code since it encompasses cake mixes labeled wheat-free/gluten-free. A parent concept “Cake mix” would be too general, and broader baking mix concepts are not restricted to cake. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym focused solely on the wheat-free attribute."
262421006,Kwale (qualifier value),Facility location: Kwale,"This denotes that the facility’s location value is Kwale, with the coded concept being the geographic qualifier 262421006. The inclusion of “facility” is contextual metadata and does not change the place being recorded. No parent (e.g., national/provincial) or child (e.g., town) concepts are mentioned, so the precise qualifier value remains Kwale."
328352000,Feed thickening preparations (product),Stock item: feed thickening preparations,"This denotes that feed thickening preparations are kept in stock, with the concept being the product category. In SNOMED CT, the correct mapping is the Product concept 'Feed thickening preparations' (328352000). The wording avoids specific formulations, brands, age groups, or clinical indications, so the base concept is the most precise choice. Broader parents and different siblings (such as 'thickened feed') would not reflect the product-focused phrasing."
430117006,Eye region cytologic material (specimen),Eye region cytology specimen submitted,"Submission status does not change the specimen’s identity: cytologic material from the eye region. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Absent are method, laterality, and specific subsite details, so SCTID 430117006 is the precise mapping. Broader parents omit the eye region attribute; more specific children/siblings are not justified by this general site wording."
108924009,Butenafine hydrochloride (substance),Butenafine hydrochloride is the named ingredient,"The statement designates butenafine hydrochloride as the named ingredient, indicating the substance without product attributes. This corresponds to SNOMED CT concept 108924009 (Substance). There is no mention of dosage form, route, or brand, avoiding clinical drug concepts. The hydrochloride salt is explicitly referenced, making a parent concept like butenafine (base) less precise. As only the substance is conveyed, the exact substance code is the best fit."
183185009,Jewett brace (physical object),Jewett TLSO,"Jewett TLSO refers to the Jewett thoracolumbosacral orthosis design, commonly described as a TLSO; this is still the same specific Physical object. The entry does not describe fitting, wearing, or conditions, so procedural or situational codes are not indicated. The Jewett specificity makes 183185009 the best match, versus generic TLSO (parent) or other TLSO types (siblings)."
216318008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, residential house (environment)",Event happened inside the house (residential),"The wording indicates the incident occurred inside a residential house, specifying the environmental context only. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This is correctly mapped to SCTID 216318008, as 'inside the house' identifies the residential house as the site of an accident or poisoning. Parent concepts lack specificity, and sibling concepts like apartment or institution are not supported. Child concepts (e.g., specific room) are not mentioned, and no clinical attributes beyond location are introduced."
11385001,Assault and battery (event),Assessment: assault and battery,This frames the event within an assessment section without changing the event nature. It denotes assault plus battery and thus maps to SNOMED CT 11385001 (Event). It does not imply past history or suspected status; nor does it add attributes like mechanism or injuries. Parent concepts and specific siblings do not capture the combined event as precisely.
16088931000119104,History of autologous skin tissue donation (situation),Past autologous skin donation,"This phrase captures the same situation: a previous donation of skin tissue by the patient for their own use, emphasizing past context and autologous nature. The main concept is historical autologous donation of skin tissue. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It aligns exactly with SCTID 16088931000119104 and does not drift to broader 'history of autologous tissue donation' (non-skin) or to other tissues. 'Donation' remains the core action and does not imply receipt of a graft or current donor status."
4350002,Removal of implant of cornea (procedure),Corneal implant taken out,"The phrase 'taken out' is a plain-language synonym for removal, and the subject is a corneal implant, making this an explantation procedure without extra qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 4350002 is the most precise code, as it specifically covers removal of an implant of the cornea; more generic removals lack location, and device-specific corneal removal codes (e.g., for inlays) would be too detailed for this general statement."
251402003,Small intestine glucose tolerance (observable entity),Small intestine glucose tolerance variable,"Describing the item as a 'variable' maintains the observable property: small intestine glucose tolerance. It belongs to the Observable entity category and maps to SCTID 251402003. No test method, value, or abnormality is specified. Parent, broader concepts (intestinal or systemic tolerance) are less precise, and sibling/child anatomic refinements are not implied. The wording is a clinically safe synonym framing the property as a measurable variable without altering its meaning."
227299007,Roast potato (substance),Diet record entry: roast potato,"The entry places the substance in a diet record context but still names only the roast potato substance without adding other attributes. It is appropriately coded as SNOMED CT 227299007 in the Substance hierarchy. Generic potato or alternate preparations are not suggested, so parent or sibling concepts are inappropriate here."
122650007,Specimen from colon obtained by left hemicolectomy (specimen),Operative note: colon specimen sent—left hemicolectomy,"This entry, formatted as an operative note, identifies that a colon specimen was sent and specifies the procedure as left hemicolectomy. The main concept is a Specimen belonging to the Specimen category. SCTID 122650007 is the precise code due to explicit source and procurement method. A general parent lacking the procedural qualifier or a sibling with right hemicolectomy would be less appropriate. The operative-note context does not introduce additional attributes beyond those inherent to the concept."
223835005,Thasos (geographic location),Thasos (geographic location),"The entry explicitly identifies Thasos as a geographic location, matching the SNOMED CT concept. The main concept is the location itself, with no other attributes. This maps to the Geographic location category (Location hierarchy). Thasos (SCTID 223835005) is the exact code. More general parent categories would be less specific, and no distinct child or sibling location is referenced. The bracketed descriptor is merely clarifying and does not alter the concept."
472866005,Swab from tongue (specimen),Source material: tongue swab,"The wording identifies the source material as a tongue swab, which conveys both the specimen type (swab) and the anatomical source (tongue). In SNOMED CT, this fits the Specimen category and corresponds exactly to Swab from tongue (specimen), SCTID 472866005. Broader parents would lose either the method or site specificity, and sibling specimens (e.g., buccal swab) are different anatomical sites. The phrasing adds no extra attributes beyond the intended specimen."
223777001,Northern Territory (geographic location),Northern Territory (Australia),"This entry explicitly identifies the same geographic location and clarifies its country context as Australia, which is inherent to the SNOMED CT concept. The category is Location (Geographic location). Adding '(Australia)' disambiguates from any hypothetical homonyms without changing the concept; it does not shift to the parent 'Australia' or a child locality. Therefore, SCTID 223777001 remains the most precise mapping."
217123007,Fall into well (event),Patient states they fell into a well,"A patient-reported statement identifying the event of falling into a well maps directly to the SNOMED CT Event concept 'Fall into well' SCTID 217123007. The wording does not add intent, injuries, severity, or timing beyond the event. It is more specific than general fall events and is not a better match for siblings such as 'Fall into hole' or 'Fall into water,' because 'well' is clearly named."
223741008,Bali (geographic location),Place: Bali,"This phrasing captures Bali as the place referenced. In SNOMED CT, the best match is 'Bali (geographic location)' [223741008], categorized as Geographic location (Qualifier value). The descriptor 'Place:' is a harmless context marker and does not alter the intended concept. No parent, child, or sibling concepts are more appropriate because the entry specifies Bali and nothing else."
701434005,Viral filter (physical object),Virus filter,"This is a clinically safe synonym that conveys the same device: a filter for viruses. The main concept is the physical object device, aligning with Viral filter (SCTID 701434005). The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The term does not introduce extra attributes, just restates the intended function. More general concepts like Filter (physical object) are too broad, and specific siblings like bacterial/viral filter add a bacterial attribute absent here, so 701434005 is the most precise code."
312982005,Entire external vertebral venous plexus (body structure),Anatomy focus: complete external vertebral venous plexus,"The entry designates the anatomy focus as the complete external vertebral venous plexus; “complete” is a synonym of “entire.” The concept belongs to Body structure. SCTID 312982005 should be used since it encodes the entire external plexus. A broader parent (including internal plexus) or narrower children (specific external subplexuses) would not match the stated scope. The phrasing carries no clinical attributes beyond completeness, maintaining a pure anatomical identification."
215971007,Forced landing on takeoff - parachutist injured (event),History: patient is a parachutist injured in a forced landing on takeoff.,"In a history-note context, the exact event is described: a parachutist injured due to a forced landing on takeoff. This matches the SNOMED CT Event SCTID 215971007. Parent concepts like generic aircraft accident or forced landing without phase detail are less specific, and siblings involving landing or other occupant types would be incorrect. The entry avoids adding attributes beyond those inherent to the concept."
168937000,Coronary arteriography awaited (situation),Imaging: coronary angiogram awaited.,"Within an imaging context, this indicates the coronary angiogram is awaited. Despite the context tag, the core meaning remains a procedure awaited, which is a Situation with explicit context and maps to Coronary arteriography awaited (168937000). It does not imply completion, scheduling, or result availability, and it specifically refers to coronary angiography rather than CT or MR variants, avoiding misclassification."
165055007,Expected peak flow rate x 30 percent (observable entity),Expected PEF value times thirty percent,"This conveys a computation on the expected peak expiratory flow (PEF) by multiplying by thirty percent, representing a reference-derived observable. It is appropriately coded to SNOMED CT 165055007 (Observable entity). The precise percentage precludes mapping to the general parent expected PEF or to sibling observables using different percentages. Using “PEF” for peak expiratory flow is a standard synonym and does not change the concept."
256383009,Red cells - supplemented - buffy coat removed - CMV negative (product),"Supplemented RBCs, buffy coat removed, CMV seronegative.","The entry features red blood cells that are supplemented, buffy coat removed, and CMV seronegative. 'CMV seronegative' is synonymous with CMV negative in this context. The concept is a Product. Parent concepts would lack either CMV status or the specific processing steps; sibling/child concepts introduce additional characteristics like irradiation or washing, which are absent here. SCTID 256383009 matches exactly."
860944004,No trophic change of skin (situation),Patient report: no trophic skin changes.,"This captures a patient-reported absence of trophic changes in the skin, still expressing the same negated clinical concept without added attributes such as site, severity, or cause. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and the most accurate code is 860944004. Parent concepts for general absence or normal skin are too broad, while sibling concepts indicating presence are incorrect. The patient-report context does not change the clinical meaning and remains equivalent to 'No trophic change of skin.'"
785335004,Product containing interferon gamma inhibitor (product),Prescription product: interferon gamma inhibitor,"This phrase identifies a product for prescription that is defined by interferon gamma inhibition, which is equivalent to the SNOMED CT Product concept 785335004. The category is Product. No additional details (e.g., dose, form, route, brand, indication) are given, so child concepts are not implicated. Parent concepts like general prescription immunomodulators are too broad, and sibling concepts focusing on other interferons would not fit. The term 'prescription product' is a context label that does not change the code."
719933003,Drotaverine (substance),Drotaverine cited in report,"A report citation that names drotaverine, without any product, dose, route, or salt details, corresponds to the Substance concept. More specific product or salt concepts are not justified, and broader parent classes are imprecise. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; the best match is Drotaverine (substance), SCTID 719933003."
1237234002,Specimen from hemorrhagic ovarian cyst obtained by aspiration (specimen),Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst aspirate,"The entry explicitly denotes an aspirate taken from a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, which matches the source (hemorrhagic ovarian cyst) and acquisition method (aspiration) required by the concept. Category: Specimen. This is the most precise fit for SCTID 1237234002 because it captures both the hemorrhagic nature of the ovarian cyst and that the specimen was obtained by aspiration. A parent concept like “ovarian cyst aspirate” would omit the hemorrhagic qualifier, and a sibling such as “specimen from hemorrhagic ovarian cyst” without the aspiration method would be incomplete. More specific children (e.g., fine-needle aspiration) or different methods (e.g., excision/biopsy) are less appropriate. “Aspirate” is a standard clinical synonym for material obtained by aspiration and does not change the code selection."
224870001,Community college (environment),Community college site,"The word 'site' functions as a synonym for place/environment and is specified as a community college. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224870001 is the correct match, as it denotes the community college environment. Parent concepts like educational site do not capture the specificity, and sibling sites (university, high school) are different. The entry avoids child references such as specific campus zones."
420576007,Virginia (geographic location),State of Virginia,"The phrase denotes the U.S. state named Virginia, directly aligning with the concept Virginia (geographic location). The main concept is the state-level geographic location (SNOMED CT category: Geographic location). This is more specific than a parent category like United States or general geographic location, and it avoids siblings and children such as West Virginia or cities within Virginia. The wording 'State of' is a clinically safe synonym emphasizing the same geopolitical entity without adding extra attributes."
138081000119104,Family history of hematuria (situation),Screening rationale: family history of hematuria,"This entry cites family history of hematuria as the rationale for screening, documenting hematuria among relatives. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It precisely corresponds to Family history of hematuria; the mention of screening context does not alter the underlying concept or add new attributes such as subtype or relative type. Parent family history codes would be too broad, and personal hematuria codes would be incorrect. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase."
96281001,Product containing bisphosphonate (product),Start bisphosphonate drug,"This statement references initiating therapy with a drug in the bisphosphonate class, but the codable concept is the product itself: Product containing bisphosphonate (96281001). It does not specify a particular agent (e.g., ibandronic acid) or dosage form, so children or siblings are not appropriate. The action ""start"" is contextual and does not change the selection of the product-level concept within the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category."
401107009,Excision of cyst of male hydatid of Morgagni (procedure),Excision of cyst in the appendix testis performed,"The concept is completion of an excision of a cyst within the appendix testis (male hydatid of Morgagni). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The word “performed” is contextual and does not alter the nature of the procedure, thus SCTID 401107009 is appropriate. Parent concepts that are site-agnostic or testis-wide are less precise, and siblings affecting other appendages are not supported by the wording. No approach, laterality, or complication is introduced."
308414007,Rubella titer call (procedure),Phone notification of rubella titer,"This statement documents that rubella titer results were notified via telephone. Attributes identify a phone-based communication about rubella titer; it does not include any result content or interpretation. It is a Procedure in SNOMED CT. SCTID 308414007 is most precise because it encodes a rubella titer call. A parent like general result notification or telephone encounter is less specific, and child/sibling concepts about testing or interpretations are not reflected here. The term “notification” is a safe synonym for communicating results by phone without altering the intended concept."
288599003,Able to use verbal communication (finding),Verbal communication present,"This entry documents the presence of verbal communication ability, aligning with the Clinical finding 'Able to use verbal communication' (SCTID 288599003). It does not add severity or quality descriptors; it simply notes capability. The parent concept 'Able to communicate' lacks the specified mode, and siblings dealing with non-verbal communication or speech quality do not match the intent. 'Present' here is a neutral way to indicate the ability, keeping the code selection precise."
428066000,Family Anaeroplasmataceae (organism),History entry: Anaeroplasmataceae,"A history entry simply records the organism family name Anaeroplasmataceae without any detection or condition attributes. This corresponds to an Organism in SNOMED CT, and 428066000 is the precise family code. Mapping to higher taxa would reduce specificity, and mapping to genera would incorrectly narrow the scope. The bare family name is a direct synonym preserving code selection."
242786008,Exposure to direct strike from lightning (event),Direct strike lightning exposure documented,"The documentation notes an exposure to lightning where the strike was direct, with no mention of injury, place, or time. In SNOMED CT, this is an Event and should be coded as “Exposure to direct strike from lightning (event)” SCTID 242786008. Parent concepts that generalize lightning exposure do not capture the direct strike specificity, and sibling concepts for indirect strike or injury are not aligned with the entry. The wording is a valid synonymic construction for the same event."
122557004,Cord blood specimen from fetus (specimen),Cord blood specimen sourced from fetus,"The entry clearly names a cord blood specimen and identifies the source as the fetus, precisely corresponding to SCTID 122557004 in the Specimen hierarchy. Choosing a parent concept would omit the critical origin detail. No artery/vein or other subtypes are stated, avoiding child concepts. Sibling concepts involving maternal cord blood or non-blood cord specimens are excluded by the explicit blood material and fetal source."
41425009,Structure of anterior wall of stomach (body structure),Anterior wall of stomach — anatomical site,"The phrase names the anatomical site as the anterior wall of the stomach; the tail text 'anatomical site' provides context without changing the Body structure being identified. This is more precise than the general stomach wall and is distinct from other walls or surfaces. It does not include layer or regional qualifiers, ensuring the exact match to the anterior wall of the stomach concept rather than any related parent or sibling."
67223001,Fall on escalator (event),External cause: fall on escalator,"Documenting the external cause as a fall on an escalator frames this as an external accidental event, with no addition of injury details or other attributes. The main concept is a fall with escalator context; SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 67223001 precisely encodes this external cause event. Using a parent like “Fall (event)” would be less specific, and sibling options such as “Fall on stairs” would be inaccurate. The phrasing “external cause” reflects typical trauma documentation context without altering the underlying concept."
275301001,Diameter of testicle (observable entity),Testicular diameter (observable entity),"The entry explicitly indicates that the term refers to an observable entity, not a procedure or clinical finding. It expresses the diameter property of the testicle without added attributes like laterality or values. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This matches SCTID 275301001 exactly. Parent constructs like general size are broader, while sibling measures (length, volume, circumference) are different properties. No measurement process is implied, maintaining correct concept selection."
278312000,Reattachment - action (qualifier value),Procedural action term: reattachment,"By identifying 'reattachment' as the procedural action term, the entry specifies the action qualifier without other modifiers. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 278312000 is the exact match. Choosing a more general action or a different sibling action would fail to represent the intended reconnection action. No extra attributes are included."
1431000119101,Exposure to tuberculosis (event),Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"This uses the organism name to denote the same event: exposure to the pathogen causing TB. The concept remains an exposure event, fitting SNOMED CT’s Event category and mapping to Exposure to tuberculosis (event) [1431000119101]. The synonym is clinically equivalent to 'tuberculosis exposure' since Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative organism. Parent concepts like Exposure to infectious agent are less precise, and situation-type siblings (contact or history) are not indicated."
18400002,Klebsiella pneumoniae ss. pneumoniae (organism),Genus/species/subspecies: Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae,"This taxonomy-style line names the organism down to the subspecies level as Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. It is an Organism concept in SNOMED CT, best represented by code 18400002. No clinical attributes (site, resistance, infection status) are included, maintaining a strictly organism designation. By specifying the subspecies pneumoniae, it is more specific than the parent species and does not refer to sibling subspecies, ensuring accurate coding to the subspecies pneumoniae."
434711009,Specimen container (physical object),Specimen container referenced in lab documentation,"The entry notes that a specimen container is mentioned in laboratory documentation, retaining generic scope. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It aligns with Specimen container (physical object) SCTID 434711009 because it does not introduce specimen type or container subtype. Children like 'evacuated blood collection tube' or 'stool container' are not implied, and broader 'container' concepts are less precise."
242284005,Accidental exposure to dinitro-o-cresol (event),ER triage: accidental exposure to dinitro-o-cresol,"This triage note documents an accidental exposure event to dinitro-o-cresol. The primary concept is the exposure event; attributes explicitly present are the agent and accidental nature. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242284005 is exact for accidental exposure to dinitro-o-cresol. Parent concepts for accidental chemical exposure lack specificity, and disorder concepts such as toxic effect or poisoning would add undesired implications. The emergency department context does not introduce clinical outcome or route, so the event code remains the most precise match."
710419001,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Coxiella burnetii (substance),Coxiella burnetii IgG antibody,"This phrase names the immunoglobulin G class antibody directed against Coxiella burnetii, specifying both the antibody class (IgG) and the target organism. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It precisely matches SCTID 710419001 because it denotes the specific antibody substance rather than a test, result, or disease. More general parent concepts like 'Antibody to Coxiella burnetii' would omit the Ig class, and siblings such as 'IgM antibody to Coxiella burnetii' refer to different isotypes. Child concepts that add phase specificity (e.g., phase I or phase II IgG) are not stated here. The wording is a direct synonym for the preferred term without adding attributes."
734970004,Tropatepine hydrochloride (substance),Inventory: tropatepine hydrochloride,"Listing the inventory item as tropatepine hydrochloride refers to the stored chemical substance, not a specific product formulation. This maps to the Substance hierarchy and specifically to Tropatepine hydrochloride (substance). Absence of dose form, strength, or brand precludes product-level coding. The entry names the hydrochloride salt, providing greater specificity than the parent tropatepine substance, so SCTID 734970004 is appropriate."
246464006,Function (observable entity),Function,"The entry states only the observable concept “Function,” with no qualifiers, results, organ/system references, or procedural language. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This matches the generic property intended by Function (observable entity) and is more precise than parent concepts like Observable entity, and more appropriate than child or sibling concepts such as renal function or functional status, which would add scope or imply a finding. No added attributes are present, so the general observable concept 246464006 is the exact fit."
730691004,Entire bone tissue of short bone (body structure),Imaging report term: whole bone tissue of a short bone,"Within an imaging context, the entry specifies the whole bone tissue of a short bone, i.e., the entire osseous tissue. Category: Body structure. This matches SCTID 730691004, not a procedure or specimen concept, because it names an anatomical structure. It is not narrowed to specific short bones (avoiding children) and is more specific than the parent concept “short bone.” It excludes siblings that refer to long, flat, or irregular bones."
421251002,Dried herb (qualifier value),Patient states product is dried herb,"A patient-reported context indicates the product form is 'dried herb', without specifying plant identity, dose, route, or indication. This remains a Qualifier value and maps to Dried herb (qualifier value) [421251002]. Using a parent concept would omit the 'dried' qualifier, and sibling forms (e.g., extract, capsule, fresh herb) are not expressed. The patient phrasing is equivalent in meaning and does not change code selection."
280858003,Entire body of fifth lumbar vertebra (body structure),Imaging focus: L5 vertebral body,"In a radiology context, this indicates the imaged structure is the vertebral body at L5. No disease or subregions are described. Category: Body structure. The concept “Entire body of fifth lumbar vertebra” fits because the wording points specifically to the body component at L5. Parent or sibling concepts involving other parts of the L5 vertebra or different vertebrae are not appropriate. No child structures like endplates are mentioned, maintaining the correct granularity."
134285005,Reads Bengali (finding),Reads Bengali text,"This wording conveys the capacity to read written Bengali content, which is equivalent to the finding of reading Bengali. It is a Clinical finding. The SNOMED CT concept 134285005 is the most accurate, specifying reading ability in Bengali. It does not imply understanding spoken Bengali or the ability to write, thus excluding sibling concepts. It also avoids any proficiency level or time-based qualifiers, so parent concepts are less precise."
29281000087100,Genus Amorphotheca (organism),Lab organism list: Amorphotheca genus,"This entry is a neutral listing of Amorphotheca at genus rank within a lab context. It falls under the Organism category and is accurately represented by Genus Amorphotheca (organism). No finding, positivity, specimen detail, or species attribute is added, preventing drift to a clinical finding or species-specific code."
279357002,Entire rhinal sulcus (body structure),Cortical landmark: rhinal sulcus,"The rhinal sulcus is described as a cortical landmark, but the entry provides no additional attributes like laterality or disease, preserving its identity as the anatomical structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This wording points directly to 'Entire rhinal sulcus.' Using a parent concept such as 'cerebral sulcus' would lose specificity, and laterality is not present for child concepts. Other named sulci are not indicated, so SCTID 279357002 applies."
265782007,Entire eyelid (body structure),Eyelid as a whole,"The phrase indicates the entire eyelid is the anatomical reference, with no mention of side or segment. The category is Body structure. SNOMED CT 265782007 (Entire eyelid) is the precise code, as “as a whole” is clinically synonymous with “entire.” Parents like Eyelid structure do not guarantee completeness, and children restricting to upper or lower eyelid or margin are not justified by the text."
421584003,Campylobacter lari ribosomal ribonucleic acid assay (procedure),Campylobacter lari rRNA laboratory assay,"This describes a laboratory assay focused on ribosomal RNA of Campylobacter lari. It is a Procedure and maps to the specific SNOMED concept SCTID 421584003. The wording does not add attributes such as technique, specimen, or results, avoiding misclassification to parent or child concepts. Siblings for other Campylobacter species or assays targeting DNA are excluded by the stated rRNA target and species. “Laboratory assay” is a conventional synonym for the preferred term."
213817000,"Train collision with platform, railway employee injured (event)",EMS note: railway employee injured in train collision with platform.,"This EMS entry names both the collision type (train with platform) and the victim role (railway employee injured), directly mapping to the Event concept SCTID 213817000. The phraseology is clear and does not add extra details. Parent concepts lacking injured role specification and siblings indicating a different type of person injured are less appropriate. Synonyms are not expanded here, maintaining exact equivalence."
216344008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, factory premises (environment)",Poisoning occurred at factory premises,"The entry specifies that a poisoning event took place at factory premises, which aligns exactly with Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, factory premises (environment), SCTID 216344008. This is an Environment or geographical location concept rather than a disorder or clinical finding. No other attributes (agent, severity, timing) are introduced, so parent concepts (generic place of occurrence) are too broad, and siblings (e.g., home, school) do not match. There is no mention of a specific sub-area within the factory, avoiding a child concept that would be narrower."
467394004,Active-support bandage (physical object),Kit contents include an active-support bandage,"This entry describes the contents of a kit, explicitly naming an active-support bandage as the object included. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. There are no added attributes such as site, effect, or material that could shift coding to sibling bandage types or to findings. The specific device name supports the exact concept Active-support bandage [467394004] rather than a general bandage code."
764890004,Product containing protease inhibitor (product),Pharmaceutical product containing a protease inhibitor,"This entry specifies a pharmaceutical product with a protease inhibitor component, focusing on the product object rather than a substance alone. The main concept is a medicinal product that includes a protease inhibitor. SNOMED CT category: Product. The best code is 764890004 because it represents products containing protease inhibitor ingredients without specifying any subtype, indication, or formulation. Parent concepts like 'Product containing enzyme inhibitor' are not as specific, while child concepts identifying particular protease inhibitor subclasses or brands would be overly specific. 'Pharmaceutical product' and 'product containing' are clinically equivalent paraphrases of the preferred term."
281957002,Thompsons prosthesis (physical object),Device name: Thompson prosthesis,"The entry indicates the device’s name and identifies it as the Thompson prosthesis, maintaining focus on the object identity only. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This is the most precise match to 281957002. Broader parents (e.g., Prosthesis) lack the specific named design, and siblings (other prosthesis types) do not match the wording. No attributes like anatomical location, fixation, or presence status are introduced."
257602004,Dry dock (environment),Documented location — dry dock,"The documented location is a dry dock, expressing only the environmental concept. Category: Environment or geographical location. SNOMED CT 257602004 is the most precise code. Parents like “dock” or “marine facility” are too general, and siblings such as “quay” or “harbor” are different environments. The phrase introduces no additional attributes beyond identifying the setting."
305769005,Seen by audiology technician (finding),Audiology technician saw the patient.,"Reversing the subject order still expresses the same finding: the patient was seen by an audiology technician. This is a Clinical finding. The exact code is SNOMED CT 305769005, which specifically denotes being seen by an audiology technician. Concepts indicating assessment, testing, or different personnel would be incorrect. No additional attributes (reason, timing, location) are added by this phrasing."
235233003,Removal of foreign body from stomach (procedure),Clinical note: stomach foreign body removal,"The documentation context indicates the procedure of removing a foreign body from the stomach. The central concept is the procedure itself; no method, timing, or other modifiers are included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It matches SNOMED CT 235233003 rather than broader or site-different sibling concepts, and avoids child codes that detail approach. The contextual preface does not modify the clinical content, so the precise code remains appropriate."
301998005,Ability to move (observable entity),Ability to move – observable,"The entry explicitly denotes the observable nature of the ""ability to move"" parameter, which aligns directly with the SNOMED CT category Observable entity and code 301998005. It does not assert results, severity, or domain (e.g., walking). Parent or sibling observables that are broader or narrower (functional status, ambulation, motor strength) are not appropriate given the neutral, general movement capability phrasing."
715813006,Perceptions of Stuttering Inventory score (observable entity),Documented PSI score,"The phrase indicates that the Perceptions of Stuttering Inventory score is documented, with the main concept being the PSI score itself. This is an Observable entity, and SCTID 715813006 is the exact match. The contextual modifier “Documented” does not introduce a different code such as a procedural documentation concept; it maintains focus on the score. No additional attributes like value, timing, or interpretation are added, avoiding parent generalities and sibling instruments."
399166001,Fatal (qualifier value),Label: fatal (qualifier),"This explicitly identifies “fatal” as a qualifier label. Category: Qualifier value. It maps directly to 399166001 |Fatal (qualifier value)| by naming the value type. Parent Qualifier value would be less specific, and sibling or child concepts (e.g., nonfatal, lethal) are alternative values. The entry does not add causation, severity, or temporal information."
50569004,Hospital-based outpatient urology clinic (environment),Facility: hospital outpatient urology clinic,"Specifying the facility as a hospital outpatient urology clinic communicates the environment with hospital-based and outpatient attributes plus urology specialty. The concept is an Environment or geographical location. SCTID 50569004 is precise for this facility type. Parent or sibling concepts would omit either the specialty or the hospital-based/outpatient attributes, making them less suitable. The word 'Facility' is a documentation label and does not alter the concept."
782302004,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli serotype O175:H10 (organism),E. coli serotype O175:H10 producing Shiga toxin,"This description states the species E. coli, the exact serotype O175:H10, and the functional attribute of producing Shiga toxin, defining the organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It is a precise fit to 782302004 because it includes both serotype and toxigenic property. Using only the serotype would be a sibling concept and insufficient, and using only STEC without serotype would be a broader parent. The phrasing does not add site, disease, or timing; it solely characterizes the organism."
447403008,Tissue specimen from donor corneal rim (specimen),Eye bank donor corneal rim specimen received,"This entry notes receipt of a specimen identified as the donor corneal rim and gives contextual source (eye bank) without altering the specimen identity, mapping to Tissue specimen from donor corneal rim (specimen), SCTID 447403008. The SNOMED category is Specimen. The inclusion of “eye bank” is contextual and does not change the anatomical or donor attributes already explicit. Parent or sibling concepts would either be broader or refer to different corneal parts, so the chosen code remains the most precise."
411716008,Lycopersicon lycopersicum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Tomato allergen diagnostic reagent,"Describing the product as a diagnostic reagent of tomato allergen aligns with a product used in allergy testing without implying therapy or test results. SNOMED CT category: Product. This matches SCTID 411716008. Generic reagent or allergen extract parents would be less specific, and therapeutic extracts are incorrect. 'Diagnostic reagent' is a valid synonym conveying the same product intent."
53005004,Cerebroside (substance),Monoglycosylceramide,"Monoglycosylceramide is a clinically accepted synonym for cerebroside, describing a ceramide with a single sugar moiety. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This maps precisely to SCTID 53005004 because cerebroside is defined as monoglycosylceramide; it does not specify which sugar (glucose or galactose), avoiding child concepts. Broader parents like glycosphingolipid would be less specific, and siblings like sulfatide (sulfated glycolipid) are not implied. No extra attributes are added."
387688006,Manipulation of joint (procedure),Joint manipulation performed,"The entry states that the procedure performed was joint manipulation. This matches SNOMED CT 387688006 Manipulation of joint (procedure) in the Procedure category. It does not specify site, anesthesia, or technique, and therefore does not warrant a child concept like manipulation of a particular joint or a sibling like joint mobilization. The phrasing is a direct synonym and accurately codes to the intended concept without adding attributes."
309260003,Sigmoid colon biopsy specimen (specimen),Sigmoid colon biopsy material,"“Material” is commonly used in pathology to denote specimen content; this entry indicates material obtained via biopsy from the sigmoid colon, fitting the Specimen category. It maps to “Sigmoid colon biopsy specimen” (SCTID 309260003). No procedure code is implied because the focus is the physical specimen. Parent concepts like “Colon biopsy material” lose the subsite specificity, and siblings such as “Rectal biopsy material” would misstate the location. The synonym does not add or modify attributes and remains codable to the exact concept."
224024007,Yukon Territory (geographic location),Yukon Territory (Canada),"The parenthetical “Canada” is a clarifier of national context and does not introduce a different concept; the entity remains the territorial geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). This maps directly to Yukon Territory (geographic location), SCTID 224024007. Choosing the parent concept Canada would be imprecise, and selecting a child city or regional subdivision would be too narrow. The synonym expression is clinically equivalent by specifying country context while retaining the same territorial identity."
395134004,Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level (procedure),Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate quantification,"‘Quantification’ indicates measuring the amount of DHEA-S, i.e., determining its level. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps to ‘Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level (procedure)’ SCTID 395134004 because it describes a quantitative measurement of the DHEA-S analyte without specifying specimen type, assay method, timing, or results. Parent concepts like general hormone quantification are too broad; sibling entries for DHEA without sulfate are different analytes; and children with specimen or technique constraints would be too specific for this general quantification statement."
704507006,Asian and Pacific sign language (qualifier value),Mode: Asian and Pacific sign language,"The contextual label “Mode” does not alter the codable concept, which is the language qualifier “Asian and Pacific sign language.” It maps to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value SCTID 704507006. A parent concept would be too broad, and any specific Asia-Pacific sign language would be too narrow. The entry introduces no additional attributes beyond stating the language."
309071005,Penis skin biopsy specimen (specimen),Tissue specimen—biopsy from penis skin,"This indicates a tissue specimen obtained via biopsy from the skin of the penis. The main concept is a specimen; the attributes are biopsy collection and site/tissue (penis skin). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps to 309071005 because the specimen is explicitly skin of the penis, and “tissue specimen” is a generic descriptor that remains consistent with skin as a tissue source in this context. Broader parents like “Penis biopsy specimen” could include deeper tissues, and narrower children like “foreskin skin biopsy specimen” would be over-specified. Technique-specific siblings are not mentioned."
367872003,Entire spinal cord nucleus dorsalis (body structure),Focus: entire dorsal nucleus of Clarke (spinal cord),"Referencing the dorsal nucleus of Clarke and stating 'entire' clearly points to the whole nucleus dorsalis, aligning with the Body structure concept 367872003. No clinical conditions, levels, or partial regions are introduced, excluding Clinical finding and partial body structure codes. A parent concept without the 'entire' qualifier is less precise, and sibling spinal cord structures are distinct and not mentioned. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not change the intended anatomical target."
411730003,Myristica fragrans (seed kernel) diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergen test extract: nutmeg seed kernel (diagnostic),"This entry describes an allergen test extract intended for diagnostic use and identifies the source as nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) seed kernel. The main concept is a diagnostic product for allergy testing, distinct from substances or therapeutic preparations. In SNOMED CT, it belongs to the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category and matches SCTID 411730003. Parent concepts lack the detailed source specification; siblings such as therapeutic extracts or other plant parts are inappropriate. The use of “allergen test extract” is a synonymous paraphrase for diagnostic allergen extract, preserving the code selection."
312279005,Carbapatite (substance),Inventory: carbonate apatite,"“Inventory” is contextual; the named substance is “carbonate apatite,” i.e., carbapatite. No additional attributes are conveyed. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The carbonate designation ensures the most precise match is 312279005 rather than generic apatite or hydroxyapatite. The entry remains uniquely codable to carbapatite, with the leading label not altering the substance concept."
433881000124103,Combined specimen from swab of anterior naris and throat (specimen),Dual-site combined swab specimen: anterior nares and throat,"This entry highlights that the specimen is combined from two specific sites: anterior nares and throat, collected via swab. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It aligns exactly with SCTID 433881000124103 by specifying the same dual sites and combined nature. A parent 'dual-site specimen' without sites would be too broad, and child or sibling single-site specimens would not match. 'Dual-site' is a descriptive phrase reinforcing the combination and does not add extraneous attributes."
1003685002,Human immunodeficiency virus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage unknown (finding),HIV (CDC stage unknown) per chart.,"The entry indicates that, per the chart, the patient has HIV and the CDC stage is unknown, which is the defining attribute. This is a Clinical finding, and SNOMED CT 1003685002 is the appropriate match. Parent HIV disorder concepts omit the stage status, while specific stage codes contradict the ‘unknown’ indication. Referencing the chart source does not change the clinical meaning and keeps the focus on the unknown staging."
256400005,Plasma product (product),Plasma product record,"This denotes documentation about a plasma product, maintaining the Product concept. The 'record' context does not add attributes like storage state, processing, or donor details. Plasma product (product) [256400005] is the precise SNOMED CT match; using a parent (Blood product) would be less specific and child plasma types (e.g., Fresh frozen plasma product) are not supported by the wording. It is clearly a product, not a substance or specimen."
396715000,Chordeiles minor (organism),Common nighthawk species (Chordeiles minor),"The entry uses the common name with the explicit species qualifier and scientific name, all pointing to the same organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 396715000 is the exact match. 'Common nighthawk' is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not introduce new attributes. Parent taxa are too broad, and sibling species would not match."
406929005,Soluble berlin blue stain method (procedure),Soluble Prussian blue stain method,"The entry uses the clinically equivalent synonym 'soluble Prussian blue' for Berlin blue, specifying the stain method. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. 'Soluble Prussian blue' is interchangeable with 'soluble Berlin blue', preserving exact mapping to 406929005. It is more precise than generic 'Prussian blue stain method' and avoids sibling methods such as insoluble variants."
274807004,Nasal discharge absent (situation),Nasal secretions: none.,"Documenting 'nasal secretions: none' denotes the absence of nasal discharge. This is a negated finding, appropriately classified as a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 274807004 matches this exact meaning. Coding to nasal discharge (finding) would represent presence, which is not stated. The wording does not introduce type (e.g., purulent), volume, or timing, avoiding child or parent overspecification. 'Secretions' here is standard clinical shorthand for discharge."
258421004,Embryo biopsy specimen (specimen),Labeled specimen: embryo biopsy,"This indicates a labeled specimen with type embryo biopsy, focusing on the specimen rather than the procedure. No additional attributes like stage or testing purpose are present. It fits the Specimen category and maps to Embryo biopsy specimen (258421004). Broader specimen types lack the embryonic source; more specific embryonic site/stage concepts are not supported by the text."
416276004,Referred to social services for adult protection (situation),Adult protection referral via social services recorded,"This indicates that an adult protection referral involving social services has been recorded. The concept is the referral event, classified as a Situation. SCTID 416276004 matches because it specifies social services as the referral recipient for adult protection. Broader referral codes or adult protection activity codes without referral are not as accurate. The phrase 'via social services' maintains the destination without changing the concept."
242310006,Accidental ingestion of black nightshade berries (event),Patient states: accidentally ate black nightshade berries.,"The entry is a patient-reported event indicating accidental ingestion of black nightshade berries; category is Event. The reporting context does not alter the coded concept. It matches the precise SCTID 242310006 and is more specific than parent 'Accidental ingestion of plant.' It avoids siblings such as ingestion of other Solanaceae or unspecified parts. No additional attributes (e.g., symptoms, amount, timing) are introduced."
1370837006,Aqueous humor drainage tube (physical object),"Aqueous humor drainage tube, medical device","Qualifying it as a ‘medical device’ maintains the identity of the object as the aqueous humor drainage tube. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the exact code is Aqueous humor drainage tube (1370837006). Generic medical devices or drainage devices are too broad, while siblings such as glaucoma valve implants or stents differ in mechanism or form. No additional attributes (e.g., patient condition, eye laterality) are present, so this is the most precise match."
427886002,Total cavopulmonary connection with lateral atrial tunnel (procedure),Completed a total cavopulmonary connection with a lateral atrial tunnel,"The statement reflects completion of the Procedure using the lateral atrial tunnel to establish TCPC. This maps directly to SCTID 427886002 in the Procedure category. Inclusion of the technique makes it more precise than the parent concept and distinct from siblings such as extracardiac TCPC. It omits modifiers like fenestration or revision, maintaining exactness."
57551006,Iridotasis (procedure),Iridotasis noted in chart,"This chart mention identifies the procedure Iridotasis and adds no clinical modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The wording does not better fit a parent or sibling concept; it remains the specific traction/stretching of the iris. Thus, Iridotasis (SCTID 57551006) is the correct code selection."
768177004,Stenotrophomonas tumulicola (organism),Stenotrophomonas tumulicola (organism),"This phrasing explicitly presents the organism’s species name and adds the generic descriptor '(organism)', which does not introduce new clinical attributes and is semantically equivalent to the preferred term. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The specificity to Stenotrophomonas tumulicola supports selection of 768177004. Broader genus-level parents or other species-level siblings are not appropriate because the species is fully specified, and no strain-level detail suggests a child concept."
1156078001,Surgical margin involved by primary malignant neoplasm of small intestine in ileal resection specimen (observable entity),Margins positive in the ileal resection specimen (primary small intestinal cancer).,"The phrase 'margins positive' denotes involved margins, with the specimen identified as an ileal resection and the tumor as primary small intestinal cancer. The central concept is surgical margin involvement by a primary small intestine malignancy in an ileal specimen, classified as an Observable entity. 'Positive margins' is synonymous with 'surgical margin involved.' This matches SNOMED 1156078001. Parent terms omitting the specimen/site detail would be less specific, and sibling terms for other organ systems or negative margins would be inaccurate. No margin subtype or histologic subtype is specified."
362039009,Entire trunk of pulmonary artery (body structure),Operative field: pulmonary trunk (entire),"In surgical context, this entry identifies the anatomical field as the pulmonary trunk and specifies that the entire trunk is the referenced structure, without introducing any procedural details in the code selection. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 362039009 precisely matches the entire trunk of the pulmonary artery. Parents like “Pulmonary artery” are overly broad; siblings such as branch arteries or bifurcation would misrepresent the target. The synonym “pulmonary trunk” is standard for the main pulmonary artery trunk and does not alter the intended anatomy."
223728009,Island in region of Africa (geographic location),Place: island in region of Africa,"This entry presents the concept as a place, with the specified landform and region: an island in Africa. The SNOMED CT category is Geographical location. It remains semantically equivalent to the FSN and does not add attributes such as political status or specific identity. A parent like “Place” or “Island” alone is underspecified, and child concepts for named islands would be more specific than intended."
733688003,Heart valve prosthesis repositioning tool (physical object),Device: heart valve prosthesis repositioner,"This line item indicates a device specifically termed a heart valve prosthesis repositioner. The device function (repositioning) and target (heart valve prosthesis) are clear. Category: Physical object (Device). The phrasing directly aligns with 733688003. It avoids broader device types and functions, and does not introduce any attribute implying a different concept (e.g., delivery, crimping). Synonym 'repositioner' is equivalent to 'repositioning tool'."
177550005,Delayed primary suture of skin of head or neck (procedure),"Delayed primary suture closure, head or neck skin","This entry expresses a closure using sutures with delayed primary timing at the head or neck skin site. The main concept is a procedural delayed primary sutured closure of head/neck skin. SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 177550005 is the most precise match because it captures both the method (suture) and timing (delayed primary) at the specified site. More general parent codes would miss the timing aspect, while children specifying individual subregions of the head/neck are not indicated. The wording avoids extraneous attributes."
119381007,Specimen from large intestine (specimen),Laboratory note: source—large intestine specimen intact,"This lab note identifies a specimen from the large intestine and mentions that it is intact, which does not change the site-based coding. The main concept is a specimen with source site large intestine. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 119381007 is the correct match because the defining attribute is the anatomical origin. Parent GI specimen concepts are overly general, and children specifying colon/rectum or specimen techniques/types would add specificity not stated. The condition “intact” pertains to specimen state and does not alter the site-based concept."
117077005,Autologous red blood cells issued (situation),Autologous RBC issue logged,"This documents that an issuing event for autologous RBCs has been recorded, still expressing the underlying situation of issuance. Category: Situation. It maps to 117077005 by representing the occurrence of an autologous red cell issue action. The term avoids implying transfusion or collection and does not add attributes such as timing or units. Parent/sibling concepts are excluded by the explicit autologous RBC issuance wording."
260015007,Human leukocyte antigen B54(22) (substance),HLA class I antigen B54(22),"The phrase identifies an HLA class I antigen with specificity B54(22), focusing on the antigen substance and not on genotype or patient positivity. Category: Substance. This precisely matches SCTID 260015007. A parent like HLA class I antigen is broader and lacks the B54(22) specificity, while sibling antigens (other B22 splits) would be different substances. The class I descriptor is a valid contextual synonym that does not add attributes beyond the antigen identity."
161018002,Child's special allowance (qualifier value),Type of allowance specified: child's special allowance,"This entry explicitly sets the specified allowance type to 'child's special allowance', which is a qualifier value. It adds no timing, amount, jurisdiction, or receipt attributes. A broader 'type of allowance' would be parent-level, while other specific allowances would be sibling-level. Therefore, 'Child's special allowance' (qualifier value; SCTID 161018002) is the precise code."
224008006,Island of North America (geographic location),Place of residence: island in North America,"The contextual phrase describes residence, but the codable concept remains ‘island in North America’ (landform + region). SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 224008006 is the precise match because it captures the location class. Coding to “Island” or “North America” alone would lose specificity. The residence context does not introduce attributes that change the geographic concept or narrow it to a particular country."
224050006,Region of Hawaii state (geographic location),"Location: Hawaii (state, USA)","This denotes the U.S. state of Hawaii as the location, explicitly specifying the state-level unit. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). It corresponds to Region of Hawaii state (224050006), not to the Island of Hawaiʻi or any subregional jurisdiction. The phrase is a semantically equivalent synonym and maintains the pure location concept without adding attributes such as residence or encounter details."
277292000,Endo-location (qualifier value),Endo spatial context,"This text marks the spatial context as 'endo', indicating an internal relation relative to the referenced structure, with no additional content. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It fits SCTID 277292000 (Endo-location) exactly. Parent spatial contexts are too general, and child concepts specifying particular internal spaces (e.g., luminal) are not included. Sibling qualifiers (epi, exo, para) contradict the 'inside' relation, so they are not applicable. The phrase is a safe synonym."
223686002,Canada (geographic location),Documented country is Canada,"The statement records the country value as Canada, pointing to a geographic location concept. The category is Environment or geographical location, and the precise mapping is Canada (geographic location) [223686002]. No added attributes such as residence status or event context are included; thus, situation/social-context codes are excluded. It does not refer to subnational entities, so child concepts are not better matches."
180911008,Barium meal performed (situation),Imaging report: barium meal performed.,"This imaging-report style phrase confirms that a barium meal was performed, indicating completed status without additional attributes. The central concept is barium meal with performed context. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation with explicit context and maps precisely to “Barium meal performed (situation)” (SCTID 180911008). The documentation setting (“Imaging report”) does not alter the concept or add attributes. Selecting the situation concept ensures the performed status is encoded; the procedure concept would be less specific. The entry avoids sibling procedures and remains strictly about barium meal."
24936000,Emotionally detached (finding),Detached affect,"“Detached affect” conveys that the patient’s affect is characterized by emotional detachment, fitting the same concept. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps to SCTID 24936000 because the detachment pertains to emotion rather than affective range or intensity; it is not flat or blunted affect, nor is it incongruent or labile. The phrasing does not add attributes beyond the finding itself."
163582008,Nervous system not examined (situation),No nervous system examination performed.,"This entry states that an examination of the nervous system did not occur, which is exactly Nervous system not examined (SCTID 163582008). SNOMED CT category: Situation. The phrasing does not introduce any reason or partiality, avoiding siblings such as refusal, inability, or documentation issues. It is more specific than parent concepts covering any body system."
343121000119104,Visual discomfort of bilateral eyes (finding),"Visual discomfort, OU","The entry uses 'OU' (oculus uterque) to denote both eyes, combined with 'visual discomfort.' The core concept is bilateral visual discomfort, making this a Clinical finding. This is an exact match to the SNOMED concept because the laterality is inherent and explicit. It avoids mapping to the parent 'Visual discomfort' by specifying OU and does not introduce attributes that would suggest a child or sibling concept. 'OU' is standard clinical shorthand and does not alter meaning."
1268604006,Presence of direct invasion by primary malignant neoplasm of lung to venous structure (observable entity),Direct invasion into venous structures from the primary pulmonary carcinoma is present,"This notes present direct invasion into venous structures from a primary pulmonary carcinoma, with 'pulmonary carcinoma' synonymous with primary lung malignancy. Attributes: source (primary lung), target (venous structure), mechanism (direct invasion), status (present). SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. It maps to SCTID 1268604006. Parent concepts that are less specific or siblings involving arteries/lymphatics are not appropriate; children naming specific veins are not indicated by the wording."
161123000,Approved school (environment),Context: approved school,"This entry identifies the contextual environment as an approved school. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The precise code is 161123000 Approved school (environment) because the environment explicitly includes the approval qualifier. A parent like School (environment) lacks that qualifier, and siblings indicating types of schools would be inappropriate. 'Context' is a documentation label that preserves the underlying environment concept."
35261000087106,Bone screw submitted as specimen (specimen),Bone fixation screw submitted as specimen,"The phrase 'bone fixation screw' is a clinically equivalent synonym for bone screw, indicating the same orthopedic device use and type. It explicitly states submission as a specimen. Main concept: bone screw specimen; category: Specimen. This maps precisely to Bone screw submitted as specimen (specimen), SCTID 35261000087106. Broader parent concepts (e.g., device specimen) or sibling devices (plates, rods) do not match the specified screw. The synonym maintains equivalence and does not introduce new attributes."
734994004,Structure of peripheral nerve of hand (body structure),Body structure — peripheral nerve of hand,"The entry is a noun phrase identifying an anatomical body structure, namely a peripheral nerve situated in the hand. It aligns exactly with 'Structure of peripheral nerve of hand' (734994004). Selecting a parent like 'Peripheral nerve structure' would lose the hand site, and selecting a child (e.g., a specific digital nerve) would add detail not present. The dash and context marker do not alter the anatomical meaning."
441921000124106,Inadequate mineral intake (finding),Screening: inadequate mineral intake,"Adding 'Screening' conveys the documentation context, but the clinical content remains an intake finding: insufficient minerals consumed. No additional attributes or specific minerals are stated, so it does not map to a child concept or suggest a deficiency disorder. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, and the precise match is Inadequate mineral intake."
1268838000,Meningococcus immune status (observable entity),Follow-up header: meningococcal immune status,"In a follow-up note header, the phrase refers to the immune status observable for meningococcus, with no stated value. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The most precise code is 1268838000, which captures the organism-specific immune status concept. Parent concepts lack pathogen specificity, and sibling findings or immunization status would introduce result or vaccination semantics not present here. The context does not transform it into a procedure or test."
171057006,Pregnancy alcohol education (procedure),Patient education: alcohol in pregnancy,"The entry describes a patient education procedure with content focused on alcohol within the pregnancy context. No other attributes (e.g., timing beyond pregnancy, severity, screening) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This aligns exactly with Pregnancy alcohol education (171057006). A broader code like Patient education would omit the pregnancy and alcohol specificity, and the sibling category of counseling is not indicated here since the term is educational, not therapeutic counseling."
782555009,Allergy to cow's milk protein (finding),Allergy: cow's milk protein,"Another common allergy list format, identifying the allergen as cow’s milk protein. Category: Clinical finding. This precisely matches 782555009, not a parent like milk allergy nor a child such as casein/whey protein allergy. The colon is contextual formatting; it does not add non-core attributes."
731762000,Entire blood vessel of liver (body structure),Site term for mapping: liver vasculature,"Main concept: the vasculature of the liver, i.e., its blood vessels, identified as a site term for mapping. Explicit attributes: liver and vasculature; no specification of arterial/venous type or portion. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This is synonymous with 'blood vessel of liver' and aligns with 'Entire blood vessel of liver' (731762000). Parent 'Vasculature' or 'Blood vessel' is under-specified; child concepts naming specific vessels would over-specify the entry. The mapping context is neutral and does not add clinical attributes."
7403002,Orthodontic (qualifier value),Orthodontic nature,"The wording denotes that the nature or character of the item is orthodontic, acting purely as an attributive qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 7403002 is the most precise as it captures the adjectival value. Larger-parent domains like dental-related are less specific, while sibling qualifiers in other subdisciplines would be incorrect. It is not a clinical finding or procedure."
258560004,Oral saliva specimen (specimen),Oral saliva laboratory specimen,"This statement conveys that the laboratory specimen is oral saliva, mapping to 258560004. Category: Specimen. Adding 'laboratory' only indicates context and does not modify specimen attributes. It is more specific than the parent Saliva specimen by including the oral qualifier, and it excludes other oral materials or collection methods (e.g., oral fluid, buccal swab)."
656008,Salmonella Os (organism),Culture isolate: Salmonella Os,"The entry presents a culture-derived identification of the organism Salmonella Os without specifying specimen or disease, aligning with SNOMED CT 656008 (Organism). The context of isolation does not alter the taxonomic target. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too general or different serovars. The organism label is exact and codable to the specific Salmonella Os concept."
700994008,Centrifuge bucket/tube holder (physical object),Equipment: centrifuge bucket/tube holder,Labeling it as 'equipment' is context for an inventory or documentation list; the core concept remains the centrifuge bucket/tube holder physical object. This maps to SCTID 700994008 and avoids coding to an order or maintenance activity. No additional attributes about the object are introduced.
701900001,Magnetic cell separation system reagent (physical object),Magnetic microbead cell isolation reagent,"The entry denotes a reagent used for cell isolation with magnetic microbeads, which is part of magnetic cell separation workflows. While 'microbead' suggests the common format, it still specifies a reagent, not the device, and no additional attributes such as cell targets are added. It is a Physical object. The best SNOMED match remains 'Magnetic cell separation system reagent (physical object)' because the focus is on the reagent; device-oriented concepts or generic reagents would be less precise."
707784009,Ribonucleic acid of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (substance),RNA—SARS coronavirus,Main concept: RNA specifically of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). There are no test or outcome details. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The structured label style still designates the same substance as SCTID 707784009. A parent like Viral RNA lacks organism specificity; sibling concepts for different coronaviruses would not fit because the entry states SARS coronavirus. The dash formatting is a presentation variant and does not alter the semantic equivalence.
223567001,Senegal (geographic location),Place of birth: Senegal,"The entry specifies the place of birth as Senegal, with the core concept being the geographic location of the country. The context pertains to birth documentation but does not alter the location code selection. In SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location (Location), and SCTID 223567001 exactly denotes Senegal. A parent concept like continent or a child concept like a city would be less appropriate given the explicit country-level reference. The phrase remains semantically equivalent to simply coding the location Senegal."
224052003,Kauai (geographic location),Place: Kauai,"The phrase 'Place: Kauai' denotes that the place being referenced is Kauai, the island. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). This maps to SCTID 224052003 without introducing administrative qualifiers or broader regions. Parent concepts (Hawaii) or sibling islands are not indicated, and no child place names are presented, preserving precise coding to the island."
272181003,Clinical equipment and/or device (physical object),Record field: clinical equipment or device,"As a record field label, the entry retains the inclusive 'equipment or device' construction and clinical context without adding specifics such as type, function, or ownership. The main concept is a clinical physical object category. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 272181003 is the exact match since it encompasses both equipment and devices. Choosing only 'Clinical equipment' or only 'Clinical device' would narrow the scope, and using 'Physical object' would be too generic. The field label is a synonymous representation of the concept."
701604007,Custom-made bioabsorbable tracheal stent (physical object),Chart label: custom-made bioabsorbable tracheal stent device,"Presented as a chart label, the object named is a custom-made, bioabsorbable stent designed for the trachea. The main concept includes the tracheal stent device, a customization attribute, and the bioabsorbable material property. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). This corresponds to 701604007, which encompasses all specified attributes. General parents (e.g., “Tracheal stent”) or partial-attribute concepts (e.g., bioabsorbable without custom) are less precise, and siblings for other airway sites or different materials would be inappropriate. The contextual text does not add procedural details or presence, maintaining a device designation."
703761003,Two hours after seventy five grams of glucose by mouth (qualifier value),2h post-75g glucose administered by mouth,"This entry conveys a timepoint 2 hours after a 75 g glucose dose given by mouth. Main concept: timing qualifier tied to oral glucose. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 703761003 is the precise code, reflecting two hours after seventy-five grams of glucose administered orally. Parent qualifiers without dose or time specificity are too general, and siblings with different timing (e.g., 1h) or dosage (e.g., 50 g) are incorrect. The phrasing 'post-' (after) and 'administered by mouth' (oral route) are synonyms that do not introduce additional attributes."
364919006,Finding related to ability to alternate between sitting and standing (finding),Follow-up: finding related to ability to alternate between sitting and standing,"This follow-up entry documents a clinical finding concerning the ability to alternate between sitting and standing without asserting an outcome. The SNOMED category is Clinical finding, mapping to SCTID 364919006. Parent categories are overly broad, and child concepts introducing able/inability are too specific. The phrasing avoids extra attributes such as timing beyond the context of a follow-up note and does not change the concept."
228805000,Maximum radiation target dose (observable entity),Radiation target Dmax,"This uses the radiotherapy abbreviation ‘Dmax’ for maximum dose and specifies the target context, representing the maximum radiation dose to the target as an observable. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 228805000 best fits because it precisely encodes maximum radiation target dose. Parent concepts would be too broad, and siblings (e.g., Dmean to target or OAR Dmax) would not match. The abbreviation is a standard synonym and does not add attributes like plan state, timing, or target subtype."
866169008,Elutes substance (qualifier value),Characterized as elutes substance,"The entry identifies the characteristic 'elutes substance' and nothing else. The main medical concept is a property that an item elutes a substance, belonging to the Qualifier value category, precisely matching SCTID 866169008. No type of substance, method, or target object is included, avoiding misclassification. A more general parent like 'elutes' would omit the specific reference to substance, while any device-specific or substance-specific children would add constraints not present here."
297465004,Albanian language (qualifier value),Language: Albanian,"This format is a typical field/value expression where the field 'Language' is populated with the value 'Albanian.' The SNOMED CT category remains Qualifier value, with the exact match Albanian language (297465004). The entry does not imply speaking ability, interpreter need, or nationality; it simply sets the language value. A parent like Language (qualifier value) is too broad, and siblings represent different languages. No additional attributes are introduced beyond the language itself."
108656004,Cetirizine hydrochloride (substance),Active ingredient: cetirizine hydrochloride,"Framing the term as an active ingredient names the Substance explicitly, so SNOMED CT Substance SCTID 108656004 is appropriate. No product attributes (formulation, dose, brand) are given. 'Active ingredient' is a context cue and does not change the code selection; the parent 'cetirizine' base is too general, and product concepts would add attributes not present here."
62264003,Free-standing otorhinolaryngology clinic (environment),"Non-hospital ear, nose, and throat clinic environment","This wording identifies the ENT specialty using the expanded term 'ear, nose, and throat' and clarifies non-hospital affiliation, which is equivalent to freestanding, within an environmental context. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It maps best to 62264003 because the clinic is ENT and not hospital-based. Concepts lacking the freestanding attribute are too general, while hospital-based siblings are excluded by 'non-hospital.' The synonym choice conveys the same setting without adding timing or severity."
224509008,Support from local milkman (finding),Social support from local milkman,"This phrasing situates the support within the social support domain and distinguishes the source as the local milkman, matching the concept. No added attributes are present. Category: Clinical finding. More general social support categories are too broad, and alternate helper roles would be incorrect. The synonym 'social support' does not alter code selection, making SCTID 224509008 the best fit."
1332490003,Specimen from crust on skin (specimen),Prior specimen documented: crust on skin,This follow-up note references a prior specimen and states its source material as crust on skin. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps exactly to 1332490003 since it specifies the skin crust source. Broader 'skin specimen' parents or other material siblings are not appropriate. The phrasing is an equivalent representation without added attributes.
126263009,"Human platelets, random donor, irradiated (product)",Irradiated random donor platelet product,"The wording captures the blood product (platelets), donor source (random donor), and irradiation status. Category: Product. It uniquely corresponds to the specified SNOMED concept. Broader concepts like “platelet product” or “random donor platelets” without irradiation would be incomplete, while specifying apheresis or additional processing (e.g., leukoreduction) would point to different child/sibling concepts. The term “product” accurately reflects the SNOMED hierarchy."
170832007,Blood disorder treatment changed (situation),Hematology consult: blood disorder treatment changed.,"In a specialty consult context, the statement remains a treatment change for a blood disorder. This is a Situation and matches SNOMED CT 170832007 precisely. The specialty context does not add attributes that would alter coding. More general treatment-change concepts and more specific disorder-level child concepts are less appropriate based on the neutral wording."
1137691001,Trying to give up using electronic cigarette (finding),Follow-up: still trying to stop electronic cigarette use,"This follow-up note confirms an ongoing attempt to cease e-cigarette use, matching the Clinical finding category. The word 'still' indicates persistence of the attempt but does not add outcome or duration details. The specific code 1137691001 is the most accurate. Concepts for cessation success or general nicotine cessation would not be correct here."
250141000,Footwear too loose (finding),Loose-fitting footwear,"The phrase denotes that the footwear fits loosely, directly aligning with the intended finding. Category: Clinical finding. Footwear too loose (finding) SCTID 250141000 is the precise code since the core issue is looseness of footwear. More generic or ambiguous alternatives like ill-fitting footwear could include tightness and thus are less appropriate. This synonym conveys the same meaning without adding attributes such as severity, timing, or cause."
714333008,Entire muscle acting on joint of upper limb (body structure),Anatomical structure requested: entire muscle acting on joint of upper limb,"The request context does not alter the anatomical meaning: a complete muscle whose action is on an upper limb joint. The category is Body structure. No laterality, specific joint, or pathological descriptors are included. Parents lack functional detail, while child/sibling concepts that name shoulder/elbow/wrist or focus on location rather than action would be less appropriate. SCTID 714333008 is the correct code."
223759006,Sabah (geographic location),Clinic located in Sabah,"This statement situates the clinic within the geographic location Sabah. The coded concept remains the location rather than any specific facility entity. In SNOMED CT, Sabah is a Geographic location (Location), SCTID 223759006. No sub-location (e.g., city) or parent (e.g., Malaysia) is specified as the main concept, and no clinical attributes like timing or severity are introduced. Therefore, the Sabah concept code is the most precise match."
1352809008,Union for International Cancer Control ypN2c (qualifier value),TNM (UICC) nodal status: ypN2c,"This text denotes the UICC TNM nodal status as “ypN2c,” explicitly tying the N category to the UICC system and post-treatment pathological assessment via the 'yp' prefix. The concept falls under SNOMED CT’s Qualifier value hierarchy for staging labels. The precise SCTID 1352809008 matches UICC ypN2c, whereas broader parents (e.g., N2 or ypN2) or alternate siblings (ypN2a/ypN2b, pN2c, cN2c) would not reflect the exact prefix and subcategory stated. The wording “nodal status” is a synonymous descriptor for the N category and does not add attributes beyond the staging label. Therefore, this is uniquely codable to the UICC ypN2c qualifier."
266052002,Structure of colic artery (body structure),Arteria colica,"Arteria colica is the standard Latin synonym for colic artery, referencing the same anatomical vessel without adding specificity. The main concept is the colic artery; no side, branch, or condition is expressed. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This is a clinically equivalent synonym for Structure of colic artery (266052002). Parent terms (generic artery) would be imprecise, and child terms (specific colic branches) are not justified by the wording."
104315001,Measurement of Western equine encephalitis virus antibody (procedure),Western equine encephalitis virus antibody study,"The wording 'antibody study' indicates a test to measure antibodies against Western equine encephalitis virus, without specifying isotype, methodology, specimen, or results. This fits the Procedure category. SCTID 104315001 most accurately represents this concept. A parent like 'viral antibody study' is not specific to WEE virus, and children like IgM/IgG or method-specific tests, as well as siblings (antigen or nucleic acid tests), are not implied."
55611000,Incision of tunica vaginalis (procedure),Tunica vaginalis surgical cut (incision),"The phrasing defines the action as a surgical cut, explicitly clarified as an incision, on the tunica vaginalis. The main concept is incising the tunica vaginalis. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This maps to SCTID 55611000. It avoids implying excision (cutting out), fenestration, eversion, puncture, drainage, or repair. The synonymic clarification maintains equivalence and leaves code selection unchanged."
224055001,Molokai (geographic location),Patient identifies Moloka‘i as the place.,"The entry cites Moloka‘i (Hawaiian spelling) as the place, which is a valid synonym for Molokai. The main concept remains the same geographic location, classified under Environment or geographic location. SCTID 224055001 is the exact match. The patient context does not alter the concept, and the orthographic variant remains semantically equivalent without adding attributes. Parent or sibling location codes would be less accurate."
30795006,Nicotiana glauca (organism),Tree tobacco species—Nicotiana glauca,"The entry pairs the common name 'tree tobacco' with the species binomial, clearly indicating the organism Nicotiana glauca. In SNOMED CT, this corresponds to the Organism concept 30795006. The wording does not imply exposure, poisoning, or any other clinical state, so disorder or event concepts are inappropriate. Parent or sibling taxa would be less specific than the clear species designation."
263699000,Cardiac activity (observable entity),Cardiac activity documented as the observation goal,"This indicates cardiac activity is the observational goal, emphasizing the observable entity rather than any results. It aligns with Cardiac activity (observable entity) 263699000. There is no mention of presence/absence, rate, rhythm, electrical nature, or fetal context—so specific siblings or findings are not suitable. The wording reflects documentation context without changing the codeable concept."
315216001,Diabetes mellitus excluded (situation),Not diabetic—diabetes mellitus excluded.,"The phrase “Not diabetic” is clarified by “diabetes mellitus excluded,” making clear this is not just an absence claim but an exclusion following assessment. This fits the SNOMED Situation category indicating exclusion of a disorder. The diabetes disorder code would be wrong, and a simple ‘absent’ sibling concept is less specific. The wording adds no detail about subtype or cause, keeping it aligned to 315216001."
54010008,Robinia (organism),Tree genus found: Robinia,"The entry reports that the tree genus identified is Robinia. The concept is the organism Robinia at the genus rank, without specifying any species or clinical implications. In SNOMED CT, Robinia (organism) as an Organism concept is the precise mapping. Broader parent categories (e.g., Plant or tree) would lose genus specificity, and narrower child species would add detail not present. The synonymic phrasing 'tree genus' does not change taxonomic scope."
388439001,Genus Moschus (organism),Moschus taxon (genus),"Here, Moschus is identified as a taxon at the genus level. The main concept is the organism genus. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It maps to SCTID 388439001 because it specifies the taxonomic rank of genus for Moschus. There is no shift to a parent (family or order) or child (species) concept. The wording is a synonymic paraphrase that stays taxonomic and adds no contextual attributes like presence, causation, or severity."
1193539009,South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (geographic location),Region: South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands,"‘Region’ serves as a neutral label and does not change the underlying concept of the named territorial location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 1193539009 exactly matches the combined entity. Using a parent concept would sacrifice precision, and selecting only one island group as a sibling or child would fail to reflect the full territory. The entry introduces no contextual attributes such as time or purpose; it simply denotes the location."
16211291000119106,Specimen from axilla structure obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),FNA material from axilla submitted,"The phrase identifies material (specimen) obtained via FNA from the axilla and indicates submission, which is typical in lab contexts. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It is an exact match to the axilla FNA specimen concept, more precise than a general axillary specimen and not implying a child such as lymph node-specific sampling. It remains within FNA and therefore does not represent sibling biopsy methods."
397130007,Specimen from vulva obtained by local excision (specimen),Patient statement: local excision tissue sample from my vulva,"Although phrased as a patient-reported statement, it still identifies a tissue sample (specimen) from the vulva obtained by local excision. The pronoun 'my' is incidental and does not alter the specimen type. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the exact match is SCTID 397130007 because both the anatomical site and collection method are specified. Concepts involving biopsy, wide local excision, or unspecified methods would be less accurate. No extra attributes beyond site and method are included."
411899007,Acer negundo specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy testing reagent: Acer negundo diagnostic allergen extract (specific),"This entry describes a reagent used in allergy testing and specifies it is a diagnostic allergen extract that is specific to Acer negundo, mapping to 'Acer negundo specific diagnostic allergen extract' (SCTID 411899007). The main concept is a diagnostic allergen product; attributes include single-species specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The term 'reagent' reflects usage context without changing the product identity; parent concepts lack species detail, and siblings for therapeutic use do not match the diagnostic indication."
1157322000,Antigen of Influenza A virus A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus strain split virion hemagglutinin (substance),Hemagglutinin antigen—split virion preparation—from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like Influenza A,"The entry explicitly states hemagglutinin antigen in split virion preparation, tied to the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like Influenza A strain. Main concept: HA antigen; attributes: split virion; A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This is the exact substance represented by SCTID 1157322000. Parent concepts such as general influenza HA antigen are too broad, and siblings for other strains or non-HA proteins do not fit. The phrasing remains within substance identification and avoids product-level attributes."
404299007,"Salmonella IV, group O:18 (organism)","Final organism ID: Salmonella IV, group O:18","This entry provides the final identification label of the organism, which is Salmonella IV, group O:18. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact code is 404299007. The wording does not add clinical findings, site, or susceptibility; it strictly names the organism. Broader parents without O:18 or subgenus specificity are less accurate, and siblings would specify other serogroups. Therefore, the chosen concept is the most precise fit."
218086002,Accident caused by automatic shotgun (event),"Patient statement: ""I was in an automatic shotgun accident.""","The patient-reported narrative indicates involvement in an accident with an automatic shotgun; it introduces no additional attributes like location, timing, or injury severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The most precise code is 218086002, which denotes an accident caused by an automatic shotgun. Using a broader firearm accident code would be less accurate, and intentional events are excluded by the word 'accident.' The quoted phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term in meaning."
223537007,United Republic of Tanzania (geographic location),Country field value — Tanzania,"The value 'Tanzania' corresponds to the sovereign state and maps to SNOMED CT 223537007. Main concept: country-level geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The field label is a contextual tag and does not imply residence, origin, or a subdivision, preventing misclassification to other SNOMED concepts. The synonym 'Tanzania' is equivalent to the preferred term."
420051002,Hemodialysis fluid (substance),Hemodialysis solution,"The phrase identifies the solution used for hemodialysis, which is the dialysate fluid. It belongs to the Substance category, and Hemodialysis fluid (substance) [420051002] is the most precise choice. A generic parent (Dialysis solution) or siblings like Dialysis solution concentrate would be inaccurate because no concentrate or other modality is implied. The wording does not introduce composition or formulation details, keeping it at the correct concept level."
731323007,Entire inferior palpebral vein (body structure),Anatomy review: inferior palpebral vein named vessel,"The phrase labels the inferior palpebral vein as a named vessel in an anatomy review. Category: Body structure. As a named entity, it corresponds to the complete vein, matching 'Entire inferior palpebral vein' (731323007). The entry does not generalize to eyelid veins in plural or indicate partial anatomy, so parent/sibling concepts are less appropriate. No modifiers regarding condition or laterality appear."
276180004,Head/neck appliance (physical object),Head/neck appliance identified during exam,"This entry records that the object—a head/neck appliance—was identified, but it retains focus on the device concept. It maps to the Physical object category and corresponds to SCTID 276180004. No subclass devices (halo vest, cervical collar, CPAP headgear) are named, and a parent device concept would be too general. The exam context merely situates the mention and does not alter the coding to a finding/situation."
223866004,Berkshire (geographic location),Berkshire [UK],"This format identifies the place Berkshire, with ""[UK]"" as a clarifier to country context. The concept remains Berkshire (geographic location), SCTID 223866004 (Location category). Parent (United Kingdom, England) would be too general, and no child/sibling places are given. The bracketed country is for disambiguation only and does not alter coding."
434310007,Fluoroscopic angiography of brachiocephalic artery using contrast with insertion of stent graft (procedure),Innominate artery contrast fluoroscopic angiography with endovascular stent graft placement,"This statement identifies the vessel (innominate artery, a clinically equivalent synonym for brachiocephalic artery), modality (fluoroscopic angiography using contrast), and the intervention (stent graft placement). As a Procedure, it aligns precisely with SCTID 434310007. Using 'endovascular stent graft' is clinically equivalent to 'stent graft insertion' and does not change code selection. Broader or sibling codes would be inappropriate because this includes both the angiography with fluoroscopy and contrast and the stent graft insertion in the correct artery, not other vessels or imaging types, and not bare stents."
721151003,Maternal history of gestational diabetes (situation),Documented: maternal history of gestational diabetes,"This succinct entry documents maternal history of gestational diabetes, with clear maternal subject and historical context. SNOMED CT category: Situation. SCTID 721151003 aligns exactly with maternal history of gestational diabetes. A disorder concept is inappropriate for a history statement; personal history codes would misidentify the subject. Family history or generic maternal diabetes history lack gestational specificity. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not introduce new clinical attributes."
271739002,Wax in ear canal (finding),Audiology note: ear canal shows cerumen,"An audiology documentation indicating the ear canal shows cerumen reflects the Clinical finding Wax in ear canal (finding) 271739002. The context of an audiology note does not add attributes like impaction, occlusion, laterality, or severity. Cerumen is the medical term for ear wax, making this a clinically equivalent expression and a precise match, rather than a parent ear finding or a child concept such as impacted cerumen."
47182008,Structure of posterior labial branch of internal pudendal artery (body structure),Patient statement: Doctor mentioned the posterior labial branch of the internal pudendal artery,"Even in a patient-reported context, the named structure is the posterior labial branch of the internal pudendal artery, with no added qualities or conditions. The main concept is this anatomical vessel branch. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches 47182008, not the internal pudendal artery generally or another labial branch, because the wording explicitly identifies the posterior labial branch and its parent vessel."
223498002,Africa (geographic location),African continent,"“African continent” is a common synonym that directly refers to the continent Africa as a location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Africa (geographic location), SCTID 223498002, is the precise match since the text denotes the same geographic entity. It does not imply any subregion (e.g., North or Sub-Saharan) or people/ethnicity; the term “continent” anchors the meaning to place. Parent and sibling concepts are either too broad or different locations, respectively."
223390005,Martinique (geographic location),Martinique — island,"The entry names the place and adds a generic classifier ‘island,’ which does not alter the identity of the location. Main concept: Martinique. SNOMED CT category: Location — Geographic location. This precisely matches SCTID 223390005, as Martinique is an island. Broader parents (Caribbean or France) are not specific enough, and child entities (e.g., individual cities) do not represent the whole island. The classifier is descriptive, not a new attribute."
469906008,Intra-aortic filter (physical object),Intraluminal aorta filter device,"The entry describes a filter device intended for the lumen of the aorta, i.e., an intra-aortic filter. The category is Physical object (Device). SCTID 469906008 matches exactly because it specifies the intra-aortic filter device. Parent concepts such as ‘filter device’ are non-specific, and siblings like ‘coronary filter’ or ‘vena cava filter’ would be anatomically incorrect. No attributes such as presence, timing, or surgery are introduced; it remains a device designation."
183981004,Varicose vein operation planned (situation),Planning a varicose vein operation.,"This expresses ongoing planning for an operation directed at varicose veins, still categorized as Situation with explicit context. It aligns with SNOMED CT 183981004, denoting the planned nature of the surgery without introducing details of technique or timing. The wording is not merely consideration or referral; it reflects an actual plan, which prevents misassignment to concepts like ‘procedure consideration’ or ‘referral for surgery.’"
49297008,Salmonella Ferruch (organism),Microorganism: Salmonella Ferruch,"This entry labels the taxon as a microorganism and names Salmonella Ferruch, referring solely to the organism. The concept type is Organism, and SCTID 49297008 is the exact code for this serovar. Broader parents like Salmonella are less precise, and other serovars are siblings. 'Microorganism' is a neutral classification term that does not introduce detection or disease attributes, so the organism concept is the correct selection."
439956007,History of abnormal cervical Papanicolaou smear (situation),Chart lists history of abnormal cervical Pap result,"This entry documents, within the chart, a historical abnormal result of a cervical Pap test, not a current abnormality. The principal concept is past abnormal cervical Pap, fitting Situation with explicit context. SCTID 439956007 is the exact code for this scenario. More general parent categories fail to specify the cervical Pap context, while siblings like “Current abnormal cervical cytology” or “History of abnormal vaginal smear” are incorrect in time or site. “Pap result” refers to the Papanicolaou test outcome and is clinically equivalent."
223615006,Qatar (geographic location),Location: Qatar,"This entry provides Qatar as the value for a location field, without any qualifiers relating to events or personal attributes. The main concept is the country Qatar. It matches Qatar (geographic location), SCTID 223615006, under the Geographic location (Location) category. A parent concept would be less specific, and child/sibling concepts (such as city-level locations or different countries) are not supported by the text."
46111000,Secondary care hospital (environment),Secondary hospital (secondary care),"This phrase clarifies that ""secondary hospital"" refers to secondary care, making it semantically equivalent to Secondary care hospital (environment), SCTID 46111000. The category is Environment or geographical location. No extra attributes such as timing, services, or referral details are added. The parent Hospital (environment) lacks the level-of-care qualifier, and siblings for primary or tertiary care would misclassify the setting. The parenthetical is explanatory and does not alter the concept’s identity."
428073005,Alcohol consumption screening test declined (situation),Alcohol use screening test declined by patient.,"The entry specifies the patient declined a screening test for alcohol use, which is interchangeable with alcohol consumption screening. The concept is a Situation reflecting declined testing. Alcohol consumption screening test declined is the most accurate mapping. Parent concepts such as Procedure declined are too broad, and sibling concepts for other types of screening would not be correct. The wording does not add timing or reason attributes and remains clinically equivalent."
1365728003,Vascular hyperintensity of occipital lobe on fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (finding),FLAIR vascular hyperintensity localized to the occipital lobe,"This naming specifies the imaging sequence (FLAIR), the finding (vascular hyperintensity), and localization (occipital lobe), which together define a Clinical finding. It corresponds precisely to SNOMED CT 1365728003. A parent concept absent the occipital site or FLAIR specificity would be overgeneral, and sibling concepts involving other brain regions or different MRI sequences would be inappropriate. The phrase does not introduce additional attributes, maintaining exactness of mapping."
223774008,Regions of Australia (geographic location),Address categorized under a region of Australia,"The entry categorizes an address by the geographic location type “region of Australia.” It does not name a particular region or introduce extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Location—Geographic location. SCTID 223774008 is the precise match, capturing the generic regional tier in Australia rather than the country-level parent or specific child regions/states/cities. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase of the preferred concept and preserves coding specificity."
1163444007,Hypersensitivity to macrogol (finding),Hypersensitivity to macrogol noted in chart,"The statement records the presence of macrogol hypersensitivity in the chart and does not add severity, timing, or reaction details. This is a Clinical finding that matches SCTID 1163444007 Hypersensitivity to macrogol (finding). The documentation context ('noted in chart') does not shift the concept to a 'history of' or 'adverse reaction' code. Parent and sibling concepts are less precise because this entry specifies the substance and the hypersensitivity without additional mechanisms."
422870000,Branta bernicla (organism),Brant (goose species),"“Brant” used with the clarifying phrase “goose species” indicates the bird species Branta bernicla. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This points to the exact species concept SCTID 422870000 and avoids mapping to the genus Branta or any sibling species. It does not include subspecific qualifiers, so child concepts are not implied. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the species."
412154003,Polycarbonate (substance),Polycarbonate recorded as material type,"The phrase records the material type as polycarbonate, clearly denoting the substance without extra qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It corresponds most accurately to Polycarbonate (substance) SCTID 412154003, not to broader classes like Polymer or other plastic siblings, and does not specify a device."
438659007,Specimen from liver obtained by wedge biopsy (specimen),Specimen source: liver; method: wedge biopsy,"This structured statement names the specimen's source (liver) and the acquisition method (wedge biopsy), making it unambiguously a specimen description. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, matching SCTID 438659007 due to the precise combination of source and technique. A broader parent like 'Specimen from liver' is insufficiently detailed, while sibling entries for needle or core biopsy would incorrectly specify the method. The wording is a straightforward synonymic rendering of the preferred concept."
1359986002,Purified water (specimen),Purified water used as the specimen,"The statement indicates that purified water is the material used for the specimen, situating it within the Specimen hierarchy. No mention is made of sterility, a specific purification method, or origin. A broader water specimen parent would omit purification, while siblings (distilled, deionized, sterile water specimens) add characteristics not present. Purified water (specimen), SCTID 1359986002, is thus the exact match."
408397002,Diabetic foot examination not indicated (situation),Diabetic foot examination not necessary.,"The concept is the diabetic foot examination with the attribute 'not necessary,' which is commonly used interchangeably with 'not indicated' in clinical documentation. This fits the SNOMED CT Situation 408397002. Broader parents lack the specific procedure, and siblings such as 'not performed' or 'declined' do not match the meaning. No extra attributes (cause, timing, laterality) are introduced by the phrasing."
45131006,Primary care hospital (environment),Hospital providing primary care,"This phrasing identifies the facility type (hospital) and its functional scope (providing primary care), capturing the environment concept. The category is Environment or geographical location. The wording matches the intent of SCTID 45131006 because it specifies a hospital dedicated to primary care delivery. Parent concepts like 'Healthcare facility' or 'Hospital' are too nonspecific, while sibling concepts focused on secondary or tertiary care, or outpatient clinics, would not be appropriate. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent without introducing timing, severity, or location attributes."
257630004,House (environment),Environmental context: house,"The phrase frames 'house' as the environmental context, mapping directly to House (environment) SCTID 257630004. It avoids attributes like occupancy status, building classification, or associated events. The category is Environment or geographical location. Parent concepts are broader, and siblings such as 'home' or 'apartment' do not match the wording. The paraphrase preserves the same concept and code choice."
261956002,Greek letter mu (qualifier value),section header: mu,"The phrase uses 'mu' as a section header, indicating the Greek letter as a label. The concept is the Greek letter mu, categorized by SNOMED CT as a Qualifier value: 'Greek letter mu (qualifier value)' SCTID 261956002. The labeling context does not imply measurement, prefix, or case. Therefore, mapping to 'Greek letter mu' is exact, while parent 'Greek letter' is too broad and sibling letters do not match the term used."
733501004,"Salmonella II rough:l,z28:z6 (organism)","Salmonella II rough:l,z28:z6 organism","This explicitly labels the entity as an 'organism' and gives the full designation Salmonella II rough:l,z28:z6. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, matching SCTID 733501004. The term 'organism' is a neutral descriptor and does not introduce any clinical finding, specimen, or disease attribute. Parent concepts are overly broad without the specific antigenic profile, and siblings are alternative formulas. Therefore, this entry precisely represents the intended organism."
767562003,Product containing norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (product),Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor product,"This phrasing uses the clinically standard synonym 'serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor' (SNRI) and explicitly states 'product,' keeping the meaning at the medicinal product level. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It conveys the dual reuptake inhibitor mechanism without adding attributes like indication, dose, or formulation, making SCTID 767562003 the most accurate match. Choosing a child concept (a specific SNRI brand or ingredient product) would be too specific, and selecting a sibling such as 'SSRI product' or 'NRI product' would not reflect the dual mechanism."
366128006,Finding of symmetry of chest movement (finding),Chart note references finding of symmetry in chest movement,"This chart note points to a clinical finding about the symmetry attribute of chest movement, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 366128006 under Clinical finding. The statement avoids specifying the outcome, keeping it at the appropriate level of generality and not invoking child concepts. It also does not introduce unrelated attributes like extent or timing, making siblings less appropriate."
11007751000119107,History of right hip disarticulation (situation),Prior right hip disarticulation noted,"The phrase conveys that a right hip disarticulation occurred previously and is noted now as part of the patient’s history. This belongs to the Situation with explicit context category. The exact SNOMED CT concept is ‘History of right hip disarticulation’ (11007751000119107), since it represents historical context with right laterality. A non-lateralized history concept is less specific, and left-sided history would not match. Procedure coding would be inappropriate because the entry is historical, not an active intervention."
284652005,Naval barracks (environment),Documented location: naval barracks,"The substantive concept is “naval barracks,” with “documented location” serving only as a contextual header. SNOMED category: Environment or geographical location. Naval barracks (environment) is the best fit; generic Barracks (environment) would be too broad and “naval base” would be a different entity. The phrase does not add clinical attributes beyond the environment."
432271001,Genus Couchioplanes (organism),Patient statement: “They said it was Couchioplanes.”,"A patient-reported statement names the organism Couchioplanes, with no added clinical details (no infection, site, or timing). The concept is the genus-level organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the most accurate code is Genus Couchioplanes (organism) [432271001]. Mapping to a disorder or exposure concept would be inappropriate since only the organism name is expressed."
227103007,Fried skate in batter (substance),Skate fish battered and fried,"Adding ‘fish’ clarifies the organism (skate) without changing the concept, and ‘battered and fried’ matches the preparation of ‘fried skate in batter.’ The main concept is the particular food substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 227103007 is exact, while parents like ‘skate’ alone lack the batter-fried preparation, and siblings for other seafood or coatings would be incorrect. The phrase remains semantically equivalent and uniquely codable to the given concept."
764527003,Genus Parengyodontium (organism),Parengyodontium fungal taxon (genus),"The term 'fungal taxon (genus)' clarifies that Parengyodontium is being referenced at the genus level within fungi, with no species or clinical attributes included. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This corresponds to SCTID 764527003. Parent fungal taxa are too broad, and child species (e.g., Parengyodontium album) are not indicated. The synonymal phrasing maintains equivalence to the genus concept."
309907008,Cardiac intensive care unit (environment),Service location: cardiac intensive care unit,"This entry marks the service location as the cardiac intensive care unit, clearly an environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps to SCTID 309907008, the specific cardiac ICU environment. A parent concept like Intensive care unit is insufficiently specific, and siblings such as Coronary care unit or Cardiothoracic ICU are not indicated. The phrase 'service location' is contextual and does not change the underlying code selection."
771345002,Product containing triazine derivative (product),Continue triazine derivative-based medication product,"This continuation instruction references the medication product itself as one containing a triazine derivative, aligning with SCTID 771345002. Category: Product. The verb “Continue” is contextual and does not introduce product attributes (no route, dose, strength, or brand). Parent product concepts would miss the chemical class detail, while child concepts naming specific agents or forms are not supported by the wording. The paraphrase “triazine derivative-based” is clinically equivalent to “containing triazine derivative,” so the product concept remains the correct code."
870657008,External lower limb prosthesis powered suspensory component (physical object),Powered suspensory device used in external lower-limb prosthesis,"The phrase denotes a powered device used specifically for suspending an external lower-limb prosthesis, which corresponds to a powered suspensory component in that prosthesis. Category: Physical object. This is the most accurate mapping, as it maintains powered status and suspensory role within an external lower limb prosthesis. It excludes broader devices, non-powered suspension, and components intended for other anatomical regions."
27054007,Cobalt-57 (substance),Cobalt-57 substance,"Including the word 'substance' reinforces that the entry refers to the material cobalt-57 itself. The main concept is cobalt-57 as a Substance. SCTID 27054007 is exact and avoids mapping to parent cobalt or sibling isotopes and stays away from children such as cobalt-57 labeled compounds or commercial products. No additional attributes are present, so the substance concept is the precise match."
405513002,Ilio-profunda artery bypass for repair of aneurysm with prosthesis (procedure),Ilio-profunda bypass procedure employing prosthesis to repair aneurysm,"This entry conveys that the ilio-profunda bypass procedure employs a prosthesis to repair an aneurysm, matching SNOMED CT 405513002. Main concepts: ilio-profunda bypass, prosthesis use, aneurysm repair. Category: Procedure. The wording does not introduce extra attributes and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term. Parent concepts missing indication/device and siblings with different target vessels would be less specific, making this the most precise code selection."
258513007,Prepuce swab (specimen),Prepuce swab received,"This lab receiving note still identifies the specimen type and source as a prepuce swab; the verb “received” is contextual and does not convert the concept to a procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, mapping exactly to Prepuce swab (specimen) [258513007]. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too general or point to different sites (e.g., penile or urethral swabs). No methodological or diagnostic attributes are added, keeping the selection focused on the specific specimen."
223642007,Switzerland (geographic location),Svizzera,"Svizzera is the Italian name for Switzerland, expressing exactly the country and no other details. The concept belongs to the SNOMED CT category of Qualifier value for geographic locations. SCTID 223642007 is the most precise match, whereas parent categories would be too broad and neither child locations within Switzerland nor sibling countries are referenced. The synonym is equivalent and maintains the same concept selection."
697421010000100,Immunoglobulin E antibody to Cichorium intybus (substance),Cichorium intybus IgE (antibody),"The entry explicitly names the antibody type (IgE) and clarifies it is an antibody, with specificity to Cichorium intybus. It is a Substance and maps to Immunoglobulin E antibody to Cichorium intybus (697421010000100). It does not add measurement results or clinical states; hence, observable or disorder concepts are not suitable. The parent generic IgE would be too broad, while allergen extract or allergy disorder would be the wrong semantic type."
289190003,Nasal voice (finding),Perceptual voice assessment: nasal quality present,"A perceptual assessment noting nasal quality present describes the nasal character of the voice without further attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The precise match is Nasal voice (finding) [289190003]. It does not indicate hypernasality or hyponasality and does not suggest other voice disorders, so parent, child, or sibling concepts would be less appropriate."
734404002,Structure of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of left lower limb (body structure),Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (left),"This synonym names the same nerve and includes left laterality, matching the intended anatomical structure. No additional features like pathology or intervention are mentioned, maintaining the Body structure classification. The specification of side makes it inappropriate to use parents lacking laterality or siblings with right or unspecified sides. It also avoids child concepts for branches or segments, supporting the exact structural code."
223913001,Isles of Scilly (geographic location),The Isles of Scilly,"Main concept: the geographic place “The Isles of Scilly,” with a definite article that does not change meaning. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The definite article is a common linguistic variant and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term, so SCTID 223913001 is the correct code. Broader or sibling locations (e.g., Cornwall, United Kingdom) are not stated, nor is any specific island named, avoiding parent or child concepts."
425103009,Genus Alle (organism),Alle (genus designation),"The phrase presents Alle with a genus designation, indicating an Organism concept. It maps to SCTID 425103009 by specifying the genus rank. Broader parent categories or narrower child species would not match the wording. The term 'designation' provides taxonomic context only and does not introduce attributes that would alter code selection."
441906003,Specimen from pelvic structure obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Imaging report addendum: FNA biopsy specimen retrieved from pelvic structure,"The addendum refers to a specimen obtained via FNA biopsy from a pelvic structure. The concept type is Specimen, with attributes site = pelvic structure and method = fine needle aspiration biopsy, aligning with SNOMED CT 441906003. Parent or sibling concepts lacking site or method, or specifying other techniques, would be less precise. The context of an imaging report addendum does not introduce guidance or other attributes; it simply documents the specimen, preserving the exact concept."
226647005,Chocolate cake (substance),Chocolate cake (food substance),"The main concept is chocolate cake, identified as a food substance; the parenthetical clarifier does not change meaning. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This is a direct semantic equivalent of Chocolate cake (substance) 226647005. Broader parents (e.g., generic cake) or different confectionery items would be less precise, and no extra attributes like preparation method or portion are introduced."
396020008,Amidotrizoate (substance),Amidotrizoate noted on imaging report,"The context is an imaging report, but the entry only names amidotrizoate and does not add attributes like route, dosage, salt, or brand. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The best match is 396020008 Amidotrizoate (substance). Coding to a general contrast media parent would be imprecise, and coding to salts (sodium/meglumine) or specific mixtures would be incorrect because those details are not stated; the base substance is the exact concept referenced."
37594009,"Intestinal fluid electrolyte composition, function (observable entity)",Intestinal fluid electrolytes: composition and function,"This entry references the property of intestinal fluid electrolytes, specifically their composition and function, and does not include results or actions. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The phrasing is a safe synonym of the preferred term, directing coding to SCTID 37594009. Broader electrolyte observables would miss the intestinal fluid context; narrower observables (e.g., sodium in intestinal fluid) would add specificity that isn't present. There is no implication of a procedure, making observable entity the correct choice."
765126005,Product containing bile acid (product),Medication reconciliation — product containing bile acid,"In reconciliation context, the clinical entity is a product with bile acid as an ingredient, corresponding to “Product containing bile acid” (SCTID 765126005). No specific bile acid, dose, route, or combination is mentioned, so child concepts are not indicated. Parent categories would be overly broad, and siblings (e.g., bile salt or derivative-containing products) are not supported. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent and precise for coding."
62887003,Sooty tern (organism),Bird species identified as sooty tern,"The main concept is the organism 'sooty tern', described as a bird species. This remains an Organism category concept. SCTID 62887003 is the exact species-level match. The wording 'identified as' provides documentation context without adding clinical attributes that would shift coding away from the organism. Parent concepts like 'Tern (organism)' would be less specific, and sibling species would be incorrect given the explicit species name."
309107007,Tendon specimen (specimen),Lab specimen labeled tendon,"The entry denotes a laboratory specimen with the label indicating tendon origin, which maps to a tendon specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Tendon specimen (309107007) is the most accurate code since the source is clearly tendon, without specifying biopsy or named tendon. Broader parents (e.g., Laboratory specimen) lack tissue specificity, and siblings like specific tendon site specimens are overly detailed. The term 'labeled tendon' clarifies source without adding extraneous attributes."
250533005,Synovial fluid composition (observable entity),Joint fluid composition,"“Joint fluid” is a clinically accepted synonym for synovial fluid, making this an observable for the constituent makeup of synovial fluid. It remains within the Observable entity hierarchy and matches Synovial fluid composition (SCTID 250533005). It avoids introducing specific components, values, or abnormal/normal states, thereby not mapping to narrower siblings (e.g., crystals present) or broader parent categories (e.g., body fluid composition). The synonym does not change the intended concept."
767465003,Tungsten and/or tungsten compound (substance),Tungsten and/or tungsten compound,"The entry explicitly names the substance class comprising elemental tungsten and its chemical compounds. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with a Substance category concept rather than a clinical finding or event. The wording does not restrict to only the element or only compounds, making SCTID 767465003 the most precise match. More specific child concepts like “Tungsten (substance)” or “Tungsten compound (substance)” would be too narrow, and broader parents like “Metal (substance)” would be too coarse. No attributes such as exposure, allergy, dosage, or timing are introduced, so the grouping concept is appropriate."
284864000,Unable to wash own hair (finding),Needs help to wash hair (cannot wash hair by self).,"Having to rely on help indicates inability to perform hair washing independently, matching 'Unable to wash own hair.' This is a Clinical finding and should be coded to SNOMED CT 284864000. The parent concept of overall washing inability is too broad, and siblings covering other grooming actions are not applicable. No additional attributes are introduced, supporting 284864000."
25351000181102,Nocardia casuarinae (organism),Nocardia casuarinae noted by the lab,"The lab context is provided, but the content is solely the species name Nocardia casuarinae. Category: Organism. The best match remains the species-level organism concept; mapping to a finding like ‘detected’ would add an attribute not stated here. Parent genus or sibling species would be inaccurate, and no strain or site details are present."
53680008,"Target arrow, device (physical object)",Device identified as target arrow,"This entry asserts the identification of a device as a target arrow, focusing on the physical object and its specific type. The main concept is the device itself; no usage, material, or modality attributes are added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). SCTID 53680008 is the best fit. Mapping to a parent device group would lose the specificity of 'target arrow,' and mapping to children/siblings with added properties (e.g., radiopaque, adhesive) or different shapes would be incorrect."
242277002,Accidental exposure to pyrethroid insecticide (event),Public health notification: accidental exposure to pyrethroid insecticide.,"Even in a public health reporting context, the coded concept is the Event of accidental exposure to a pyrethroid insecticide. The exact SNOMED CT match is 242277002. Broader exposure concepts without pyrethroid specification or accidental intent, and effect-based diagnoses, are less appropriate since the entry does not include those attributes."
411216009,Fragrance series (product),Stock record: fragrance series,"The central concept is the product ""fragrance series"" documented in stock records; stock status is a non-clinical context. Category is Product in SNOMED CT. SCTID 411216009 accurately represents this series product; mapping to a broader product class or a specific mixture would misinterpret the entry. The phrase avoids mentioning any administration or testing, keeping the code selection focused on the product itself."
224067004,Michigan (geographic location),Location: Michigan,"This entry communicates a location value of Michigan and should be coded to Michigan (geographic location), SCTID 224067004, within the Geographic location category. The context word 'Location' does not introduce any clinical finding or additional attribute; it only labels the place. Using broader parents (country or region) or narrower children (city or county) would not match the text, which explicitly states Michigan as the location without further qualification."
38380006,Eimeria grenieri (organism),Species Eimeria grenieri,"The entry states the species-level taxon, Eimeria grenieri, without adding any clinical or situational attributes. The main concept is an organism in SNOMED CT; category: Organism. The precise match is 38380006 |Eimeria grenieri (organism)|, rather than broader parent taxa (genus Eimeria) or any other Eimeria species (siblings). No infection or presence statement is implied."
413481004,Product containing alpha-4 integrin receptor antagonist (product),Medication product containing alpha-4 integrin receptor antagonist,"This entry identifies a medication product with an alpha-4 integrin receptor antagonist as its active component. It belongs to the SNOMED CT product hierarchy and maps to 413481004. The absence of strength, dose form, brand, or route prevents over-specification. It should not be coded to the substance-only concept because the phrase clearly denotes a product. Parent categories are too broad and child, ingredient-specific concepts are too narrow given the wording."
411690009,Fresh Foeniculum vulgare diagnostic allergen extract (product),Fresh fennel allergen diagnostic reagent,"The entry refers to a diagnostic reagent consisting of a fresh allergen extract from fennel (Foeniculum vulgare). As a Product, it corresponds directly to the Fresh Foeniculum vulgare diagnostic allergen extract concept (SCTID 411690009). The wording avoids any attributes beyond freshness and diagnostic use, so broader or alternate product concepts would be less precise."
16089251000119109,History of ulcer of anus (situation),PMH includes ulcer of anus,"The entry states that the past medical history (PMH) includes an anal ulcer, signifying a previous condition with a precise anatomic site. The main concept is ulcer of the anus with a past history attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. This is best represented by History of ulcer of anus (situation), SCTID 16089251000119109. Coding Ulcer of anus (disorder) would imply an active problem, and broader history categories would be less specific than the site-focused history concept. The PMH context is a conventional synonym for 'history of' and does not alter the code."
396469004,Presence of neoplasm at surgical margin of extrahepatic bile duct in excised specimen of extrahepatic bile duct (observable entity),Tumor at margin of extrahepatic bile duct excision specimen,"This concise statement indicates that a tumor (neoplasm) is present at the margin of an extrahepatic bile duct excision specimen. Concepts: neoplasm presence, surgical margin, extrahepatic bile duct excised specimen. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 396469004 precisely matches the observation. “Tumor” is a synonym for neoplasm and does not imply malignancy or additional attributes. Parent concepts would fail to indicate the site specificity, and sibling concepts dealing with different sites or negative results would not correspond to the entry."
373826004,Surgical excision specimen (specimen),Specimen source: surgical excision,"Declaring the specimen source as surgical excision directly maps to Surgical excision specimen (specimen), SCTID 373826004. No extraneous attributes are present. The category is Specimen. Using a parent like Specimen would lose the technique detail, and choosing a sibling such as Aspiration specimen or Curettage specimen would be inaccurate because those imply different procedures."
110920009,Tracheal cytologic material (specimen),Tracheal cytopathology specimen,"“Cytopathology” is a commonly used synonym for cytology in the context of specimens; this denotes a cytopathology specimen from the trachea. It falls under the Specimen category and maps to 110920009. Parent concepts without site are too general, and child terms introduce collection methods not stated. The synonym does not change the underlying concept, ensuring precise coding."
223645009,Armenia (geographic location),Country of Armenia,"‘Country of Armenia’ is a phrasing that still refers to the sovereign national entity, i.e., the country Armenia, without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. It is the precise match for SCTID 223645009 and avoids mapping to broader geographic categories or sibling/child localities. The wording is equivalent and maintains the same code selection."
22201008,Free-standing dental clinic (environment),Follow-up at the freestanding dental clinic,"Despite the encounter context, the central coded element is the environment named as a freestanding dental clinic, synonymous with free-standing. This maps to SNOMED CT 22201008 (Environment). The wording explicitly excludes hospital-based clinics and is narrower than the parent dental clinic concept. No other attributes beyond the environmental setting are introduced."
702921003,Sexual health clinic (environment),Recorded service environment: sexual health clinic,"The recorded environment for service is a sexual health clinic, indicating the physical setting. This belongs to the Environment hierarchy and maps to Sexual health clinic (environment) SCTID 702921003. The phrasing does not imply an organizational unit or specific procedure; it focuses on location. More generic clinic environments are not as specific as needed."
89458003,Stupor (finding),ED triage note: stupor,"This ED triage documentation explicitly identifies stupor, a Clinical finding of impaired consciousness. It maps to Stupor (finding), SCTID 89458003. The triage context does not introduce cause, severity, or time modifiers affecting code choice. Parent concepts like 'altered mental status' are less precise, and sibling terms for other consciousness levels do not align with the explicit 'stupor'."
26711000181105,Virgibacillus sediminis (organism),Entry: Virgibacillus sediminis,"The core concept is the organism species Virgibacillus sediminis, with 'Entry' functioning as a contextual label that does not change semantic content. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It correlates exactly with SCTID 26711000181105 and does not invoke any clinical findings or disorders. Parent concepts (genus or broader bacteria) would be less specific, and child strain concepts are not indicated. The label is administrative, not clinical, and thus retains organism-only meaning."
466663001,"X-ray film duplicator, diagnostic imaging (physical object)",Patient asked about the X-ray film duplicator device,"This patient statement names the device explicitly, keeping the focus on the physical object: an X-ray film duplicator. Category: Physical object (Device). SCTID 466663001 is the precise match. A parent code for general imaging devices would be nonspecific, and selecting a sibling device with different functionality would be incorrect. The phrasing is a direct reference and doesn’t introduce extra attributes or procedural meaning."
216376003,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, rifle range (environment)",Site of occurrence: rifle range,"This phrase captures the site where the accident or poisoning occurred as a rifle range, without extra attributes like timing, cause, or outcome. It aligns with the Environment or geographical location hierarchy and maps exactly to SNOMED CT 'Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, rifle range (environment)' (216376003). Parent concepts are too general, and no sibling environment is implied."
421252009,North Dakota (geographic location),State of North Dakota,"By explicitly calling it a state, the text still refers to the singular geographic location North Dakota. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The wording does not introduce administrative structures or organizations; it remains a place name. Coding to a parent concept (USA) would be less precise, and coding to any subregion (e.g., Bismarck) or sibling state would be incorrect. The phrase is a clinically safe synonym for the same location, so North Dakota (geographic location) SCTID 421252009 is the best match."
7860005,Stillbirth of mature male (2500 gms. or more) (finding),Male stillbirth with birth weight ≥2.5 kg,"The entry explicitly conveys stillbirth, male sex, and a weight threshold of ≥2.5 kg, matching the maturity criterion. The primary concept is stillbirth of a mature male, classified as a Clinical finding. SCTID 7860005 is exact since it specifies male and ≥2500 g; a parent stillbirth concept without these details would be less precise, and a sibling for immature male stillbirth (<2500 g) would not match. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not introduce new attributes."
1365669004,History of victim of adult domestic physical abuse (situation),History: victim of adult domestic physical abuse,"A succinct history label indicating the patient was previously a victim of adult domestic physical abuse. Category: Situation. It matches 1365669004 because it captures the historical context and the specific adult domestic physical abuse victimization. More general terms lacking the physical or adult qualifier, or concepts indicating current victim status, would not fit the wording. 'History' is the standard explicit context term and does not add extra attributes."
276476002,Inhalation or ingestion of food (event),Clinical summary: food intake by inhalation or ingestion,"The clinical summary notes a food intake event, specifying the route could be inhalation or ingestion. This belongs to the Event category and matches SCTID 276476002. The term avoids narrowing to a single route and does not imply outcomes like aspiration, so sibling disorder codes are not appropriate. The summary context does not add attributes that would change the coding."
468673007,"Douche, electric (physical object)",Inventory: electric douche,"Inventory context still denotes the same physical object without changing its nature. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Douche, electric (physical object) [468673007] remains the most appropriate code; mapping to supply or procurement processes would be incorrect because the entry names the device itself."
11424001,Ambulance-based care (environment),Care context listed as ambulance,"The entry specifies the care context (environment) as an ambulance, without adding timing, diagnosis, or procedural details. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 11424001 precisely captures ambulance-based care. A broader parent like Care context (environment) would be too generic, and sibling contexts (clinic, ED) would not match. There is no implication of transport or service organizations, so it avoids mapping to ambulance transport or EMS. The term ‘care context’ is a documentation synonym that keeps the meaning within environment semantics and does not change code selection."
229541004,Foot strapping (procedure),Strapping treatment to foot,"Main concept: treatment by strapping of the foot. No laterality, cause, or timing is introduced. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The phrasing indicates the same intervention as foot strapping; “treatment” does not alter the procedural nature. Parent codes for generic strapping are not site-specific, children with laterality/subsite add details not provided, and siblings for other regions are anatomically incorrect. The best code is “Foot strapping (procedure)” 229541004."
51563005,Free-standing mental health clinic (environment),Standalone mental health clinic,"“Standalone” is a clinically accepted synonym for “free-standing,” indicating a mental health clinic not integrated with a hospital. The main concept is the independent mental health clinic environment. Category: Environment. This maps specifically to “Free-standing mental health clinic (environment)” (SCTID 51563005) because it conveys independence without adding outpatient, residential, or community qualifiers. More general parents like “Mental health clinic (environment)” do not capture the standalone attribute, and siblings such as hospital-based mental health clinics or mental health centers would misrepresent the facility type."
724453005,Problem of prostate (finding),Patient reports a problem with his prostate.,"This is a patient-reported statement indicating a non-specific problem of the prostate, categorized as a Clinical finding. The appropriate code is SNOMED CT 724453005 Problem of prostate (finding). It does not add timing, severity, or etiologic detail, so child concepts are not justified. A disorder mapping would be inappropriate because the wording does not assert a diagnosed disease entity; it simply notes a problem involving the prostate."
223613004,Oman (geographic location),Oman (sovereign state),"Describing Oman as a 'sovereign state' identifies the country-level geographic entity, equivalent to the concept of Oman as a location. Main concept: Oman, country. SNOMED CT category: Location. This is directly aligned with SCTID 223613004 and does not introduce other contextual attributes. It avoids broader parents (e.g., Middle East) and narrower children (e.g., Muscat)."
422520007,Cathartes burrovianus (organism),C. burrovianus,"This is the standard abbreviated binomial for Cathartes burrovianus, where the genus Cathartes is abbreviated to “C.” and the species epithet is specified. It unambiguously refers to the same species and maps to the SNOMED CT Organism concept SCTID 422520007. Using the abbreviation does not shift to a parent genus or another species; it remains a precise synonym for the organism name without adding context or attributes."
248436008,Slightly remittent fever (finding),Assessment: slight remittent fever,"This assessment labels the fever as slightly remittent, meaning minor remissions without return to normal temperature. It is a Clinical finding. The exact SNOMED CT match is 248436008 (Slightly remittent fever), because the degree of remittance is specified. Using the parent ""Remittent fever"" would lose the slight qualifier, and sibling concepts like intermittent or undulating fever describe different patterns. The statement keeps to the pattern and degree only, avoiding added attributes such as duration, severity of temperature, or etiological factors."
1208815007,Aortic endovascular stent graft (physical object),Endovascular aortic stent-graft device,"Main concept: physical device; an endovascular stent-graft for the aorta. Attributes: device type and aortic use. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The wording is device-centric and matches 1208815007 exactly, avoiding procedural language or regional qualifiers like thoracic/abdominal. A parent like 'endovascular stent-graft device' would be too broad, and siblings such as 'aortic stent without graft' would be incorrect because 'stent-graft' is specified."
63921000119108,Family history of Rett syndrome (situation),Charted family history of Rett syndrome.,"This indicates the family history of Rett syndrome is charted/documented. The concept is a situation of family history pertaining to a specific disorder. It belongs to Situation with explicit context, mapped to SCTID 63921000119108. It avoids introducing additional details, and coding the disorder itself or a generalized family history would be less precise."
218081007,Accident caused by firearm missile (event),Reported accidental firearm round impact,"The entry documents a reported accidental impact from a firearm round, i.e., a projectile. Category: Event. It maps to SCTID 218081007 because it captures both the accidental nature and the firearm missile cause. 'Round' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'bullet' or firearm projectile, not changing code selection. Parent categories are too general, while intentional siblings are ruled out by 'accidental.' There is no mention of firearm type, injury site, or timing, avoiding child concept selection."
242796004,Exposure to ionizing radiation from cosmic sources (event),Encounter diagnosis: exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation,"The statement frames the same exposure event as an encounter diagnosis without adding attributes beyond identifying the event. SNOMED CT category: Event. It retains the essential elements—ionizing radiation and cosmic origin—making it more specific than the parent concept of general ionizing radiation exposure and excluding siblings like medical X-ray exposure. The diagnostic context does not change the underlying event concept, so 242796004 remains the correct code."
720378001,Patient advised medication may affect driving (situation),Nursing note: patient advised medication may affect driving.,"This entry shows nursing documentation that the patient was advised about medication possibly affecting driving. The SNOMED category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 720378001 precisely encodes that advice was provided linking medication to driving effects. General nursing education codes are less specific, and prohibitory driving advice would be an overstatement. The note’s setting is contextual only and does not introduce new clinical attributes."
260228005,Spondee (physical object),Speech material—spondee,"This denotes the speech material item as a spondee, the equal-stress bisyllabic word used in audiology. It is a Physical object, and Spondee (physical object) [260228005] is the most precise code. The contextual marker “speech material” does not add modality or procedural attributes, so mapping to parent concepts would be too general and to child concepts too specific. The entry remains uniquely tied to the spondee object."
223542004,Mozambique (geographic location),Mozambique (Portuguese: Moçambique),"Providing the Portuguese synonym clarifies linguistic variants while still denoting the same country. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and the precise mapping is Mozambique (geographic location) SCTID 223542004. The synonym does not alter the concept or imply administrative differences. Parents are too general; children (e.g., provinces) are not specified."
302546000,Entire great toe (body structure),Whole of the great toe,This phrase indicates the full anatomical extent of the great toe. Category: Body structure. It corresponds to 302546000 by expressing the complete digit without laterality or subdivisions. Sibling/child concepts that introduce side or segment would be inappropriate given the wording.
418608002,Intracorneal route (qualifier value),Use intracorneal route only,"The directive restricts administration to the intracorneal route, specifying delivery into the cornea. This precisely maps to SNOMED CT 418608002 Intracorneal route (qualifier value). No procedural or substance details are provided, so it remains a route qualifier and avoids procedure concepts. Parent route categories are too broad, and sibling ocular routes (such as subconjunctival or intravitreal) differ anatomically. The wording emphasizes exclusivity but does not alter the concept."
35325003,Alosa estivalis (organism),Species: Alosa estivalis,"This entry explicitly labels the organism as a species and names it as Alosa estivalis, without any added qualifiers. The main concept is the species-level organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The precise code is Alosa estivalis (SCTID 35325003). Genus-level (Alosa) or broader fish classifications would be too general, and other Alosa species would be incorrect. Because this is a straightforward species designation, it does not imply any condition or event."
447339001,Nasal smear specimen (specimen),Slide-based specimen: nasal smear,"This identifies a slide-based smear specimen from the nose, which is exactly a nasal smear specimen and maps to Nasal smear specimen (specimen), SCTID 447339001. Main concept: nasal smear prepared on a slide. Category: Specimen. Noting the slide format is inherent to smears and does not change the specimen’s identity. It differentiates from swabs, washes, aspirates, and non-nasal sites, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate than the nasal smear specimen code."
1155710001,G2: Well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm (qualifier value),G2: Well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm,"The entry explicitly states the grading qualifier 'G2' for a well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm, which matches the SNOMED CT qualifier value concept 1155710001. The main concept is the grade of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm; no site, stage, Ki-67, mitotic rate, or other attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. Parent concepts such as generic tumor grade are too broad, and sibling grades (G1 or G3) would be incorrect. The wording here is a direct match to the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
223406005,Tahiti (geographic location),Geographical location recorded: Tahiti,"This documents the geographic location as Tahiti without asserting residence, travel, or timing. The recording context is metadata and does not alter the core concept. It maps to Tahiti (geographic location), SCTID 223406005. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Parent categories are too broad, and no alternative locations are referenced. The wording is equivalent and preserves the same code."
257425005,Bright field microscopy technique (qualifier value),Bright-field microscopy modality,"The use of 'modality' here signifies the technique configuration and explicitly states bright-field microscopy, keeping the focus on the method. The concept is a Qualifier value, and SCTID 257425005 is the correct code. It is more specific than unspecific microscopy modality (parent) and does not infer sibling modalities such as dark field or fluorescence. 'Modality' in microscopy is clinically synonymous with technique and does not add extra attributes."
258436001,Umbilical cord tissue specimen (specimen),Umbilical cord tissue (specimen),"The parenthetical clarifies that the reference is to a specimen, and the substance is umbilical cord tissue. The medical concept is a Specimen. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Umbilical cord tissue specimen (258436001). The term does not imply blood, placenta, or a specific substructure, preventing misclassification to siblings or child concepts. It is more specific than a general Umbilical cord specimen, which could include blood or other materials."
258009005,Boyden chamber technique (qualifier value),Historical documentation—Boyden chamber technique,"This entry indicates historical documentation of the Boyden chamber technique, keeping the focus on the method qualifier while adding only a historical context. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, aligning precisely with SCTID 258009005. A parent technique code would lack specificity, and any procedure/test mapping would be incorrect because the text names only the technique. The wording is a contextual paraphrase that preserves the same conceptual meaning."
223382005,Hong Kong (geographic location),Current location: Hong Kong,"The entry conveys present location context, but the codable concept named is the place Hong Kong. SNOMED CT category: Location. Hong Kong (geographic location) SCTID 223382005 best fits because it directly represents the named place without introducing subregions or broader geographies. Parent/child/sibling concepts would misrepresent specificity. The temporal context (‘current’) does not add attributes that change the location concept."
1204494009,Niue (geographic location),Niue (geographic location),"This wording uses the fully specified name format, explicitly identifying Niue as a geographic location, which fits the SNOMED CT category Location. It adds no contextual attributes like residency or travel status; it simply denotes the place concept. Thus, Niue (geographic location) [1204494009] is exact. A parent concept such as Geographic location would be less specific, and any child concept (e.g., Alofi) or sibling (e.g., other Pacific locations) would be inaccurate given the specific term Niue."
223625001,New Zealand (geographic location),"Place documented as ""New Zealand""","Although framed as documentation context, the only codable concept presented is the place name “New Zealand.” This aligns with the Environment or geographical location category and corresponds to New Zealand (geographic location) [223625001]. No attributes such as travel, residence, or sublocation are added. Parent generic place concepts would be too broad; child/sibling places are not mentioned. Thus, 223625001 is the precise code."
444461004,Exposure to lymphogranuloma venereum (event),Triage note: exposure to lymphogranuloma venereum,"This entry records exposure to lymphogranuloma venereum within triage documentation; the context does not alter the exposure event. It maps to the SNOMED CT Event Exposure to lymphogranuloma venereum (event) SCTID 444461004. The wording avoids implying infection, symptoms, or adding attributes like route or severity. Choosing a broader parent exposure code would lose specificity, and using sibling concepts for other pathogens would be incorrect. The disease-specific exposure is clear and unambiguous."
228486009,Time since stopped smoking (observable entity),Time since smoking cessation,"This phrasing uses the clinically standard synonym 'smoking cessation' for 'stopped smoking' and refers to the time elapsed since that event, aligning exactly with SNOMED CT 228486009. Main concept: temporal interval from cessation. Category: Observable entity. It is more precise for this code than sibling concepts such as Date of smoking cessation (which captures a calendar date) or Ex-smoker (status) because the focus here is the duration since quitting. The synonym does not introduce new attributes and remains semantically equivalent."
443501000124106,Pediatric high energy formula with increased fiber (product),"Pediatric high-energy, high-fiber formula","The phrase indicates a pediatric formula that is both high-energy (high calorie) and high-fiber (increased fiber). Category: Product. This directly matches SCTID 443501000124106, capturing both required attributes. A parent like 'Pediatric formula' would lack specificity, and siblings including only high energy or only increased fiber miss a stated attribute. No extra route, brand, or preparation details are implied."
443591000124104,Modular lipid formula component (product),Lipid modular component in formula,"The entry describes a modular component within a formula dedicated to lipid provision, identifying a product role. The main concept is the lipid module as part of formula composition. SNOMED CT category: Product. It exactly matches Modular lipid formula component since it reflects the modular, lipid-focused nature of the component. Parent concepts that do not indicate lipid are too general; siblings for other nutrients are incorrect; naming the lipid type or brand would create child mappings not supported by this wording."
71950006,Theobroma cacao (organism),Botanical specimen: Theobroma cacao,"The entry labels a botanical specimen by the species Theobroma cacao, which corresponds directly to the organism concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 71950006 is exact for this species designation. Using a parent genus or general plant organism would be nonspecific, and using a sibling species would misclassify the specimen. No part or product is mentioned, so the organism species code is the appropriate selection."
242744002,Accident caused by industrial sewing machine (event),ED triage note: industrial sewing machine accident,"This triage entry indicates an accidental event with an industrial sewing machine as the cause. It does not add injury specifics, timing beyond the context of triage, or location attributes. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is the Event 'Accident caused by industrial sewing machine' (242744002). Broader accident categories or domestic sewing machine variants would not reflect the specified device."
224028005,Labrador (geographic location),Region: Labrador,"Use of 'Region' is a general descriptor indicating a place area, here clearly the geographic region named Labrador. Category: Geographic location (Location). It does not specify administrative boundaries or alternate entities, so the base concept Labrador (224028005) fits best. It would be less appropriate to code a country or the province 'Newfoundland and Labrador,' which is not stated."
414635003,Macrococcus brunensis (organism),M. brunensis,"This entry uses the standard genus initial abbreviation with the species epithet, referring to the organism Macrococcus brunensis. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The combination of “M.” with “brunensis” unambiguously denotes Macrococcus brunensis in clinical microbiology nomenclature, without adding any clinical attributes. A parent genus code for Macrococcus would be overly general, and any sibling species names would not match brunensis. Therefore, 414635003 Macrococcus brunensis (organism) is the most precise match for this abbreviated species designation."
866180008,Provision of wearable defibrillation system (procedure),Wearable defibrillation system dispensed,"Dispensed is a clinically safe synonym for provided/issued in the device context, and the object—a wearable defibrillation system—matches the intended device. This is the provision procedure, aligning with SNOMED CT 866180008 (Procedure). More specific actions like fitting or configuring are not stated, and broader parents like generic device dispensing lack the specificity of a wearable defibrillation device, making the given concept the most precise."
298701009,Simulated rotation test negative (finding),Simulated rotation test negative confirmed,"This wording affirms the negative outcome of the simulated rotation test, which remains a result-based Clinical finding. It maps to SNOMED CT 298701009. No added attributes like timing or severity are present. Parent concepts are too general, while the positive sibling and procedure concepts would be incorrect for a confirmed negative result."
103342007,Mid-longitudinal (qualifier value),Use mid-longitudinal orientation,"This is an instruction to use a 'mid-longitudinal' orientation, which directly invokes the orientation qualifier. The category is Qualifier value, and the exact code is SNOMED CT 103342007 Mid-longitudinal (qualifier value). Siblings like 'longitudinal,' 'midline,' 'transverse,' or 'oblique' do not convey the combined mid-centered longitudinal meaning. The imperative phrasing does not add clinical attributes and remains focused on the qualifier."
242935006,Assault by gagging (event),Assault — gagging,"A concise registry-style entry pairing the assault with gagging as the mechanism. Category: Event. It maps to SNOMED CT Assault by gagging (event), SCTID 242935006, given that gagging is explicitly linked to the assault. The brevity avoids adding attributes, preventing misclassification to parent Assault (event) or sibling mechanisms. The hyphenated format is a documentation style and remains equivalent to the preferred term."
282846006,Difficulty moving within a position (finding),Difficulty moving once in a position,"The phrase indicates that after assuming a position, movement within that position is difficult, without introducing cause or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This maps to 282846006, which captures movement difficulty confined to a held posture. Sibling concepts for changing position or maintaining a position are not suggested here, and parent concepts are too general. The paraphrase maintains identical clinical meaning."
3244000,Biomphalaria tenagophila (organism),Biomphalaria tenagophila: species name,"This entry presents the species name Biomphalaria tenagophila and does not introduce any additional attributes, timing, or associations. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It is the exact organism concept, making SCTID 3244000 the most precise code and excluding parent genus or sibling species mappings."
430214008,Specimen from lower limb (specimen),Lower extremity origin sample,"This entry states a sample (specimen) originating from the lower extremity, synonymous with lower limb. The concept is a Specimen with a defined source site and maps to SCTID 430214008. No extra attributes (type, method, laterality, substructure) are present, keeping it distinct from child or sibling concepts and more specific than a general limb-source specimen."
120808003,Antibody to Human echovirus 30 (substance),Catalog item: anti‑echovirus 30 antibody,"As a catalog designation, the text still names the underlying substance—an antibody to echovirus type 30. The concept fits the SNOMED CT Substance hierarchy. It does not suggest a test order, positivity, method, or isotype. Hence, it maps to 'Antibody to Human echovirus 30 (substance)'. Broader antibody substances or test procedures are not appropriate given the specificity and lack of procedural attributes."
1279969008,Nutrition clinic (environment),Clinical nutrition clinic,"The concept is a nutrition clinic as a care environment, expressed with the synonym 'clinical nutrition clinic.' The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This maps to Nutrition clinic (environment), SCTID 1279969008, because 'clinical' here simply reinforces that the clinic provides healthcare services in nutrition; it does not introduce new attributes such as subpopulation or care level. Parent concepts like Clinic (environment) are too nonspecific, and siblings that add qualifiers (e.g., pediatric nutrition clinic) do not match this phrasing. The synonym is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
178194005,Structure of parotid fascia (body structure),Structure of parotid fascia,"This entry uses the preferred term, directly denoting the anatomical entity and nothing else. It is a Body structure and corresponds precisely to SCTID 178194005. Parent concepts (e.g., parotid gland as a whole) are too general, and child or sibling entities like capsule or duct are different structures. The wording contains no clinical findings or modifiers, so this is the exact match."
305887001,Seen by dental surgery service (finding),Case seen by the dental surgery service,"The documentation notes that the case was seen by the dental surgery service, indicating the Clinical finding of service contact. This maps to SCTID 305887001. The entry avoids timing, reasons, or procedural terms. A parent like 'Seen by clinical service' is nonspecific, and siblings (e.g., oral/maxillofacial or non-surgical dental services) would not match the specified 'dental surgery service.' The 'case seen' phrasing is a standard synonym that does not change coding intent."
1204397001,Product containing silver and/or silver compound (product),Silver-based pharmaceutical product,"The phrase 'silver-based' identifies the product’s ingredient basis as silver, which encompasses elemental silver or silver compounds, with no additional attributes like route or strength. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). This aligns best with SCTID 1204397001 since it refers to the ingredient-level class rather than a specific clinical drug or compound. Choosing a child concept such as 'silver nitrate product' or 'silver sulfadiazine product' would be inappropriate because those specify particular compounds not indicated by the entry."
245917008,Structure of sacral region of anterior longitudinal ligament (body structure),Sacral segment of the anterior longitudinal ligament,"The wording identifies the ALL and its sacral segment, matching the sacral region structure concept (245917008). Category: Body structure. ""Segment"" here is a clinically safe synonym for a regional portion of the ligament and does not change the code selection. Parent concepts (entire ALL) are too broad, and children specifying S1/S2 would be too granular; siblings like posterior longitudinal ligament are different structures."
469242009,Intraocular gas cylinder regulator (physical object),Intraocular gas cylinder regulator sent to biomed for calibration,"This indicates the same regulator was sent for calibration, but the device itself is an intraocular gas cylinder regulator. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). The wording still maps most precisely to 469242009 because it specifies intraocular cylinder use, avoiding broader regulator categories. Calibration is maintenance context, not an attribute that alters coding."
215447005,Submersion and drowning due to jumping from burning ship (event),Submersion and drowning following jump off burning ship.,"The entry states submersion and drowning after a jump off a burning ship. Main concepts: submersion, drowning; attributes: mechanism (jump off), vessel (ship), condition (burning). SNOMED CT category: Event. This is a direct restatement of SCTID 215447005. Parents without cause/context or siblings with altered mechanism or non-burning ship would be less precise. The synonym 'jump off' is equivalent to 'jump from' and does not modify the coded attributes."
285729008,Genus Spirostreptus (organism),Record label: Spirostreptus genus (organism),The record label specifies the organism name and rank: Spirostreptus genus. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The most precise mapping is Genus Spirostreptus (organism). It neither broadens to higher taxa nor narrows to a particular species and introduces no clinical attributes. The phrase is a direct synonym with explicit organism context.
772157000,Scarlet fever suspected (situation),R/O scarlet fever,"In clinical shorthand, 'R/O' (rule out) indicates the condition is suspected and being evaluated; it does not mean the condition is already excluded. The main concept is suspected scarlet fever. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s Situation with explicit context. It should not be mapped to 'ruled out' concepts unless explicitly documented as excluded, and it is not a confirmed diagnosis. Therefore, this wording appropriately maps to Scarlet fever suspected (situation), reflecting ongoing suspicion without added attributes."
217976003,Accident caused by band saw (event),Accident with band saw,"The phrase communicates an accident and identifies a band saw as the involved device, which is the defining causal mechanism. It is an Event and exactly matches SCTID 217976003. No extraneous attributes such as body part, severity, place, or time are included. Parent concepts lacking device specificity or siblings for other saw types are less appropriate. The prepositional form “with band saw” is a clinically acceptable equivalent to “caused by band saw.”"
223544003,Angola (geographic location),"Angola, Africa","This identifies Angola and situates it within the continent for clarity, but the codable concept remains the country Angola itself. No new attributes beyond the place name are asserted. Category: Location—Geographic location. SNOMED CT 223544003 is most precise. Parent geographic location is too general; children (e.g., Cabinda Province) or siblings (other African countries) would not fit."
119324002,Specimen of unknown material (specimen),Laboratory note: specimen material unspecified,"The phrasing indicates a specimen for which the material is unspecified (i.e., unknown), fitting SNOMED CT 119324002. Main concept: specimen; attribute: material unspecified/unknown. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. Using “unspecified” is a clinically equivalent synonym to “unknown” in this coding context. More general parent concepts omit this qualifier, and children with defined materials do not apply because material is not identified."
217959002,Accident caused by lift (event),Unintentional accident due to elevator,The entry states an unintentional accident with the elevator as cause. Category: Event. 'Unintentional' is inherent to 'accident' and does not add a new attribute beyond the event classification. The elevator mechanism makes 217959002 the most precise match; more generic or other mechanism concepts are excluded.
871553007,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen (observable entity),Measurable entity: SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection,"This phrasing designates the measurable entity as detection of SARS‑CoV‑2 antigen, with no additional attributes such as method, specimen, or result. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 871553007 is the appropriate code. Choosing parents would reduce specificity, and siblings (e.g., RNA detection, antibody detection, or antigen quantitation) would represent different observables. It does not imply a performed procedure or a clinical finding of presence/absence, keeping it correctly at the observable level. The wording is a contextual label that doesn’t alter coding."
1149042002,Histologic grade of primary malignant neoplasm of lung (observable entity),Pathology report item: histologic grade of primary lung cancer,"This context specifies that the observable being reported in pathology is the histologic grade for a primary lung cancer. The main medical concept is the histologic grade attribute tied to a primary malignant lung tumor, without stating the grade value. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and the most precise code is 1149042002. A generic 'histologic grade' parent would not capture the site and primary status; a sibling for lung malignancy without 'primary' would be less specific; and child concepts with particular histologic subtypes or grades would not fit this general attribute. The report context does not alter the observed property."
10682431000119105,Mass of subcutaneous tissue of left lower limb (finding),Subdermal mass in the left lower limb,"This Clinical finding uses “subdermal” to denote the subcutaneous layer beneath the dermis, and it specifies the left lower limb. “Mass” is the core phenomenon; the attributes include tissue layer (subdermal/subcutaneous), region (lower limb), and laterality (left). This corresponds precisely to SNOMED CT 10682431000119105. Parent concepts would fail to include laterality or region. Child concepts that identify specific segments like left leg or left foot are not stated and would be too granular. Sibling concepts such as cutaneous mass or a nonspecific soft tissue mass are not appropriate because the layer is clearly subcutaneous."
467092005,Wire clip (physical object),Found object: wire clip,"The statement identifies the found object as a wire clip. The main concept is a wire clip as a physical object; contextual verbs do not add attributes that change the concept. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 467092005 matches exactly. Parent or sibling concepts (generic clip, cable clip, surgical clip) would not be as accurate. The 'found' context does not introduce a different codeable entity."
371903004,Medication administered during percutaneous coronary intervention (situation),Drug therapy administered during the PCI procedure.,"The statement indicates drug therapy (synonymous with medication administration) occurred during PCI. The main concept is medication administration timed to the PCI, aligning with a Situation in SNOMED. SCTID 371903004 precisely matches this intra-procedural administration. A general medication administration concept misses the procedural context, and specifying particular drug classes or alternate timing would miscode. “Drug therapy” here is a neutral synonym and does not add attributes beyond administration."
1237451006,International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework - Regular Level 7 (qualifier value),Diet texture: IDDSI Regular Level 7,"This entry indicates the diet texture using the IDDSI specification “Regular Level 7,” which aligns precisely with SCTID 1237451006. The concept is a diet texture qualifier within the IDDSI framework, categorized as a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT. It does not add unrelated attributes such as timing or severity. More general parents (e.g., unspecified IDDSI level) are too broad, and siblings like Level 7 Easy to Chew or Level 6 Soft & Bite-Sized do not match the explicit “Regular” wording. The phrase is an accepted synonymical framing of the same IDDSI level."
223810004,Munster (geographic location),"Travel history: Munster, Ireland","The codable concept is Munster in Ireland as a Geographic location. The phrase 'Travel history' supplies context but doesn’t alter the identity of the place. Therefore, SNOMED CT Location concept SCTID 223810004 is the correct mapping. Parent concepts (Ireland) are overly broad, and child/sibling locations (counties, other provinces, or Münster in Germany) are not specified by the text."
314656002,Child head circumference equal to 91st centile (finding),Pediatric exam: head circumference equal to 91st centile.,A pediatric exam finding of head circumference equal to the 91st centile is clearly a Clinical finding in a child. This matches SNOMED CT 314656002 exactly. The term 'centile' is an acceptable synonym for 'percentile' and does not change the meaning. Parent concepts that generalize percentile findings or sibling concepts at other percentiles/ranges would be less precise. No additional attributes are included.
223804004,Limerick (geographic location),Service provided in Limerick,"The wording places the provision of service in Limerick, with the principal concept being the geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223804004 is the correct, specific code for the named place. Parent concepts are too broad, and children/siblings such as county or facility names are not indicated. The context of service provision does not change the coded entity; it continues to be the location Limerick."
223808001,Meath (geographic location),Site locality: Meath (county),"This records the site’s locality as Meath at the county level. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The term “locality” is contextual and non-anatomical here; it denotes the geographic entity Meath, corresponding to SCTID 223808001. Broader parent regions or alternative counties would be incorrect, and no finer-grained child locality is specified."
411745005,Pandalus borealis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Northern shrimp diagnostic allergen extract (Pandalus borealis),The entry combines common and scientific names to specify the species and identifies the product as a diagnostic allergen extract. Category: Product. It avoids procedural phrasing and therapeutic context. More general shrimp extract concepts would be siblings and insufficiently specific; parent concepts without species are too broad. The synonyms used are equivalent and maintain the same concept.
115494003,Immunosuppressive acidic protein (substance),Immunosuppressive acidic protein listed in the laboratory catalog,"This sentence references the substance immunosuppressive acidic protein in a catalog context, but still denotes only the named biochemical entity without invoking measurement or results. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 115494003 is the precise match, while broader parent concepts would fail to capture the exact named protein. Sibling procedure or observable concepts are less appropriate since the wording does not order, perform, or interpret a test; it simply references the substance. The catalog context does not alter the concept—it remains the substance."
1002255009,Genus Paraeggerthella (organism),Clinician note: Paraeggerthella (genus),"This clinician documentation cites Paraeggerthella and clarifies it as a genus. It introduces no site, infection, or other attributes. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 1002255009 fits exactly. A parent organism group would be overly general, and child species would be too specific and not referenced in the text. Therefore, the genus-level organism concept is correct."
224691007,Lounge (environment),Scene: lounge,"“Scene” labels the environmental scene as a lounge. Category: Environment or geographical location (environment). The best match is Lounge (environment) 224691007. Generic parents like Room (environment) are less precise, and specific siblings (waiting room, lobby) are not suggested. The entry is purely locational, without added clinical attributes."
411821001,Cladosporium herbarum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Cladosporium herbarum diagnostic allergen test reagent,This phrasing identifies the product as a test reagent for diagnostic allergy evaluation and specifies Cladosporium herbarum. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). 'Test reagent' is a common synonym in labs for diagnostic extracts and does not add dosing or route details. It avoids mapping to procedure concepts and remains distinct from therapeutic allergen extract siblings.
45711004,Retropubic approach (qualifier value),Access via retropubic space,"This entry describes access through the retropubic space (space of Retzius), which is the definition of a retropubic approach. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and code 45711004 is exact. It avoids attributes like procedure details, timing, or technology. A generic parent approach concept would be underspecified, while other approaches (e.g., preperitoneal) are not stated. 'Retropubic space' is a clinically accepted synonym for this approach."
175135009,Introduction of cardiac pacemaker system via vein (procedure),Pacemaker system inserted via venous access,"The main concept is insertion of a pacemaker system (cardiac pacemaker device plus leads) using venous access, which is a Procedure. 'Via venous access' is synonymous with 'via vein/transvenous', directly mapping to SCTID 175135009. It avoids added details like device configuration, permanence, or named vein, preventing misclassification to child concepts. Sibling concepts involving epicardial or surgical placements are excluded by the venous route, and broader parent concepts lacking route specificity are less appropriate."
257595003,Derelict factory (environment),Location: disused factory,"This documents the environmental location specifically as a disused (derelict) factory, which fits Derelict factory (environment), SCTID 257595003, categorized as Environment. The “Location” label is contextual, not an added clinical attribute. Using “disused” remains semantically equivalent to derelict. Parent and sibling concepts are either too general (Derelict building) or not derelict (Factory environment)."
65171000119107,History of secondary lens implant (situation),Chart notes: history of secondary lens implantation,"By referencing chart notes and stating 'history of' tied to 'secondary lens implantation,' the entry documents a prior secondary IOL procedure. This fits the Situation with explicit context category. It precisely matches History of secondary lens implant, not a general history of IOL implantation. It avoids confusion with the active procedure concept and with findings like pseudophakia, which are not the focus of the historical context."
25000009,Salmonella Bassa (organism),Salmonella enterica serovar Bassa,"This expands the taxonomic name, identifying the Salmonella enterica serovar Bassa, which is clinically synonymous with Salmonella Bassa. Main concept: the organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The specific code 25000009 for Salmonella Bassa remains the most precise match; parent concepts like Salmonella enterica (without serovar) are too general. No strain or disease context is introduced."
365772005,Finding of serum alkaline phosphatase level (finding),Clinic message references your serum alkaline phosphatase level,"The message references the patient's serum alkaline phosphatase level as a finding, with no interpretation or procedural context. This is a Clinical finding. SCTID 365772005 is the most accurate code because it denotes a finding of the serum ALP level. It does not imply a measurement procedure, and it avoids abnormal qualifiers that would lead to child concepts. No sibling concepts (e.g., isoenzyme fractions or non-serum specimens) are suggested."
702840008,Chronic pain clinic (environment),Chronic pain clinic environment,"This entry states the environment explicitly and qualifies the clinic focus as chronic pain. Main concept: healthcare environment/site. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It precisely matches 'Chronic pain clinic (environment)' because the defining feature is a clinic designated for chronic pain. Parent concepts like 'Healthcare facility' or 'Clinic (environment)' are too general, and siblings such as 'Pain clinic (environment)' lack the chronic qualifier. No other attributes are present."
423604004,Structure of lymphatic vessel of axilla (body structure),Dissection anatomy: lymphatic vessel of the axilla,"This entry describes the anatomical focus during dissection: a lymphatic vessel in the axilla. It remains within the Body structure hierarchy and is best represented by Structure of lymphatic vessel of axilla. No laterality or pathology is introduced. The term is not broadened to nodes or other axillary tissues, so parent or sibling concepts are less precise than SCTID 423604004."
185920002,Cardiovascular clinic (environment),Cardiovascular clinic facility,"Adding 'facility' reiterates that the environment is a clinic dedicated to cardiovascular care, which is equivalent to the cardiovascular clinic concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location; SCTID 185920002 fits precisely. Generic facility or clinic codes would be less specific, and subspecialty clinics are not implied. 'Facility' is a descriptor of environment and does not add other attributes."
309132009,Prostate biopsy specimen (specimen),Clinic documentation: prostate biopsy specimen,"This line indicates that the clinic documentation refers to a prostate biopsy specimen, emphasizing the type of material. The concept is a Specimen and corresponds to SNOMED CT 309132009. General parents lack either site or biopsy specificity, and method-specific children are not applicable. The contextual wording remains semantically equivalent and precisely identifies the specimen."
245079004,Structure of tendon of back (body structure),Documented site: tendon of back,"The entry records the site as the tendon of the back, with no extra attributes such as laterality, subregion, or pathology. This belongs to the Body structure category and maps precisely to SCTID 245079004. Using a parent concept would omit the back location, and a child concept would introduce specificity not present. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
224042002,Arkansas (geographic location),Location: Arkansas,"This entry records Arkansas as the location, with no added information about events, residency, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It corresponds to Arkansas (geographic location) SCTID 224042002 because the place being referenced is the state itself. A broader parent such as United States would not be as exact, and children/siblings like Little Rock or Missouri would be incorrect. The context word ""Location"" does not alter the concept; it only indicates the data field, preserving the same code."
276052003,Public facilities (environment),Environment recorded as public facilities,"The entry documents the environment with the label 'public facilities,' and it does not introduce any additional attributes. This aligns with the Environment category and maps to SNOMED CT 276052003. Broader environment descriptors are overly general, and narrower facility-specific terms are not supported by the phrasing."
223606004,Bahrain (geographic location),Study location: Bahrain,"The entry uses a diagnostic or research report context to state that the location is Bahrain. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. It maps to SCTID 223606004 because the only coded concept is the country Bahrain. No event, travel, or residency attribute is asserted; the label 'study location' is a contextual field name. A parent like Geographic location lacks specificity, and child or sibling location concepts are not invoked."
283894000,Ability to remember day of the week (observable entity),Follow-up item: ability to remember day of the week,"This designates a follow-up documentation item targeting the observable 'ability to remember day-of-week.' It does not add a result, severity, or broader orientation attribute, thus remaining within the Observable entity category. The wording is a contextually framed synonym and supports exact mapping to SCTID 283894000 rather than to parent or sibling concepts."
734380008,Specimen from surgical wound (specimen),Specimen from surgical wound,"The statement denotes a specimen whose source is a surgical wound, identifying the material as a SNOMED CT Specimen category item. This exactly matches “Specimen from surgical wound (specimen),” which captures the origin without specifying specimen type, location, laterality, or purpose. More generic parents like “Specimen from wound” are too broad, and children such as “Swab from surgical wound specimen” are too specific. No sibling wound types (e.g., traumatic) are implied."
224511004,Support for informal caregiver (observable entity),Follow-up: informal caregiver support,"The phrase presents the observable topic at follow-up without adding attributes or implying interventions. The concept is the Observable entity 'Support for informal caregiver' (224511004). It does not state presence/absence, sufficiency, or provision, so child/sibling concepts (e.g., lack of support, training provided) are not suggested. It remains more precise than generic caregiver support by specifying informal caregivers."
223557006,Ghana (geographic location),The geographic location specified is Ghana,"This narrative statement identifies Ghana as the specified geographic location, aligning exactly with the concept. The main concept is Ghana. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (environment). No additional attributes such as visit or residence are present. A generic parent concept would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts do not match. The wording is a paraphrase that preserves semantic equivalence and code selection."
223738004,Laccadive islands (geographic location),Laccadives,"“Laccadives” is a commonly used short-form synonym for the Laccadive Islands and denotes the same island group. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This wording still targets the exact geographic entity intended by Laccadive islands (geographic location), making it the best match. It does not imply a broader area like Lakshadweep or a single island, avoiding parent or child misclassification. The synonym does not introduce additional attributes and thus remains an equivalent mapping."
262490001,Ruparupae (qualifier value),Ruparupae,"The entry is the exact preferred term for SNOMED CT concept 262490001 and denotes a Qualifier value category item. No additional attributes such as severity, timing, laterality, site, or causation are introduced. Therefore, the most precise match is Ruparupae (qualifier value) rather than any parent like “Qualifier value (qualifier value)” or siblings such as “Present,” “Absent,” or “Normal.” The wording directly represents the coded value and does not suggest a disorder or clinical finding."
185785000,Stress monitoring deleted (finding),Care log shows stress monitoring deleted,"The statement reflects that the care log indicates deletion of stress monitoring, which is a Clinical finding about record status. It precisely corresponds to 'Stress monitoring deleted (finding)'. It does not entail any performance or cancellation details; therefore, parent general deletion or sibling 'canceled'/'stopped' concepts do not better match the wording."
466126009,Sequential venous compression system pump (physical object),SCD pump,"SCD is a common clinical abbreviation for sequential compression device; adding “pump” explicitly identifies the pump unit, which matches the sequential venous compression system pump. SNOMED CT category: Physical object—Device. This synonym is widely used in clinical settings to denote the pump component, not the sleeves or full system. Parent concepts like generic pumps are too broad, and siblings such as sleeves/garments are not implied. No procedural action is stated, keeping the focus on the physical object."
277747008,Structure of low superior vena cava (body structure),Low segment of the superior vena cava,"This entry clearly identifies a segmental subdivision of the SVC and specifies the low (inferior) segment. It is purely anatomical, belonging to the Body structure category. The specificity matches SCTID 277747008 for the low SVC segment, whereas the general SVC structure concept is too broad. No disease, laterality, or junctional detail is introduced, avoiding misclassification to sibling concepts. 'Segment' helps clarify substructure without altering the intended anatomical target."
261904005,Laboratory (environment),Encounter context: laboratory environment,"The phrase states that the encounter took place within a laboratory environment in general terms, without adding timing or event details. The main concept is environmental setting. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It fits Laboratory (environment) and avoids mapping to service/procedure concepts or departments. Parent environments are too broad, and siblings like operating room or ward are not indicated."
391822003,Benserazide hydrochloride (substance),Benserazide hydrochloride noted in materials list,"A materials listing context while remaining focused solely on the substance identity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the best match Benserazide hydrochloride (391822003). No product formulation, dose, or observation status is included, and the salt specification ensures it is not mapped to benserazide base or product siblings."
25299008,Abnormal excretory function (finding),Functional abnormality of excretion,"This entry explicitly characterizes a functional abnormality related to excretion, which is a Clinical finding. It aligns directly with SNOMED CT 25299008 Abnormal excretory function (finding), since it refers to the excretory function rather than structural anomalies or disorders. More general parents do not capture the excretory focus, and system-specific children (renal, biliary, pulmonary CO2 excretion) are not supported by the text. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent paraphrase without added attributes."
444494001,Exposure to infectious disease from arthropod (event),Exposure to arthropod-transmitted infectious disease.,"The core concept is exposure to an infectious disease transmitted by an arthropod vector. No diagnosis, species, or timing attributes are stated. This maps to the SNOMED CT Event 'Exposure to infectious disease from arthropod (event)' 444494001. The term 'arthropod-transmitted' is a direct synonym of 'from arthropod'; parent concepts are too broad and any child naming a specific arthropod would be too narrow for this wording."
51347003,Incest (event),Incest (event),"The phrase reproduces the SNOMED CT preferred term with its semantic tag, explicitly indicating this is classified as an Event. It identifies the occurrence of incest without modifiers such as suspected, history, or contextual qualifiers like perpetrator or age. Parent concepts like sexual behavior (event) are overly general, while child or sibling concepts (e.g., rape, sexual assault, incest involving a specific relative) imply attributes not given here. The wording is a direct, unambiguous representation of the concept 51347003, Incest (event), and does not shift the coding toward a Situation, Finding, or Disorder category."
279350000,Entire cingulate sulcus (body structure),Whole cingulate sulcus,"Using “whole” as a synonym for “entire” clarifies that the complete cingulate sulcus is referenced, which is a Body structure and corresponds to SNOMED CT 279350000. No laterality, segment, or abnormality is introduced, so it should not be mapped to left/right or anterior/posterior sulci, nor to broader parent structures."
870572003,Cryopreservation of spermatozoa (procedure),Discharge summary: sperm freezing done,"This documents that the procedure of sperm freezing (cryopreservation of spermatozoa) was done. Category: Procedure. ‘Sperm freezing’ is a clinically equivalent synonym for cryopreservation of spermatozoa, mapping to SCTID 870572003. Parent generic cryopreservation would be less specific, and sibling concepts (semen or oocyte cryopreservation) are not indicated. No additional attributes are added beyond confirmation of performance."
1186896004,Entire anatomical variant (body structure),"Anatomical variant, whole structure","The entry identifies an anatomical variant as a body structure with an explicit whole-structure qualifier. There are no added attributes beyond wholeness. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, with the most precise match being Entire anatomical variant (body structure) [1186896004]. The unqualified Anatomical variant (body structure) would be less specific, and mapping to a Clinical finding is inappropriate because the phrase refers to the structure itself rather than an observed condition. “Whole structure” is semantically equivalent to “entire,” preserving code selection."
