sct_id,label,entry,reasoning
420716000,Phylum Echiura (organism),Echiura (phylum),"This phrasing identifies Echiura and clarifies its rank as a phylum, indicating the organism taxon rather than a particular species or genus. SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the correct code is Phylum Echiura (420716000). Parent concepts like broader animal phyla or kingdom would not be as precise, and child concepts representing specific echiuran taxa would be overly specific. The term is a direct synonym that does not add clinical attributes, keeping the mapping limited to the phylum."
256375003,Whole blood - irradiated (product),Irradiated whole blood component,"Here, 'component' is a common blood bank synonym for blood product types and refers to the same product: whole blood that has been irradiated. It is within the Product hierarchy. The entry does not add attributes like leukoreduction, CMV status, pediatric use, or any procedural action, ensuring it aligns with SCTID 256375003. Using 'component' does not change the concept; it remains a clinically equivalent expression distinct from non-irradiated whole blood or other irradiated components."
290066009,Breast pigmented (finding),Breast shows pigmentation,"This statement denotes the breast exhibits pigmentation, a straightforward clinical finding. No added attributes (e.g., degree, cause, specific substructure, or lesion type) are present. It matches the Clinical finding concept SNOMED CT 290066009 “Breast pigmented (finding)”. Using terms like pigmented lesion or nipple pigmentation would introduce specificity not stated. The wording is a direct synonym and justifies selecting the same code."
444623009,Machine hemodialysate specimen obtained before mixing (specimen),Unmixed machine hemodialysate specimen,"The term 'unmixed' is a clinically accepted paraphrase of 'before mixing' in the context of dialysis fluid preparation. The core concept is a Specimen of hemodialysate from the machine prior to mixing. SCTID 444623009 is the most precise match, since it encodes the pre-mixing state. Parent concepts lacking the mixing qualifier are less specific, and any sibling indicating 'after mixing' would not align with 'unmixed.' No additional qualifiers (e.g., volume, contamination, additives) are introduced."
448491004,Intrajejunal route (qualifier value),Route specified: intrajejunal,"Here the specified route is intrajejunal, which aligns exactly with SNOMED CT’s Intrajejunal route (Qualifier value 448491004). General routes (enteral) or other segment-specific routes (intragastric/intraileal) would be less accurate. No additional qualifiers such as device, dose, or timing are included, supporting selection of the route qualifier."
418862001,Pediatric infectious diseases (qualifier value),Clinical specialty: pediatric infectious diseases,"The phrase explicitly frames 'pediatric infectious diseases' as a clinical specialty, which aligns with a Qualifier value rather than a disorder, occupation, or service. This fits SCTID 418862001 as it denotes the pediatric infectious diseases specialty. Mapping to a parent like 'Clinical specialty' alone would lose specificity, and mapping to disorder concepts would be incorrect because no disease or patient condition is described. The added 'Clinical specialty:' is contextual labeling and does not introduce new attributes beyond identifying the qualifier."
411704002,Humulus lupus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract—Humulus lupulus,"By stating “Diagnostic allergen extract” and then specifying Humulus lupulus, this entry describes the exact product used for diagnostic allergy evaluation to hops. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This best matches concept 411704002, the Humulus lupulus diagnostic allergen extract. A more generic parent concept would lack the specified allergen source, and siblings such as immunotherapy products or substance-level allergens would not reflect the diagnostic product formulation indicated here. The hyphenated presentation is a stylistic variation that does not alter the meaning or introduce new attributes."
64585003,High frequency electromagnetic radiation (physical force),High-frequency EM spectrum radiation,"The phrase identifies radiation within the high-frequency segment of the electromagnetic spectrum, still denoting the same physical force. It belongs to the Physical force hierarchy and should be mapped to High frequency electromagnetic radiation (physical force) SCTID 64585003. Broader concepts like Electromagnetic radiation do not capture the frequency detail, and narrower children (microwave, radiofrequency, ultraviolet) are not specified. The terminology is equivalent and does not add attributes such as cause or exposure."
730120005,Entire popliteal ligament (body structure),Popliteal ligament of the knee,"The phrase identifies the popliteal ligament and situates it anatomically at the knee, which is consistent with its normal anatomical location without adding new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. Entire popliteal ligament (body structure) [730120005] is the precise match. Selecting a parent such as knee region structure or knee ligament would be too broad, and selecting children like oblique or arcuate popliteal ligament would add specificity not present in the entry."
359949007,Incision of aortic arch (procedure),Arch of aorta surgically incised,"This entry documents that the arch of the aorta was surgically incised, aligning with SNOMED CT concept 359949007. The main concept is the incision and the anatomical site is the aortic arch; no extra details are included. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This selection is more precise than parent concepts and excludes sibling concepts like repair or incisions of other aortic parts. The wording is a synonymous paraphrase and does not introduce new attributes."
224629001,Retreat house (environment),Seen at a retreat house,"This situational note indicates the encounter location as a retreat house, aligning with the environmental concept. Category: Environment or geographical location. It does not imply healthcare facility status or other attributes that would shift coding to clinic or hospital. The specificity to retreat house avoids mapping to generic house or sibling venues, supporting SCTID 224629001."
62970001,Osmolarity (observable entity),Osmolarity parameter,"Describing osmolarity as a parameter indicates the observable property being referenced without adding specimen or interpretation. This maps to Osmolarity (observable entity) SCTID 62970001. It is not a procedure or test order, nor does it imply osmolality or osmotic pressure, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate. The term 'parameter' does not change the underlying property being coded."
1204493003,Macao (geographic location),Place name: Macao,"The phrase identifies a toponym, with “Macao” as the sole named place. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value – Geographic location. It correctly maps to Macao (geographic location), SCTID 1204493003, and excludes attributes that would invoke other concepts (e.g., residence, birth, or travel). It avoids implying related but different locales, so parent and sibling concepts are less suitable."
425113001,Asio otus wilsonianus (organism),Recorded organism name: Asio otus wilsonianus,"This records the organism’s name as Asio otus wilsonianus, the subspecies. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact scientific designation matches SCTID 425113001, not the parent species or genus. The context of recording does not change or add attributes; it remains a straightforward taxonomic identification."
364365000,Obstetric pelvic observable (observable entity),Obstetric pelvis observable,"This phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym using 'pelvis' instead of 'pelvic' but conveys the same concept: an observable entity about the obstetric pelvis. Category: Observable entity. It precisely fits the SNOMED CT concept since it identifies the parameter/variable applicable to the obstetric pelvis without adding a specific measure, result, or procedure. Parent concepts lacking either the obstetric context or the pelvic focus are too broad, and child concepts for specific pelvic measurements or dimensions would be too narrow; the entry remains generic and correctly aligned to the given concept."
704522001,Libyan sign language (qualifier value),Libyan Sign Language,"Main concept: 'Libyan Sign Language' with capitalization variation only. No added attributes such as 'primary' or 'preferred'. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The phrase is a stylistic variant of the preferred term and maps precisely to SCTID 704522001. Broader parent terms (e.g., 'Sign language') would lose specificity, and other sign languages are inappropriate. This capitalization difference is clinically equivalent and does not alter the meaning."
406528008,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome clinical trial group (social concept),Social group: AIDS clinical trial group,"The entry explicitly frames the concept as a social group and specifies that it is the AIDS clinical trial group. SNOMED CT category: Social concept. This matches SCTID 406528008 because it identifies the precise social grouping for an AIDS clinical trial. It does not introduce treatment arm, timing, or severity, thereby avoiding child/sibling mappings."
387098001,Lithium citrate (substance),Patient states the name “lithium citrate”,"A patient-reported mention of the name identifies the substance lithium citrate but adds no attributes such as dose or product form. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and 387098001 is the exact code. Coding to therapy or product concepts would be less precise given the absence of administration or formulation details; parent and sibling salts are incorrect."
85896002,Avulsion of greater occipital nerve (procedure),Procedure: avulsion of greater occipital nerve,"The entry uses a structured procedure label followed by the exact procedure, which is avulsion of the greater occipital nerve. This fits the SNOMED CT Procedure category and precisely maps to 85896002. Parent concepts lack the necessary anatomical specificity, and siblings with different techniques (e.g., excision/neurectomy, block) are not implied by the wording. No additional attributes are present; the statement conveys only the target nerve and the avulsion technique."
721966001,Pathology order (record artifact),Pathology order documented,"The entry conveys that an order to pathology has been documented, focusing on the record artifact. It maps to SNOMED CT 721966001 Pathology order (record artifact), under the Record artifact category. No added attributes like test subtype, urgency, or patient condition are present, so parent or sibling concepts would be less accurate, and child concepts overly specific."
707563002,Immunoglobulin A antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi (substance),Counseling note: discussed the Borrelia burgdorferi-specific IgA antibody,"The documentation context does not alter the substance being referred to: an IgA antibody specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, which is SCTID 707563002 under Substance. No presence, titer, or diagnostic outcome is stated, so it avoids mapping to findings or procedures. The specificity and isotype are clear, making broader or sibling isotype concepts less appropriate."
411800001,Blatella germanica diagnostic allergen extract (product),German cockroach diagnostic allergen extract,"This text identifies a diagnostic allergen extract directed at the German cockroach allergen, which corresponds to a product for allergy testing. In SNOMED CT, it matches the Product concept SCTID 411800001 for Blatella/Blattella germanica diagnostic allergen extract. Using the common name “German cockroach” is clinically equivalent to the scientific name and does not change the code selection. Broader parent concepts omit the species, and immunotherapy or other-species extracts would be incorrect given the explicit diagnostic context and species."
701830008,Antisnoring mucosa lubricant (physical object),Antisnoring mucosal lubricant used by patient,"Main concept: antisnoring mucosal lubricant; 'used by patient' is contextual and does not introduce timing, dosage, site, or formulation. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. 701830008 is the precise match as it encodes this specific product type. Broader anti-snoring aids or general lubricants would lose specificity, while child concepts specifying anatomical site or formulation would add details not stated in the entry."
870489008,Product containing serotonin receptor agonist (product),Serotonin receptor agonist–containing pharmaceutical,"This expression identifies a pharmaceutical product characterized by containing a serotonin receptor agonist. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Product, and the exact code match is “Product containing serotonin receptor agonist (product)” (SCTID: 870489008). The wording focuses on the product composition rather than the substance in isolation, avoiding misclassification as a Substance concept. It does not specify any particular agent or subtype, thereby not mapping more precisely to child concepts, and avoids broader parents lacking the serotonin receptor agonist attribute."
786862007,Structure of arterial supply to and/or within uterus (body structure),Arterial vasculature of the uterus,"This statement names the uterine arterial network as an anatomical structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It matches SCTID 786862007 by specifying arteries associated with the uterus, encompassing supply to and within the organ. Broader parents (e.g., uterine vasculature including veins) and narrower children (e.g., specific uterine artery segments) are less appropriate. The phrasing is a safe, semantically equivalent synonym without new attributes."
708245001,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Enterococcus faecium (substance),E. faecium deoxyribonucleic acid,"This phrase specifies the DNA of Enterococcus faecium using an accepted abbreviation for the organism, without introducing any result, method, or role. It belongs to the Substance hierarchy. The SNOMED concept 708245001 is exact, avoiding overly broad parents (e.g., Enterococcus DNA) and excluding siblings for other species. No subtyping (e.g., genomic vs plasmid) is implied, so the parent or child concepts would be less precise or too narrow."
1352598003,Union for International Cancer Control rpN1b (qualifier value),Tumor board staging entry: UICC rpN1b,"The phrase documents the tumor board’s staging entry as UICC rpN1b, denoting recurrent pathological N1b. This is a qualifier in the TNM staging system, so the SNOMED CT type is Qualifier value, with the precise concept being 1352598003. Parent or sibling qualifiers (rpN1, rpN1a/rpN1c, pN1b/cN1b) do not reflect the exact rpN1b descriptor indicated."
82259005,Erythrophleum (organism),Erythrophleum—genus-level organism,"Explicitly stating “genus-level organism” ensures the intended taxonomic rank is genus, which aligns perfectly with Erythrophleum (organism) in the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy. No child species or broader taxa are implied, and there are no clinical modifiers. Hence, the genus concept [82259005] is the correct and most granular match."
773516009,Head injury rehabilitation care plan (record artifact),Head injury rehabilitation care plan noted,"The entry acknowledges the existence of a care plan for head injury rehabilitation, framing it as a record artifact. Main concept: care plan document; attributes: head injury, rehabilitation. Category: Record artifact. Code 773516009 is appropriate because this is not an intervention or a generic plan; it is specific to rehabilitation for head injury. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings involving other conditions or non-rehabilitation care plans are less accurate. 'Noted' reflects documentation status without shifting to a procedure concept."
216417004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, bus station (environment)",Event location (accident or poisoning): bus station,"The entry labels the event as an accident or poisoning and specifies the location as a bus station, with no other attributes. The main concept is the place-of-occurrence for accident/poisoning at a bus station. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This aligns exactly with SCTID 216417004. Choosing a parent concept would be less specific, and choosing a sibling like 'bus stop' would misrepresent the location. The term 'event location' is a neutral paraphrase that preserves the original meaning."
151011000119104,Poliomyelitis vaccination given (situation),Polio inoculation given,"“Inoculation” is a clinically acceptable synonym for vaccination and indicates that the polio vaccine has been given. The concept recorded is the given status of poliomyelitis vaccination, with no specification of dose, formulation, route, or timing. Category: Situation with explicit context. The precise SNOMED code is 151011000119104; a parent like “Inoculation given” is too generic and a child/sibling specifying IPV/OPV or non-given status would not match. The synonym conveys the same clinical situation."
96230006,Xylazine hydrochloride (substance),Xylazine·HCl,"The dot notation is a standard chemical shorthand indicating the hydrochloride salt form, making this a synonym for xylazine hydrochloride. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; the correct code is Xylazine hydrochloride (substance), SCTID 96230006. The entry does not imply product formulation or clinical administration, so product concepts are not suitable. Using xylazine (substance) would disregard the salt form and be less accurate."
19923001,"Catheter, device (physical object)",Clinic inventory includes: catheter device,"An inventory note referencing a catheter device as an item, identifying it as a physical object. Category: Physical object (Device). The precise match is Catheter, device (19923001). No details suggest a specific subtype (urinary, venous, arterial) or any procedural association, ruling out child or sibling codes."
396912009,Stage IVa: Pleural or pericardial dissemination (thymus gland) (finding),Summary: Stage IVa of thymus gland with pleural or pericardial dissemination,"This summary entry clearly documents thymus gland Stage IVa and pleural or pericardial dissemination, which corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 396912009 (Clinical finding). It avoids introducing any additional attributes beyond those intrinsic to the stage definition. Parent or sibling staging concepts would either be too general or incorrect (e.g., IVb). The use of 'with' and 'dissemination' are standard clinical phrasing and remain semantically equivalent to the preferred term for accurate coding."
470329004,Laparoscopic gas distention system (physical object),Laparoscopic gas distention system,"The main concept is a device used in laparoscopy to insufflate gas and create space, referred to here exactly as a laparoscopic gas distention system. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). This wording matches SCTID 470329004 precisely, as it specifies the laparoscopic context and the function (gas distention) without adding attributes like gas type, flow rate, or integrated features. More general parent devices (e.g., generic insufflation systems) or sibling devices (e.g., endoscopic insufflators not restricted to laparoscopy) are less precise. No child concept is implied because no additional specifications are introduced."
217269002,Accident due to collapse of burning tenement (event),Documented accident due to collapse of burning tenement,"The statement documents an accident caused by the collapse of a tenement that was burning. It is an Event and corresponds exactly to SCTID 217269002. No added attributes such as injury outcomes, occupants, or timing are present. General parent concepts related to building collapse or fire without tenement designation would be too broad, and siblings specifying different structures would be misaligned with the explicit tenement reference."
1263471008,Entire soft tissue of thumb (body structure),Whole pollex soft tissues,"This entry uses 'whole' to assert totality and 'pollex' as a synonym for thumb, with 'soft tissues' denoting all non-bony tissues. It introduces no extra clinical attributes. It is a Body structure concept and is most accurately coded as SCTID 1263471008 (Entire soft tissue of thumb). Parent concepts like soft tissue of finger are too general, and siblings referencing other digits would be incorrect. Children specifying laterality or particular thumb segments are not implied, hence the 'entire' soft tissue concept is exact."
134188003,Statement of special educational needs (record artifact),Parent reports a Statement of Special Educational Needs,"The parent indicates the existence of the formal Statement of Special Educational Needs document. The main concept is the record artifact, appropriately coded to SNOMED CT SCTID 134188003. Choosing a clinical finding or education plan sibling would be incorrect, as this entry refers to the document itself. The patient-reported context does not add clinical severity or timing; it confirms the artifact."
6736007,Moderate (severity modifier) (qualifier value),Moderate (severity modifier).,"The wording reproduces the qualifier context for moderate severity without any linked disorder or finding, making the main concept a severity-level modifier alone. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The best code is Moderate (severity modifier) (6736007). Parent classes for severity or children/siblings like 'Mild severity' or 'Severe severity' are not appropriate because the text clearly indicates the moderate level. The phrase is identical in meaning to the preferred term and fits the intended use as a severity qualifier."
223854005,Islands in region of France (geographic location),Place: islands in region of France,"The entry designates the place as islands in a region of France, with a neutral label. Category: Geographic location. It fits SCTID 223854005, not broader geographic parents or siblings like Islands in France, and it is not a singular island child. The label “Place” is generic and does not introduce person-related or event-related attributes; the core concept remains the regional islands of France."
223569003,The Gambia (geographic location),Birth country: The Gambia,"The value specifies the country, The Gambia, as a location, in a birth-related demographic field. Main concept: The Gambia (geographic country). SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The correct mapping is SCTID 223569003 for the country itself; parent regional concepts or child localities are not appropriate, and nationality/citizenship findings are different concepts. The context 'Birth country' does not change the coded value; it remains the geographic location."
398234006,Breathing system problem (event),Breathing system issue,"This entry documents an issue affecting the breathing system without describing a specific failure mode or adding attributes like severity or temporality. The main concept is an equipment/system event. SNOMED CT category: Event. It maps to Breathing system problem (event), SCTID 398234006, where “issue” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “problem.” It avoids specificity that would point to children (e.g., misconnection, obstruction) and is more precise than generic event/problem parents."
218125003,Accident caused by explosion of munitions dump (event),External cause: accident caused by munitions dump explosion,"This entry explicitly records the external cause as an accident due to a munitions dump explosion, aligning with SNOMED CT Event 218125003. The label “External cause” is contextual and does not alter the core concept. More general explosion accident codes are less precise, and sibling concepts involving different explosive sources are not applicable. No extra attributes such as timing, injury specifics, or workplace context are added."
702220009,Heart ventricle partitioning implant (physical object),Chart device entry: heart ventricle partitioning implant,"The text records a device entry in the chart and explicitly names the object as a heart ventricle partitioning implant. The main concept is the physical object with no extra attributes such as presence finding, laterality, or procedural details. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). SCTID 702220009 matches this device exactly. Mapping to a presence finding or implantation procedure would be inappropriate because the entry is naming the device type, not an event or status. Parents are too broad and siblings too specific or anatomically different."
700546003,Electrical logic circuit meter (physical object),Device issued: electrical logic circuit meter,"The statement indicates issuance of a specific device, an electrical logic circuit meter, without introducing qualities beyond the object identity. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 700546003 is the precise code because it denotes the exact meter type. Generic parents such as 'meter (device)' are too broad, and siblings like 'logic probe' or 'oscilloscope' reflect different testing tools. The administrative context ('issued') does not affect the concept mapping."
469082005,Dentine adhesive (physical object),Operatory material: dentin adhesive,"In operatory context, dentin adhesive is identified as a material, pointing to the physical object. This maps precisely to SNOMED CT 469082005. The substrate specificity avoids broader adhesive concepts (parent) and different-substrate adhesives (siblings). There is no mention of particular adhesive systems or primers, so child concepts are not implied. The wording introduces no clinical attributes; it is an item designation."
736373009,End of life care plan (record artifact),Patient states they have an end-of-life care plan,"This patient-reported entry references a plan-of-care document specifically for end-of-life, fitting the Record artifact category. The most precise code is End of life care plan (record artifact) [736373009]. Broader care plan parents are insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts like 'Advance care directive' or 'Do not resuscitate order' differ in type and scope. The wording remains equivalent in meaning without adding attributes."
723357000,Chapman reflex treatment method (procedure),Applied Chapman reflex technique,"This documentation phrase indicates the Chapman reflex technique was applied, with no mention of site, intensity, timing, or associated conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the correct code is Chapman reflex treatment method (procedure) [723357000]. Coding to a parent OMT concept would lack specificity, and other techniques (HVLA, counterstrain) do not match the wording. 'Technique' is synonymous with the treatment method in this context and does not change code selection."
239653004,Application of skeletal traction via the metacarpals (procedure),Bedside procedure: metacarpal skeletal traction applied.,"The entry indicates that skeletal traction was applied via the metacarpals, performed at the bedside. It remains a Procedure and matches SCTID 239653004 due to the explicit skeletal traction type and metacarpal route. The bedside context does not introduce new attributes that change coding. Parent concepts that omit the site are less specific, and sibling concepts for other bones or skin traction are inappropriate given the metacarpal skeletal route."
309145008,Thyroid fluid specimen (specimen),Report notes specimen is thyroid fluid,"The concept is a report statement identifying the specimen as thyroid fluid; attributes include specimen type (fluid) and source (thyroid). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This directly corresponds to 309145008 because it specifies fluid from the thyroid as the specimen, without procedural or pathologic qualifiers. Parent terms lacking either attribute are less precise, and siblings such as “Thyroid aspirate” suggest method not present here. The reporting context does not change the underlying specimen concept, maintaining the correct code."
361978008,Entire anterior basal segment of right lower lobe of lung (body structure),Airway segment: anterior basal of right lower lobe,"Describing it as an airway segment emphasizes the bronchopulmonary segment level and specifies the anterior basal segment within the right lower lobe. It is a Body structure. The best match is the entire anterior basal segment of RLL because it targets that specific segment, making parent lobe structures or sibling segments inappropriate. The term “airway segment” is a clinically acceptable synonym for bronchopulmonary segment and does not change coding."
1288042006,History of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of kidney (situation),Documented history of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the kidney.,"The phrase ""documented history"" establishes the situation context rather than a present disorder. The entry specifies both the site (kidney) and differentiation (well-differentiated), which are essential for SCTID 1288042006. It does not introduce other attributes such as stage, laterality, or treatment. Parent concepts lacking differentiation or site are broader and less appropriate, and sibling concepts (e.g., history of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of kidney) would not align with ""well-differentiated."""
1370860003,Entire secondary carina between anterior segmental bronchus and lingular segmental bronchus of left upper lobe (body structure),Left upper lobe secondary carina located between the anterior segmental bronchus and the lingular segmental bronchus.,"This entry defines the secondary carina in the LUL and specifies it is between the anterior segmental bronchus and the lingular segmental bronchus, with no further attributes. It is a Body structure. SCTID 1370860003 is the exact match because it captures the entire carina at that location. A parent concept like 'secondary carina of LUL' would not identify the specific branches; sibling concepts would indicate other branch pairs. The phrasing remains within the same anatomical scope."
1002249004,Product containing recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (product),Documentation tag: product that contains recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid,"A documentation tag is merely contextual; the concept is a product that contains recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid. Category: Product. No additional attributes like route, dose, brand, or therapeutic use are implied, preventing a shift to child medicinal products or procedures. It is distinct from parent 'Product' and aligns exactly with SCTID 1002249004."
21989003,Structure of quadriceps femoris muscle (body structure),Structure of quadriceps femoris muscle,"This phrasing mirrors the SNOMED CT preferred term and directly denotes the anatomical entity as a Body structure under 21989003. It avoids any clinical findings, procedures, laterality, or functional attributes. Parent concepts (e.g., generic thigh muscle structure) are too broad, while child concepts (individual component muscles of the quadriceps) are too narrow. Sibling concepts (e.g., quadriceps tendon structure) are distinct tissues and not referenced here. Therefore, the exact concept and code are most appropriate."
268527000,Repeat prescription treatment changed (situation),Repeat prescription treatment amended,‘Amended’ is a clinically safe synonym for ‘changed’ and refers to the repeat prescription treatment. The core concept is modification of an existing repeat prescription. No new attributes are included. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 268527000 precisely matches the situation of a change to repeat prescription treatment; alternatives like general treatment change or specific actions (start/stop) do not align with the neutral change wording used here.
68219007,Structure of lobe of breast (body structure),Structural lobe of the breast,"By specifying 'structural lobe,' the entry clearly targets the anatomical lobe of the breast, mapping to SNOMED CT 68219007 (Body structure). No additional attributes are present. It is not the whole breast (parent) nor a lobule or duct (child/siblings). This formulation is a clinically safe paraphrase of the preferred term without altering the code."
414321005,Genus Beijerinckia (organism),Microbial genus recorded: Beijerinckia,"This indicates that the recorded microbial genus is Beijerinckia, a pure taxonomic statement. Category: Organism. The best match is Genus Beijerinckia (414321005). Parent concepts would be too general, and child species would be over-specific. The recording context does not assert detection, disease, or other attributes, so the organism genus concept remains the correct code."
305061000,Structure of articular cartilage of lateral femoral condyle (body structure),Follow-up note: articular cartilage of lateral femoral condyle,"A follow-up documentation context is used, but the entry strictly names the anatomical structure without adding findings or interventions. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches SCTID 305061000 precisely by identifying articular cartilage at the lateral femoral condyle. Parent concepts are too generic, and sibling concepts addressing the medial condyle do not align with the stated lateral site."
285331002,Blue light (physical force),Blue light (physical force),"This entry explicitly names the SNOMED semantic tag and the color, leaving no ambiguity that the concept is the physical force of blue light. Category: Physical force. It exactly matches Blue light (physical force) [285331002]. Any parent concept lacks the color specificity, and device- or therapy-related children are not implied. No additional attributes are introduced."
329731000009105,Megaptera novaeangliae (organism),Species mentioned: humpback whale—Megaptera novaeangliae,"The entry mentions the species by both common and scientific names, clearly indicating Megaptera novaeangliae. The main concept is the organism at species level, with no added attributes. In SNOMED CT this is an Organism concept, best represented by SCTID 329731000009105. Broader categories and other species are not suggested. Synonym pairing confirms equivalence and retains the precise species code."
113627009,Desulfotomaculum thermosapovorans (organism),Organism name recorded as Desulfotomaculum thermosapovorans,"The statement documents the organism name as Desulfotomaculum thermosapovorans, emphasizing identity only. The main concept is the species-level organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 113627009 is the correct, precise code. No additional attributes are present; it does not assert disease or site. Parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate because the species is explicitly stated."
217547008,Accident caused by normal gas fire in private dwelling (event),Accident due to a regular gas fire in a private home,"The wording uses ""regular gas fire"" as a synonym for ""normal gas fire"" and explicitly states the private home setting, which matches SNOMED CT Event 217547008. Parent concepts that do not distinguish the gas fire type are too broad, and sibling concepts for different causative devices are not applicable. No additional attributes such as injury severity or timing are present."
8609009,Traumatic agent (physical force),Imaging report: traumatic agent is physical force.,"An imaging report reiterates that the traumatic agent is physical force, which maps directly to Traumatic agent (physical force) [8609009]. The entry identifies the agent without providing injury details or specifying force subtype. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. This is more precise than generic Physical force because it is contextualized as an agent; child or sibling mechanisms are not mentioned."
309266009,Anal polyp specimen (specimen),Anal polyp specimen labeled,"The phrase indicates the existence of a specimen from an anal polyp and mentions labeling, a workflow detail that does not modify the specimen concept. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches 309266009 because the core concept is a specimen sourced from an anal polyp. Labeling does not imply a specific technique or subtype, so child concepts are not triggered, and it remains more precise than parent concepts lacking the site and source lesion."
1013911000202105,Pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate (substance),Pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate — specified substance,"The entry explicitly denotes the specified substance, naming the disodium salt of pemetrexed in hemipentahydrate form. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This exactness requires SCTID 1013911000202105 rather than parent or sibling concepts, and nothing in the wording implies product-level attributes or procedures."
1264561001,Living will (record artifact),Living will filed with health system,"This statement indicates the living will document is filed, emphasizing the artifact’s existence and placement. The main concept is the living will document; filing is an administrative detail. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact (information object). Living will (record artifact), SCTID 1264561001, is the exact match. A parent like Advance directive (record artifact) would be overly general, and siblings including DNR or POLST are different document types. The entry stays centered on the living will artifact, not a clinical status."
161693006,History of renal dialysis (situation),History item—renal dialysis.,"This problem-list style statement records renal dialysis as a history item, indicating prior occurrence. It matches the Situation with explicit context and specifically 'History of renal dialysis (situation)' SCTID 161693006. The entry does not indicate current performance of dialysis or specify hemodialysis vs peritoneal dialysis; therefore, procedure and modality-specific history concepts are less appropriate. The chosen concept is more specific than generic history categories."
1352822000,Union for International Cancer Control stage IVA (qualifier value),Multidisciplinary board: UICC stage IVA,"This entry documents a board discussion context while stating the UICC stage IVA only, reflecting the stage group qualifier. The main concept is UICC stage IVA, with no additional staging attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, mapping to Union for International Cancer Control stage IVA (qualifier value), SCTID 1352822000. Parent (UICC IV) and sibling subclasses (IVB/IVC), as well as AJCC variants, are inappropriate because the explicit UICC and 'A' subclass are given. The context does not alter the code selection."
771407002,Entire posterior rectus capitis muscle (body structure),Surgical anatomy: entire rectus capitis posterior muscle,"The context 'surgical anatomy' frames the anatomical entity without adding procedure details; 'entire' specifies the whole muscle. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This matches 'Entire posterior rectus capitis muscle' exactly. It does not specify major or minor parts (children), nor generalize to the suboccipital group (siblings), and it includes no additional attributes such as laterality or pathology."
297744006,Blackfoot language (qualifier value),Pharmacy label language: Blackfoot language,"This denotes that pharmacy labels are in Blackfoot language. The key concept is the specific language, a Qualifier value best represented by SNOMED CT 297744006. It avoids attributes such as reading ability or preference and does not mention dialects, keeping it squarely a language value. Parent language concepts are too general, and other specific language siblings would not match. It does not reference ethnicity or communication ability, ensuring precise mapping to the language."
242864003,Assault by poisoning with mace spray (event),Poisoning assault using mace spray,"The entry denotes an assault characterized by poisoning, explicitly specifying mace spray as the agent. This represents an external cause event rather than a clinical disorder. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242864003 is appropriate because it encodes an assault by poisoning with mace spray. Parent concepts like ‘Assault by poisoning (event)’ would be too broad without the agent, and sibling options like other chemical sprays would misidentify the substance. Disorder codes for mace spray poisoning would incorrectly center on the clinical condition rather than the event. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent rewording without added attributes."
1373370008,American Joint Committee on Cancer aN2b (qualifier value),Cancer staging summary: AJCC aN2b,"This summary line documents the AJCC autopsy nodal classification aN2b. The concept is a staging Qualifier value, not a diagnosis. SCTID 1373370008 is the precise SNOMED CT code for AJCC aN2b. A broader parent like aN2 or a sibling such as aN2a or cN2b/pN2b would not match the exact descriptor. The context prefix 'Cancer staging summary' does not introduce new attributes and keeps the meaning unchanged."
104278007,Borrelia burgdorferi antibody confirmatory test (procedure),Confirmatory testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi,"This describes confirmatory testing for antibodies against B. burgdorferi as a laboratory procedure. It fits the Procedure category and maps to 104278007. The entry avoids specifying method or isotype and includes no result or timing, thus excluding child concepts like immunoblot-specific tests or IgM/IgG-specific tests, and being more specific than a generic antibody test parent."
702856003,Family planning clinic (environment),Site of service: family planning clinic,"The phrase indicates the site where services are situated, namely the family planning clinic, and expresses a setting rather than an intervention. This belongs to the Environment category and maps precisely to Family planning clinic (environment), SCTID 702856003. 'Site of service' is contextual and does not shift the code to service delivery or procedures. A generic clinic site would be too broad, and sibling settings (e.g., reproductive health center) would not match the exact term."
172819009,Packing of cavity of nose (procedure),Nasal cavity packing,"The main concept is the procedure of packing the nasal cavity. This is a Procedure category in SNOMED CT and directly corresponds to SCTID 172819009 (Packing of cavity of nose). The wording is precise and does not introduce laterality, site subdivision (anterior/posterior), material, or indication. Broader parent concepts like generic nasal procedures would be less specific, and child/sibling procedures such as anterior or posterior nasal packing or removal of nasal pack would add details not stated here. “Nasal cavity packing” is a clinically standard synonym for the preferred term and remains semantically equivalent."
88648001,Lycodes turneri (organism),Follow-up documentation: Lycodes turneri,"This entry, placed in follow-up documentation, states the species Lycodes turneri without adding other clinical attributes. The main concept is the organism; category is Organism. The precise species name warrants selection of SNOMED CT 88648001. Parent or sibling organism concepts are not appropriate because the text provides the exact species, and no additional qualifiers alter the coding."
13811000181100,Halobacillus kuroshimensis (organism),Microbiology result: Halobacillus kuroshimensis,"The entry presents a microbiology result naming Halobacillus kuroshimensis, thus referring to the organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Even though this is within a lab-report context, the substantive concept is the organism’s taxon name, making the species-level organism code the most precise match, not a clinical finding code."
787864003,Product containing peptide hormone (product),Drug product containing peptide hormone,"The entry points to a drug product whose active ingredient belongs to the peptide hormone class. No additional attributes such as dose form, route, strength, brand, or indication are included. This matches the SNOMED CT Pharmaceutical/biologic product category and specifically SCTID 787864003. The phrase “drug product” is a synonym for medicinal/pharmaceutical product. A more general parent (any hormone product) would be less precise, and a child concept naming a specific peptide hormone would be overly specific relative to the wording."
51172005,Cryofibrinogen (substance),Topic: cryofibrinogen,"Here, cryofibrinogen is presented as the topic, with the sole coded concept being the cryofibrinogen substance. It falls under the SNOMED CT category Substance. The most precise match is Cryofibrinogen (substance) [51172005]. Using a broader parent like Fibrinogen would lose the defining cold-precipitable characteristic, and sibling terms (e.g., Cryoglobulin) represent other proteins. No disease state, test, or presence is claimed. The contextual label 'Topic' does not introduce new attributes and is clinically equivalent for selecting the substance code."
257605002,Factory (environment),At a factory,"This indicates the location as a factory without adding occupational, temporal, or causal attributes. It should be coded to SNOMED CT 'Factory (environment)' 257605002 (Environment or geographical location). More general parents (e.g., 'Workplace') lack specificity, and siblings such as 'Plant' or 'Mill' would be different concepts. The phrase 'at a factory' is a clinically equivalent way to denote the same environment."
328302009,Glucose powder (product),Glucose powder documented,"This indicates documentation of a product named glucose powder, pointing to the powder dose form as the only attribute and avoiding route or strength. The category is Product. SCTID 328302009 Glucose powder (product) is most accurate because it directly represents glucose in powder form. Parent or substance concepts lack form specificity, and sibling/child concepts implying other forms or routes are not supported by the entry."
736389007,Colorectal surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Colorectal surgery unit inpatient care plan,"Mentioning the 'unit' indicates an inpatient ward context while preserving the colorectal surgery domain and the artifact type as a care plan. Category: Record artifact. No additional attributes (e.g., postoperative status, severity, or discipline) are introduced. It is more specific than a general inpatient care plan and distinct from clinical pathways or procedure plans, aligning with SCTID 736389007."
244996006,Entire extensor indicis muscle (body structure),Whole extensor indicis muscle,"“Whole” clearly conveys the entirety of the extensor indicis muscle. The main concept is the complete muscle as a Body structure. This aligns exactly with SNOMED CT’s “Entire extensor indicis muscle” (244996006), rather than the more generic parent “Structure of extensor indicis muscle” which could include part-of structures, and it excludes sibling structures such as tendons or other extensor muscles."
264608006,0.012 inch (qualifier value),Reading of 0.012 inch,"This wording indicates a reading that equals 0.012 inch, but does not specify the nature of the measurement, leaving only the numeric value and unit. It belongs to SNOMED CT’s Qualifier value category and maps to 264608006. Choosing a parent like “inch” is not precise enough, and siblings with different numbers would be mismatched. The phrase “reading” is contextual and does not introduce attributes beyond the numeric unit value."
258905002,International unit per millimole of creatinine (qualifier value),Expressed in international unit per millimole of creatinine,"The entry states that values are expressed in the unit 'international unit per millimole of creatinine', with no analyte, sample, or numeric attributes included. As a unit designation, it is a Qualifier value, and SCTID 258905002 is the exact SNOMED CT code. More general parents or alternate denominators (e.g., per gram creatinine, per liter) are less appropriate given the specific IU per mmol creatinine expression. The singular 'unit' phrasing remains equivalent to the plural, not changing code selection."
257680005,Radio broadcasting station (environment),Venue: radio broadcasting station,"“Venue” here denotes the location/setting and specifies a radio broadcasting station, which is an Environment concept in SNOMED CT. The term aligns with SCTID 257680005 by retaining radio specificity. Broader parents or alternate-media siblings would be less accurate, and child concepts (e.g., studio rooms) are not implied. The entry adds no extra attributes like timing or causation, so the chosen concept remains the most precise match."
441969007,Time of patient departure from procedure room (observable entity),Procedure room departure timestamp (patient),"This specifies the timestamp for the patient's departure from the procedure room, an Observable entity representing a point in time. It precisely targets the same concept, avoiding broader or different time metrics like procedure start/end or arrival. 'Timestamp' is a common documentation synonym for 'time' and does not alter the concept; it maintains the exact context of departure from the procedure room."
2641000119104,Exposure to chlamydia (event),Referral reason: exposure to chlamydia,"This entry specifies that the reason for referral is exposure to chlamydia; the referral context does not alter the exposure concept. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Event hierarchy and is best coded as Exposure to chlamydia (event) [2641000119104]. Using a parent exposure concept would reduce specificity, while choosing infection, risk-only, or testing concepts would be inaccurate. The wording is an equivalent expression of the preferred term without introducing new attributes."
1336031007,Antibody to free-living Amoeba (substance),Laboratory antibody to free-living amoeba,"The main concept is an antibody directed at free-living amoeba, with 'laboratory' indicating context of use but not altering substance identity. This maps to the SNOMED CT Substance Antibody to free-living Amoeba (1336031007). It does not imply a patient result or therapeutic administration. Parent categories like antibody to organism are too broad, and child/sibling concepts for specific amoebae would be too narrow. The wording remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
16783651000119107,History of ankle surgery (situation),Past surgical history: ankle surgery,"This documentation-format entry places ankle surgery within the patient’s past surgical history, with no mention of laterality, specific operation, or causal condition. The category is Situation. The most precise match is 'History of ankle surgery (situation)' SCTID 16783651000119107. A generic parent like 'Past surgical history' or 'History of surgery' would not specify the ankle site. Child concepts naming specific ankle procedures (e.g., arthrodesis) would over-specify. Sibling concepts involving foot or leg surgery would be incorrect. The phrasing is a conventional way to express the same historical ankle surgery concept."
411665007,Citrus sinensis diagnostic allergen extract (product),"Diagnostic allergen extract, Citrus sinensis","The concept is a diagnostic allergen extract product with the source specified as Citrus sinensis. It is squarely within the Product category. The exact match is SNOMED CT 411665007, which designates Citrus sinensis diagnostic allergen extract. Parent products that do not specify the allergen source are too general, and sibling or child concepts like therapeutic extracts or other Citrus species are inappropriate. The comma-separated phrasing is a stylistic synonym that preserves the same clinical meaning."
371541002,Provider comment report (record artifact),Provider comment report in chart,"This entry identifies the artifact and notes its presence in the chart, without changing the document type. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Placement (“in chart”) is a contextual detail that does not convert it into another type (e.g., progress note or visit note). Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts with specific purposes (e.g., discharge summary) are not indicated. Therefore, the provider comment report concept (371541002) remains the best fit."
11718971000119100,Diarrhea in pregnancy (finding),Reason for test: pregnant with diarrhea,"As a test indication, this notes that the patient is pregnant and has diarrhea, confirming the pregnancy context without suggesting cause or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It should be coded as Diarrhea in pregnancy, since the occurrence is during pregnancy; broader diarrhea codes lack this specificity, and selecting an etiology-based or postpartum concept would miscode the statement. The wording is a safe synonym by context."
115492004,3-beta-Androstanediol glucuronide (substance),Reference compound: 3β-androstanediol glucuronide,"‘Reference compound’ indicates usage context but does not change the chemical identity, which is 3β-androstanediol glucuronide—a SNOMED CT Substance. It maps precisely to SCTID 115492004 and avoids ambiguity with broader androstanediol entities or other conjugates. The 3β specification prevents mapping to the 3α glucuronide sibling."
275531008,History of pacemaker in situ (situation),Patient-reported history: pacemaker in situ,"This presents the pacemaker in situ within patient-reported historical information, maintaining the explicit context. It belongs to Situation with explicit context. The precise SNOMED concept is “History of pacemaker in situ (situation),” because the history context is primary. It is not “Pacemaker in situ (finding)” since that lacks contextualized history. No device type or timing attributes are introduced, preserving semantic equivalence."
285334005,Long wave radiation (physical force),Chart entry: long wave radiation,"This indicates that long wave radiation is recorded in the chart, without any added attributes like exposure or injury. As a Physical force, the concept aligns with Long wave radiation (physical force) [285334005]. Using a parent concept would be insufficiently specific, and selecting a sibling such as infrared or short wave radiation would contradict the explicit long-wave designation."
214648001,"Nontraffic accident involving breakage of part of motor-driven snow vehicle, rider of animal or occupant of animal-drawn vehicle injured (event)",Nontraffic setting: snowmobile part broke; injury occurred to a rider of an animal or an occupant of an animal-drawn vehicle,"This captures nontraffic context, breakage of a part on a motor-driven snow vehicle (snowmobile), and the injured person category (animal rider or animal-drawn vehicle occupant). It is an external cause Event and best coded to SNOMED CT 214648001. Parent concepts would not specify the injured party; siblings would mismatch the victim type or traffic context. The synonyms used are appropriate and do not introduce additional attributes."
223915008,Tresco (geographic location),Location: Tresco,"The term labels the named place as a location, with Tresco as the sole coded concept. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The contextual word 'Location' does not create a different SNOMED concept; it simply frames the entry. Parent or sibling geographic entities are not implied. Thus SCTID 223915008 for Tresco is the precise match, with no added attributes beyond identifying the place."
416090009,Epilepsy monitoring verbal invite (procedure),Verbal invitation to undergo epilepsy monitoring,"This entry communicates a spoken invitation to undergo epilepsy monitoring, mapping to the Procedure “Epilepsy monitoring verbal invite” (416090009). The main concepts are the invitation and its verbal modality; there is no indication the monitoring was carried out or that a different mode was used. Parent concepts like general invitations lack the specific target service, and child concepts of monitoring procedures are excluded because only an invite is described. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
2441000181109,Capillary plasma specimen (specimen),I gave a capillary plasma specimen.,"The main concept is a provided specimen, explicitly capillary plasma, corresponding to the SNOMED CT Specimen concept Capillary plasma specimen. The patient voice adds context but no new clinical attributes. Mapping to generic plasma specimen would be less precise because the capillary origin is specified; mapping to venous or arterial plasma would be incorrect as the source is capillary. “Specimen” and “sample” are clinically equivalent here."
307439001,Four times daily (qualifier value),Frequency: four times daily,"This phrasing explicitly labels the instruction as a frequency, set at four times daily, without adding dose, route, timing schedule, or medication details. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value and directly corresponds to “Four times daily.” It is more specific than broader parents like “Daily” and does not shift to siblings such as “Three times daily” or “Every six hours.” The word “Frequency” clarifies the attribute type without altering the concept."
712706006,Nebulizing adaptor (physical object),Nebulizing adapter,"This entry names the same device using the US spelling adapter versus adaptor, without introducing any other attributes. It is a Physical object in SNOMED CT. The term focuses on the accessory used for nebulization and does not imply a nebulizer device, a mask, or any inline/ventilator configuration. Parent classes like non-specific device/adaptor are too broad, while children/siblings such as nebulizer components (mask, mouthpiece, T-piece) are too specific. The synonym is clinically equivalent to the preferred term, so SCTID 712706006 is appropriate."
1287018009,Antigen of live attenuated Zaire ebolavirus (substance),Component noted is live attenuated Zaire ebolavirus antigen,"The wording identifies the component as the antigen of live attenuated Zaire ebolavirus, which is a Substance. It matches the target concept through explicit inclusion of the species and the live-attenuated qualifier linked to an antigen. Parent concepts without specificity and siblings for other species or non-live forms are less apt. The contextual phrase “component noted” does not add clinical attributes such as severity or timing; it simply indicates documentation context while preserving the substance meaning, ensuring the same SNOMED concept selection."
223527002,Rwanda (geographic location),Index term: Rwanda,"Rwanda is listed as an index term, reflecting only the geographic location name without additional semantics. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). The correct match is Rwanda (geographic location) [223527002]. Parent categories would lose specificity, and no sibling or child locations within Rwanda are used."
249222005,Neonatal condition (observable entity),Condition of neonate,"This phrase denotes the observable condition of a neonate, matching the concept of a neonatal condition without specifying any findings, severity, or temporal constraints beyond neonatal age. It belongs to the Observable entity hierarchy and corresponds to Neonatal condition (observable entity) [249222005]. Using the term 'condition' keeps the scope as an observation, not a diagnosis. General parent concepts like Condition (observable entity) are less specific, and child or sibling concepts such as condition at birth or neonatal disorders add timing or disorder attributes that are not stated here. 'Neonate' is a clinically equivalent synonym for newborn, preserving the intended code."
6115000,Blood group antibody Anuszewska (substance),Anuszewska erythrocyte antibody.,"By stating 'erythrocyte antibody' with the Anuszewska name, this entry specifies the blood group antibody entity. That makes it a Substance concept, mapping to SNOMED CT 6115000. There is no assertion of detection, titer, isotype, or clinical status; thus, it is not a finding or result. The parent category 'Blood group antibody' is too broad, and any sibling with different specificity would be incorrect. 'Erythrocyte' is synonymous with 'red cell', preserving semantic equivalence."
364170003,Speed of swallowing (observable entity),Swallowing speed documented,"This documentation note still centers the concept on the speed of swallowing as the observable property, with no value or abnormality given. Category: Observable entity; code: SCTID 364170003. Since there are no phase qualifiers or related attributes, more specific children are not indicated, and siblings like frequency or duration do not match the wording. The documentation context does not alter the core concept."
301593009,Ability to manage stairs on all fours (observable entity),Hands-and-knees stair management ability,"The expression 'hands-and-knees' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'on all fours.' The entry describes the observable capability related to stair management using this posture, with no outcomes or qualifiers. As an Observable entity, it maps to SCTID 301593009. It does not collapse into a more general stair ability, nor does it specify direction, assistance, or speed, which would point to alternate child or sibling concepts; thus 301593009 is exact."
1155782000,Anatomic location directly invaded by primary malignant neoplasm of esophagus (observable entity),Direct invasion target site for the primary malignant neoplasm of the esophagus,"This text captures the observable target site that is directly invaded by the primary malignant neoplasm of the esophagus. It explicitly includes direct invasion and esophageal primary and focuses on the invaded location. The category is Observable entity. It best corresponds to SCTID 1155782000 because it references the esophagus-specific observation of invaded site without naming a particular structure or implying metastasis. Parent/sibling concepts that generalize across primaries or relocate to other primaries would be less fitting, and children specifying a particular target organ are too narrow. The synonymic wording does not alter the intended code."
364614003,Sagittal suture palpable vaginally (observable entity),Vaginal exam: sagittal suture present to palpation.,"The statement conveys that on vaginal exam, the sagittal suture can be palpated, using phrasing that is clinically equivalent to “palpable.” It introduces no orientation, station, or presentation attributes. SNOMED CT 364614003 (Observable entity) is the most precise code. Parents are too broad as they do not specify the sagittal suture, and siblings referencing other sutures do not match the described finding."
429832000,Biliary fluid specimen obtained by drainage (specimen),Biliary system drainage fluid—specimen,"This phrase designates a specimen of fluid from biliary system drainage, implying bile and the drainage method. It is a Specimen concept. The most precise code is 429832000, which encodes biliary fluid obtained by drainage. Using only the parent biliary fluid specimen concept would omit the method, and siblings tied to other acquisition techniques are not indicated here."
216410002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, public hall (environment)",Follow-up note: confirm place of occurrence is public hall,"This follow-up documentation confirms the location as a public hall, which matches the SNOMED CT place-of-occurrence concept 216410002. Main concept: place of occurrence of accident/poisoning; attribute: public hall environment. Category: Environment or geographical location. The entry remains specific to a public hall and does not suggest broader or different environments. No additional attributes (mechanism, severity, timing) are present, maintaining precise mapping."
255443008,Rubelliform (qualifier value),Noted to be rubelliform,"This phrasing indicates observation of the rubelliform quality without stating any additional clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 255443008 is the appropriate code since the content is a rubella-like morphological descriptor only. Coding to a disorder or finding would be less accurate. The wording avoids adding attributes such as severity, timing, or location, keeping the mapping uniquely to the rubelliform qualifier."
367734001,Structure of vein of the bulb of the penis (body structure),Patient asked about the vein in the bulb of the penis,A patient-reported context mentions the precise anatomical vein of the penile bulb. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The most accurate code is SCTID 367734001 because the statement targets the bulb-associated vein. It does not broaden to all penile veins (parent) or reference different structures like arteries or the bulb itself without vascular specification. The phrasing adds no clinical modifiers beyond anatomical identification.
737429003,Chronic kidney disease clinical management plan (record artifact),CKD treatment plan,"The entry refers to a treatment plan for chronic kidney disease, which in clinical documentation is synonymous with a clinical management plan. The main concept is the CKD-specific plan as a record artifact, not the disorder itself. Category: Record artifact. It matches 737429003 because it is condition-specific to CKD; broader parent concepts like 'treatment plan' without condition specificity would be less exact. Sibling concepts for other conditions are excluded. The term does not introduce details of therapy, severity, or timing, preserving the correct mapping."
28385006,Betula nigra (organism),Organism: Betula nigra,"This entry labels Betula nigra as an organism, directly matching the SNOMED Organism category. It specifies the species-level taxon and does not introduce attributes like exposure, allergy, or part/substance derivatives. The precision excludes parent taxa (genus Betula) and sibling species. Because it uniquely references the species rather than a product or finding, SCTID 28385006 (Betula nigra — organism) is the most appropriate code."
169598008,Antenatal care: gynecological risk (situation),Gynecological risk noted during prenatal care,"The phrase documents that a gynecological risk has been noted in the context of prenatal care. The main concept is the identification of gynecologic risk in pregnancy care with no added detail regarding condition or severity. This falls under Situation with explicit context. SCTID 169598008 is precise, as it encodes the antenatal care gynecological risk situation. Alternatives like high-risk pregnancy or obstetric risk are not appropriate since the descriptor is explicitly gynecological. The use of 'prenatal' as a synonym for 'antenatal' does not alter the coding."
49713007,Unexpected death (event),Coroner report: unexpected death,"This reflects a coroner's documentation classifying the death as unexpected; the reporting source does not introduce new clinical attributes. The main concept is an unexpected death event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps to 'Unexpected death (event)' 49713007 rather than generic death or sibling concepts, since no cause, timing, or specific subgroup is indicated."
70769000,"Gluteal-iliotibial fasciotomy, Ober type procedure (procedure)",Operative note: Ober technique iliotibial tract fasciotomy,"The entry indicates, within an operative note context, that an iliotibial tract fasciotomy was done using the Ober technique. The main concept is an Ober-type procedure targeting the iliotibial fascia. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This matches SCTID 70769000 due to the precise combination of site and eponym. Parent concepts like “Fasciotomy of limb fascia” are too generic, and siblings such as non-Ober releases or lengthenings would not match. “Iliotibial tract” is a synonymous term for the IT band, and “Ober technique” is clinically equivalent to “Ober-type,” preserving the intended code."
223587000,Myanmar (geographic location),Union of Myanmar,"This historical/official phrasing refers to the same country as Myanmar and denotes a single geographic location. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is Myanmar (geographic location) within the Location hierarchy, code 223587000. Mapping to a parent (Country) would be nonspecific, and no child entities (cities, regions) are present. The synonym is clinically equivalent to Myanmar and does not introduce attributes about residency, travel, or events."
118020007,Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 AND 2 antibody band pattern determination (procedure),Chart problem list: HTLV-1/2 antibody band pattern determination,"Even in a problem-list style notation, the entry unambiguously describes the procedure of determining the antibody band pattern for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, which is a Procedure. SCTID 118020007 is the most precise match. More general or single-type concepts would not reflect the specified combined band pattern determination. The compact phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term without adding attributes."
432099000,Specimen from urinary bladder obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),"Specimen: bladder, fine needle aspiration biopsy","This entry denotes a specimen with source 'bladder' and acquisition method 'fine needle aspiration biopsy'. It falls under the SNOMED CT Specimen category. The exact elements required by the concept—urinary bladder as the origin and FNA biopsy as the technique—are present, making 432099000 the most accurate code. Using only 'biopsy' without specifying 'fine needle aspiration' would be a sibling and less precise, and 'bladder aspirate' without biopsy could map to a different specimen concept. The wording is a straightforward, semantically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term."
1295439006,Femoral neck fixation sleeve (physical object),Femoral neck fixation sleeve item,"The term “item” is a general descriptor for an individual device and does not alter the concept. This is still a femoral neck fixation sleeve, a Physical object, best represented by SCTID 1295439006. Parent device-item concepts lack specificity, and sibling concepts involve different hardware or anatomical locales. The wording avoids attributes like laterality, severity, or timing, preserving the intended code."
289703003,Finding of pattern of uterine contractions (finding),OB note: uterine contraction pattern present,"The entry states a clinical finding that a uterine contraction pattern is present, without characterizing the pattern. It belongs to the Clinical finding category. SCTID 289703003 (Finding of pattern of uterine contractions) is the precise match because the wording addresses the pattern as the subject of the finding. Concepts specifying normality, abnormality, regularity, tachysystole, or adequacy would be too specific, and broader parents that do not mention pattern would be less precise. 'Uterine contraction pattern present' is a clinically equivalent expression of the preferred term."
309902002,Clinical oncology department (environment),Treating department: Clinical oncology department,"Here, the treating department is the clinical oncology department, explicitly naming the Environment. It maps directly to 'Clinical oncology department (environment).' The wording does not introduce outpatient or inpatient qualifiers, nor subtype distinctions (radiation vs medical oncology), so broader parents are too generic and sibling/child concepts are inappropriate."
1085901000112106,Carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter lwoffii (organism),Acinetobacter lwoffii carbapenemase producer,"The entry identifies the species Acinetobacter lwoffii and describes it as a 'carbapenemase producer,' a synonymous phrase for carbapenemase-producing. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This directly matches 'Carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter lwoffii (organism)' because the species and mechanism are both specified. A parent organism concept lacking the enzymatic attribute or a sibling focusing on resistance without mechanism would be less accurate. It avoids any clinical context or site, thus no disorder or infection concepts apply."
366032002,Finding of position of ciliary body (finding),Ciliary body position addressed in the visit note,"The entry shows that the visit documentation addresses the Clinical finding of the ciliary body's position. It maps accurately to SNOMED CT 366032002 because it specifies the positional finding for the ciliary body, with no additional qualifiers (e.g., normal/abnormal, directional, laterality). Parent concepts are less specific and children describing particular positional deviations are not supported by the neutral wording. The phrasing is a context-based paraphrase that maintains the same concept."
97531000119106,History of parietal cerebrovascular accident (situation),S/p parietal stroke,"The abbreviation 's/p' (status post) indicates a completed past event, i.e., a prior parietal stroke, which qualifies as a Situation with explicit context. This exactly matches 'History of parietal cerebrovascular accident (situation)' because it expresses the history of a stroke localized to the parietal lobe without adding details such as laterality or stroke subtype. Parent concepts like 'history of stroke' are too general, and sibling concepts focusing on other regions or current findings would be inappropriate."
35557001,Amyelois chronic stunt virus (organism),Amyelois chronic stunt virus (virus species),"The text explicitly specifies a virus species and names it exactly, with no added clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 35557001 corresponds to the Amyelois chronic stunt virus organism concept. More general parents are not precise enough; child concepts imply strains or subtypes not mentioned, and siblings would indicate other viruses, which this does not."
443031000124106,Adult critical care formula (product),Adult critical-care nutrition formula,"This entry explicitly frames the item as a nutrition formula intended for adult critical-care patients, which is exactly the intended product. There are no added details about route, macronutrient composition, brand, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Product, with Adult critical care formula (product) [443031000124106] the best match. More general parent products lack the adult qualifier, and any child specifying special features (e.g., with fiber, high-calorie) would be incorrect. The addition of 'nutrition' is descriptive but does not introduce a new attribute beyond the inherent nature of a formula."
763004009,University of Texas Wound Classification System grade (observable entity),UT Wound Classification System—grade,"The hyphenated label makes explicit the grade component of the UT Wound Classification System. It represents an observable entity only, without specifying a numeric grade, stage, or other attributes. This aligns best with the SNOMED concept for UT wound classification grade, not the entire classification system or the stage component."
224017006,Newfoundland (geographic location),Referral location: Newfoundland,"The entry indicates a referral context while identifying the location 'Newfoundland.' The concept remains a Geographic location, suitable for Newfoundland (geographic location) SCTID 224017006. Using parent or sibling concepts (Canada, Labrador, Newfoundland and Labrador) would be imprecise or incorrect. The referral context frames usage but does not alter the underlying geographic entity."
401230005,Plans for deliberate self harm without intent (finding),"Crisis evaluation: plan for deliberate self-harm identified, no intent.","This records a crisis evaluation that identifies a deliberate self-harm plan with no intent. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps exactly to SCTID 401230005 because it captures planning without intention. The evaluation context is incidental; it does not introduce other attributes. It should not be coded as ideation, intent-present, or attempt because the wording excludes those."
420979006,New Mexico (geographic location),New Mexico—documented location,"The core coded concept is New Mexico; 'documented location' simply indicates clinical context. Category: Geographic location (Location). The entry does not add detail that would change coding (e.g., specific city, region). It is therefore correctly mapped to SCTID 420979006 rather than a parent (nation) or child (localities within New Mexico)."
732141005,Entire eye region (body structure),Eye region (entire),"By explicitly indicating 'entire' in parentheses, the entry conveys the complete eye-related anatomical region. This is a Body structure and should be coded to SNOMED CT 732141005, which captures the entire eye region. The parent 'Eye region' would be less specific without the completeness qualifier, and child/sibling concepts like 'Orbital region' or 'Periorbital region' would misrepresent the scope. The parenthetical qualifier maintains equivalence to 'entire' without adding new attributes."
715111005,Does not transfer from wheelchair to chair (finding),Wheelchair-to-chair transfer absent,"The entry denotes absence of the specific transfer (wheelchair to chair) as a functional finding, without adding new attributes. This maps to a Clinical finding, with SNOMED CT 715111005 as the correct code. Using broader or alternative destination transfer concepts would be less accurate. “Absent” functions as a synonym for non-performance of this transfer, preserving the concept and code."
12666009,Cholecystocolostomy (procedure),Patient underwent cholecystocolostomy,"The sentence documents that the patient had the cholecystocolostomy performed, i.e., the gallbladder–colon surgical connection. No timing qualifiers beyond the fact of undergoing the procedure are specified, and no approach or indication is added. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 12666009 is the precise code because it denotes the exact anastomosis performed; parent and sibling procedures targeting other intestinal sites would be incorrect. The patient-reported/clinical phrasing is semantically equivalent to naming the procedure."
328712000,Gluten-free baguette (product),Bakery listing: gluten-free baguette,"The entry describes a product listed in a bakery, specifically a gluten-free baguette. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 328712000 Gluten-free baguette (product) is the precise match, given the explicit identification of both form and gluten-free status. Parent concepts are either too general regarding form or diet attribute, and sibling products (e.g., gluten-free roll, ciabatta) are different types. The context does not introduce attributes like preparation state or package size."
52589007,Free-standing orthopedics clinic (environment),Facility documented as independent orthopedic clinic,"The facility is described as an independent orthopedic clinic, a synonym for free-standing. The main concept is the healthcare environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 52589007 is the precise code because it denotes a free-standing orthopedics clinic. A broader parent concept would omit independence, and siblings tied to hospital-based settings or departments would be incorrect. The entry does not add attributes beyond the environment."
161509009,History of varicose veins (situation),History of varicose veins.,"The wording explicitly states a past history of varicose veins, making the main concept a prior occurrence of varicose veins. This is a Situation with explicit context in SNOMED CT, not a current disorder. Therefore, SCTID 161509009 (History of varicose veins) is the most precise match. Using the disorder code for varicose veins would be inaccurate because the entry does not assert current disease. Broader history concepts (e.g., history of venous disease) are less specific, and family history concepts are not mentioned. The phrase is a direct expression of the same situation concept without adding attributes."
397272004,Bulbar conjunctiva feature (observable entity),Bulbar conjunctiva observable,"The entry refers to an observable aspect of the bulbar conjunctiva, with no outcome or diagnostic interpretation. This matches the Observable entity category and maps accurately to SCTID 397272004 (Bulbar conjunctiva feature). ‘Observable’ is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of ‘feature’ within SNOMED’s observable entity hierarchy. Parent concepts that omit the bulbar specification or sibling concepts involving palpebral conjunctiva are less suitable. No clinical finding or measurement result is implied."
184755000,Shotgun application certificate (record artifact),Shotgun application certificate in scanned documents,"This indicates the artifact appears among scanned documents, but the underlying concept remains the shotgun application certificate. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and SCTID 184755000 precisely matches. More general certificates or siblings like 'shotgun certificate' (license) would not include the application qualifier. The 'scanned documents' context does not change the artifact type or status."
782794008,Xenograft of skin (substance),Graft material: skin xenograft,"This entry identifies the material type and specifies xenogeneic skin graft tissue, directly mapping to Xenograft of skin (substance), SCTID 782794008. Category is Substance. The context word “Graft material” does not introduce action or timing. Parent concepts would be overly broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., allograft of skin) conflict with xenogeneic nature. Device or procedural interpretations are excluded by focusing on the material."
401854005,"Spring truss slotted polished spring ends, double (physical object)","Spring truss—double, slotted, polished spring ends.","This entry identifies a device: a spring truss that is double and whose spring ends are both slotted and polished. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The inclusion of ‘double’ and ‘slotted, polished spring ends’ ensures a precise match to 401854005, not a broader parent (e.g., generic spring truss) or a sibling (e.g., single spring truss or unpolished ends). The hyphenated formatting is purely stylistic and preserves the same attributes, maintaining equivalence to the FSN."
893046241000119101,History of cytomegalovirus infection (situation),"Cytomegalovirus infection, by history","The phrase states CMV infection exists in the patient’s history, meaning a past infection without current activity. The concept is a historical CMV infection only. It is a Situation with explicit context and maps most precisely to History of cytomegalovirus infection (situation), SCTID 893046241000119101. It does not introduce attributes like congenital status, organ-specific disease, or lab serology, so child or sibling disorder concepts are less appropriate. “By history” is a standard synonym indicating past medical context and does not change code selection."
251844004,Fluid output from surgical drain (observable entity),Monitoring parameter: surgical drain fluid output,"This describes the measurement parameter monitored: surgical drain fluid output, without adding rate, numeric values, or site. It clearly sits in the Observable entity category and maps to SCTID 251844004. Parent concepts lacking 'surgical drain' or siblings tied to specific devices or rates would be less suitable. The phrasing as a 'monitoring parameter' maintains semantic equivalence with the target concept."
18710005,Underwater habitat (environment),Underwater habitat environment,"This entry reiterates the environmental nature of an underwater habitat, directly matching Underwater habitat (environment), SCTID 18710005. It fits the Environment or geographical location category. The wording introduces no additional attributes and does not imply any subtype. It is more specific than parent concepts like underwater environment and avoids siblings such as marine habitat. The phrase is a semantically equivalent clarification rather than a different concept."
411580006,Dog dander diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract — dog dander,This identifies a diagnostic allergen extract and specifies dog dander as the allergenic material. Category: Product. The dash is stylistic; meaning is unchanged. Parent concepts like generic diagnostic extracts lack source detail; child concepts with particular testing formats aren’t indicated. Sibling concepts for other species would be wrong. Suitable for SCTID 411580006.
167870008,Wrist joint synovial fluid (specimen),Radiocarpal joint synovial fluid specimen,"The term 'radiocarpal joint' is a clinically accepted synonym for the wrist joint, and combined with 'synovial fluid specimen' it precisely describes Wrist joint synovial fluid (specimen), SCTID 167870008. Category: Specimen. There are no added attributes such as laterality or condition. Parent concepts omitting the site are too broad, and siblings specifying other joints would misrepresent the source. The use of 'radiocarpal' is a site synonym, not a different concept, so the code remains the same."
446247009,Debridement of wound of upper limb (procedure),Debridement of upper limb wound documented,"The core concept is a documented debridement of an upper limb wound, with no elaboration on method, laterality, or subsite. This is a Procedure in SNOMED CT. The best fit is Debridement of wound of upper limb (446247009) due to explicit action and regional site. A site-unspecified parent would be less precise, and any child specifying hand or forearm would be beyond the stated detail. The phrase 'documented' adds context and does not change the procedure concept."
285721006,Momentum (physical force),History note: momentum,"The phrase uses a documentation context 'History note:' without introducing new attributes. The concept is momentum, mapping to SNOMED CT Momentum (physical force) [285721006]. Parent Physical force is too broad, and sibling constructs such as force or kinetic energy are different. Thus, the momentum code is the most accurate given the entry."
422843007,Chief complaint section (record artifact),EHR chief complaint section,"This entry references the chief complaint section as implemented in the electronic health record (EHR), still identifying the section artifact rather than any patient complaint content. The main concept is the section labeled “Chief complaint” in the EHR, category Record artifact. Code 422843007 is the precise match. Mapping to broader EHR artifacts or document framework would be too general, and to sibling sections (e.g., Review of systems section) would be incorrect. It does not imply the clinical finding Chief complaint; it only denotes the documentation section."
418781000,Operations of war (event),Operations of war referenced in clinician note,"This wording references the event operations of war in a clinical note, while not adding attributes like cause or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and SCTID 418781000 is the correct code. Parents like general war or military activity would be imprecise, and children specifying types of operations would over-specify. The clinical note context simply frames the concept and maintains the same code selection."
1259274009,Structure of ligament of joint of lesser toe of left foot (body structure),"Documented anatomy: ligament at the joint of a lesser toe, left foot","The core content denotes an anatomical ligament at the joint of a lesser toe on the left foot, which is within the Body structure hierarchy. This directly matches Structure of ligament of joint of lesser toe of left foot (1259274009). The documentation context does not add pathological or procedural attributes. Absence of joint subtype or ligament subtype prevents drift to child concepts, while parents or siblings without lesser toe or left laterality are less precise."
443351000124102,Increased fiber formula (product),Product: fiber-added formula,"This entry denotes a product—'fiber-added formula'—which is clinically equivalent to increased fiber formula. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 443351000124102 is the correct match because it focuses on a formula with increased fiber content. Parent concepts lacking the fiber descriptor are too general, and child concepts introducing brand or demographic specifics are too detailed. The synonym 'fiber-added' does not introduce additional attributes beyond fiber increase."
223816005,Westmeath (geographic location),Service area: Westmeath,"The entry marks “Westmeath” as the service area, identifying the geographic location. The main concept is the place name; ‘service area’ is contextual and does not change the identity or administrative specificity of the location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223816005 fits exactly because the place is named without additional qualifiers. Parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling administrative variants would be inappropriate without explicit wording. This remains an equivalent reference to the same location concept."
734008008,Spacing of teeth (observable entity),Spacing between teeth,"This phrase is a clear paraphrase of the observable entity measuring the space between teeth. It is an Observable entity and aligns with SCTID 734008008 since it identifies the parameter itself rather than a diagnosis or outcome. Parent or sibling findings like malocclusion or diastema imply conditions with patterns or severity, which are not present in this neutral, measurement-focused wording."
422462002,Margin reflex distance (observable entity),Distance from corneal light reflex to eyelid margin,"This is a descriptive definition of MRD, specifying the measurement between the corneal light reflex and the eyelid margin without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 422462002 maps directly to margin reflex distance. Variants such as MRD1/MRD2 are not implied since neither upper nor lower lid is mentioned, and related but different measurements (palpebral fissure height) are not described."
701128008,"Stationary basic diagnostic x-ray system, analog (physical object)",Film-based stationary general radiography unit,"The entry specifies a film-based (analog) unit for general radiography that is stationary. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). SCTID 701128008 is the precise code, representing a stationary basic diagnostic x-ray system with analog imaging. Parents do not enforce the analog or stationary constraints, and siblings including film-based mobile units or stationary digital units would be inconsistent with the text. 'Film-based' directly equates to analog without altering scope."
1293073005,Plain X-ray cephalometry (procedure),Cephalometric X-ray—plain film obtained,"The entry indicates a cephalometric X-ray obtained via plain film, avoiding view, timing, or indication details. Category: Procedure. Plain X-ray cephalometry (procedure) [1293073005] fits precisely because it denotes cephalometric evaluation by standard radiography. Parent concepts are too broad, and child concepts such as lateral/PA cephalograms are not implied. The synonyms “plain film” and “X-ray” are equivalent to plain radiography and keep the code selection stable."
217734000,Transport vehicle washed off road by storm (event),History note: transport vehicle washed off road by storm,"A history note reiterates the event where a transport vehicle was washed off a road by storm. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The entry maps exactly to SCTID 217734000, and avoids parent generalities or child specifics. It includes no timing or severity modifiers and does not specify vehicle subtype, preserving precise equivalence to the preferred concept."
438211004,Pseudoalteromonas mariniglutinosa (organism),Bacterial species: Pseudoalteromonas mariniglutinosa,"This phrasing indicates a species-level taxonomic identification of a bacterium and names the species explicitly. In SNOMED CT, this is best represented by the Organism concept SCTID 438211004. A parent like Pseudoalteromonas (organism) is imprecise, and any sibling species would not match the text. No additional attributes such as infection, site, or timing are present, so the species code is the correct choice."
213805002,"Train collision with fallen tree, pedestrian injured (event)",Witness report: pedestrian injured when train hit a fallen tree,"Despite the witness-report context, the clinical content is unchanged: train hit a fallen tree and a pedestrian was injured. This fits the Event class in SNOMED CT. It is more precise than generic train accident events and does not match sibling concepts with different injured parties or different collision objects. “Hit” as a synonym for collision maintains semantic equivalence without changing code selection."
224069001,Mississippi (geographic location),Patient resides in Mississippi,"This entry identifies “Mississippi” as the geographic location, with residence given as contextual usage. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Mississippi (geographic location) [224069001] is the most accurate code because the phrase specifies the place without narrowing to sublocations or changing to a different type of entity. Parent concepts would be nonspecific, and siblings such as “Mississippi River” or “Jackson, Mississippi” are not indicated. The paraphrase retains the same location concept and does not alter code selection."
46354000,Natural force (physical force),Physical force—natural origin,"The phrase conveys that the physical force has natural origin, without adding any other qualifiers. The main concept is a natural physical force. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. This aligns precisely with Natural force (physical force) [46354000] because the origin (natural) is the defining characteristic. It is not a specific subtype and does not introduce exposure, injury, or timing. Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise given the explicit natural origin."
1184589008,Social history document section (record artifact),Social history section of the medical record,"This entry identifies a section within the patient’s medical record devoted to social history. No patient-specific social details are provided, keeping the focus on the record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps most precisely to SCTID 1184589008 because it specifies a social history document section rather than generic record content. Parent concepts like ‘Document section’ are too general, and sibling concepts (e.g., family history section) are incorrect. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym indicating a section within the medical record."
84317008,Phosphonacetic acid (substance),Substance identified: phosphonacetic acid,"This entry explicitly identifies the substance as phosphonacetic acid, with no added attributes regarding salt, mixture, or dosage. The core concept is the chemical entity. It maps to Phosphonacetic acid (substance), SCTID 84317008, within the Substance category. Choosing a parent, salt, or product code would be incorrect, as the naming is specific to the base substance rather than any derivative or formulated item."
301581000,Ability to manage steps and stairs (observable entity),Follow-up topic: steps and stairs ability,"This entry is a follow-up documentation label for the observable domain of steps/stairs ability. It is an Observable entity and maps directly to SNOMED CT 301581000. The wording remains neutral without introducing outcome values or assistance, severity, timing, or causes. Parent observables that are more general (e.g., overall mobility) are too broad, and child observables that subdivide ascent/descent are too narrow relative to the combined domain. Findings implying deficit are a distinct category, making 301581000 the most accurate match."
1149162008,International Staging System for multiple myeloma (staging scale),Pathology comment: International Staging System for multiple myeloma utilized,"This comment documents that the ISS for myeloma was utilized, identifying the staging scale rather than a stage outcome. SNOMED category: Record artifact (assessment scale). It precisely corresponds to SCTID 1149162008. It avoids mapping to parents like general staging scales or siblings such as R-ISS. No extra attributes are included."
162010006,No mouth problem (situation),No issue involving the mouth,"This phrasing uses “issue” as a clinical synonym for “problem” and states its absence for the mouth. No extra attributes (severity, timing, etiology) are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Situation, mapped to 162010006. Parent concepts are too general; child/sibling concepts (e.g., “No gum problem,” “Oral cavity normal”) either narrow to a specific subpart or represent a normal finding. “Issue” is semantically equivalent to “problem” in this context, preserving code selection."
256368004,Leukocyte buffy coat - irradiated (product),Irradiated buffy coat (leukocyte component),"This entry specifies a leukocyte component known as buffy coat and states that it is irradiated, which defines the intended Product. The wording stays focused on the product, not a procedure or specimen. It does not introduce donor characteristics, indications, or preparation details beyond irradiation. Therefore, it maps precisely to Leukocyte buffy coat - irradiated (product) and not to the broader parent or a sibling component."
411227006,Pesticide patch test product (product),Pesticide patch test substance (product),"The entry points to a patch testing substance and explicitly clarifies its product nature, maintaining equivalence with the preferred term without adding attributes. Category: Product. This maps directly to SCTID 411227006 because it denotes the pesticide patch test product. A parent like “Patch test substance (product)” would be insufficiently specific, and children for particular pesticide chemicals would be too specific. Siblings focused on non-pesticide allergens would not be correct."
463434002,Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) device disinfectant test strip (physical object),Strip for testing OPA device disinfectant,"The entry refers to a strip used for testing OPA device disinfectant, describing the same physical object as the preferred concept. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It precisely matches SCTID 463434002 by specifying OPA and the function (test strip for device disinfectant), without adding extra attributes. Generic strip or indicator parent concepts are too broad; sibling concepts for other chemical test strips would be inappropriate. The paraphrase 'strip for testing' is a clinically equivalent way to express 'test strip.'"
223654007,Republic of Moldova (geographic location),Returned from the Republic of Moldova,"This indicates the country Republic of Moldova as the geographic location from which the person returned. The precise SNOMED CT mapping for the location is 223654007. A parent like ‘Country’ is overly broad; no narrower child locations are named. Despite the travel-return context, the entry continues to reference only the national entity, not events or regions, ensuring the best-fit code is the country-level geographic location."
1002243003,Product containing adrenergic receptor antagonist (product),Product containing an adrenergic receptor antagonist,"The wording explicitly states a product that contains an adrenergic receptor antagonist as the active ingredient/class, aligning with the SNOMED CT product hierarchy. It matches Product containing adrenergic receptor antagonist (SCTID 1002243003). There are no additional attributes (e.g., specific ingredient, alpha/beta subtype, dose form, route, indication, timing), so narrower child concepts are not implied. Sibling concepts like agonists or non-receptor sympatholytics are excluded by the receptor antagonist descriptor, and parents lacking this class would be less specific."
44867008,Structure of accessory nerve sternocleidomastoid muscle branch (body structure),Accessory nerve SCM branch,"This concise entry references the accessory nerve and abbreviates sternocleidomastoid as SCM, clarifying the specific branch. The main concept is the branch of CN XI to the SCM, with the attribute 'branch' inherent to the anatomic description. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It aligns exactly with SCTID 44867008 rather than broader nerve structures or other branches. Parent concepts like 'Accessory nerve structure' would be less specific, and sibling concepts like 'Accessory nerve trapezius branch' would be wrong. The abbreviation SCM is a commonly used clinical shorthand and maintains equivalence without changing code selection."
718884007,Comprehensive Assessment of At-risk Mental States unusual thought content frequency and duration score (observable entity),Mental health visit: CAARMS unusual thought content frequency/duration rating,"This entry uses a visit context but clearly denotes the CAARMS rating for frequency/duration of unusual thought content. As an observable entity, it is a specific measurement within CAARMS, matching SCTID 718884007. Parent concepts like global CAARMS ratings or sibling measures (e.g., intensity) are less appropriate because the wording names frequency/duration. 'Rating' is an acceptable synonym for 'score' in this standardized tool."
250396003,Diego antigen type (finding),Diego antigen type documented in immunohematology record,"This statement situates the finding within an immunohematology record but still refers specifically to the Diego antigen type as the medical concept. Category: Clinical finding. The contextual phrase does not introduce method, timing, or specific antigen presence; it preserves the general type finding. SCTID 250396003 is the precise code. Broader parent concepts lack the Diego detail, and narrower child concepts specifying particular Diego antigen outcomes are not indicated."
278299007,Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation risk of hospital death score (observable entity),Acute Physiology & Chronic Health Evaluation mortality risk (hospital) score,"This version expands APACHE to its full name and states it is the hospital mortality risk score, matching the intended observable. It does not introduce timing, severity, or versioning, and thus aligns with SNOMED CT 278299007. Alternatives like general mortality findings or APACHE severity indices would be less appropriate, while this entry captures the exact risk-of-hospital-death score."
64274004,Structure of nervous system ganglion (body structure),Educational topic: nervous system ganglion,"In an educational context, the subject is the anatomical nervous system ganglion, making SNOMED CT 64274004 (Body structure) the correct concept. The entry excludes attributes like type, location, or disease, so it is neither too broad (parent anatomy) nor too narrow (child ganglion subtypes). The wording remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
61828008,Lysogeny (finding),Bacterium in lysogenic state,"This phrasing identifies the bacterium as being in the lysogenic state, which is the definition of lysogeny. As a Clinical finding, it matches Lysogeny (finding) [61828008]. It does not add specifics like bacterial species, site, or temporal qualifiers. Sibling concepts such as lytic cycle or lysogenic conversion are not implied, ensuring accurate selection of the concept code."
411610008,Rat urine proteins diagnostic allergen extract (product),Rat urine proteins diagnostic testing allergen,"This phrase identifies an allergen used in diagnostic testing derived from rat urine proteins, representing a product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It aligns with SCTID 411610008 based on the explicit rat urine protein origin and diagnostic testing context. Parent concepts for diagnostic allergens without source specification are too broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., rat epithelium allergens) are not appropriate. The compact wording remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
715164009,Assessment using Repertory Grid (procedure),Assessment employing the Repertory Grid,"Employing the Repertory Grid in an assessment identifies the same procedural event and instrument. This is a Procedure and best maps to Assessment using Repertory Grid (SCTID 715164009). A parent assessment procedure lacks instrument specificity; other instrument-based assessments are siblings and therefore not correct. Employing is synonymous with using, not adding timing, severity, or indication, so the code choice remains unchanged."
248592006,Character of cough (observable entity),Quality of cough,"This entry specifies the qualitative aspect of a cough in observable terms, aligning with Character of cough (Observable entity, SCTID: 248592006). It avoids indicating existence of cough as a finding or any particular subtype or degree. Parent concepts like general symptom quality are less specific, and sibling concepts such as severity or duration of cough are not mentioned, keeping this code as the best fit."
707213008,"Alpha fetoprotein, L3 (substance)",AFP-L3 (Lens culinaris–reactive fraction),"This entry combines the common name AFP-L3 with a clarifying parenthetical that it is the Lens culinaris–reactive fraction, clearly denoting the substance. There are no mentions of levels, percentage, or testing, so the Substance category applies. The correct code is SCTID 707213008. Parent and sibling concepts (general AFP or other fractions) would be less precise. The parenthetical clarifier restates the same concept and does not add an extraneous attribute."
47085007,Genus Bdellovibrio (organism),Genus Bdellovibrio,"This phrasing identifies the organism at the genus rank, Bdellovibrio, and nothing else. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, matched by Genus Bdellovibrio (organism), SCTID 47085007. A family-level or order-level organism would be broader, and any species name would be narrower, so neither parent nor child concepts are appropriate. The term is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not introduce attributes like detection or pathogenicity."
162467007,Free of symptoms (situation),Triage note: asymptomatic,"This triage documentation states the patient is asymptomatic, i.e., free of symptoms, without specifying any particular symptom or condition. The main concept is absence of symptoms in a contextual documentation setting, which is best modeled as a Situation and specifically “Free of symptoms (situation)” (162467007). A Clinical finding code would be less appropriate given the triage context. Sibling concepts concerning no complaints or sign absence differ from the symptom-free status. The use of “asymptomatic” is a clinically equivalent synonym for free of symptoms."
327998007,Gluten-free food product (product),Shelf tag: gluten-free food product,"A shelf tag indicates the item is a gluten-free food product, mapping to the Product category concept Gluten-free food product (327998007). The retail display context does not add clinical attributes or convert it into a regimen or procedure. Parent concepts are too general, and named item children would be too specific."
469553004,Full-body radiant heating system (physical object),Whole-body radiant warming unit,"The term 'unit' is a standard synonym for a device/system and, combined with 'whole-body' and 'radiant warming,' precisely identifies the same object. Category: Physical object. This matches SCTID 469553004 better than parent or sibling concepts, which would lack either whole-body scope or radiant modality. No additional attributes are introduced."
1303450008,Bone structure of metatarsophalangeal joint region (body structure),Surgical exposure: bony structures of the MTP joint region,"This operative note-style entry points to the bone structures of the metatarsophalangeal joint region, a Body structure matching SCTID 1303450008. The phrasing emphasizes osseous anatomy, excluding non-bony tissues, and does not add qualifiers like side, toe number, or disease processes, thereby keeping it distinct from the entire joint region concept and from more specific child anatomical entities."
717709005,Adjustable orthopedic fixation plate (physical object),Packaging label text: adjustable orthopedic fixation plate,The entry specifies the product labeling and names the device as an adjustable orthopedic fixation plate. It reflects a physical object without adding other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 717709005 is the correct selection because it captures the specific device type with adjustability. More general device concepts or alternative plate designs would not align with the exact phrasing.
229519004,"Passive movements to the shoulder girdle, function (observable entity)",Rehab note: shoulder girdle passive movement function,"In a rehabilitation documentation context, this entry identifies the observable functional element concerned with passive movements of the shoulder girdle. The wording avoids laterality, severity, or values, keeping it strictly to the function observable. As an Observable entity, it describes something assessed rather than performed or diagnosed. It is more precise than a parent like generalized shoulder function and does not imply active movement or ROM measurement, which would be sibling/child concepts. The context label ‘Rehab note’ does not change code selection, so SCTID 229519004 best fits."
57921000052103,Whole blood specimen with edetic acid (specimen),Laboratory specimen: whole blood in EDTA,"This lab-oriented entry identifies whole blood as the specimen and EDTA (edetic acid) as the additive, directly matching the concept. It is a Specimen in SNOMED CT and is optimally coded as SCTID 57921000052103. A parent such as ‘Whole blood specimen’ would be less precise due to missing additive detail, and siblings indicating other additives (e.g., citrate) are not appropriate. EDTA is a synonymous term for edetic acid; the synonym does not introduce new attributes. The entry avoids test names, timing, or collection site information."
1260430001,Free lumbar artery perforator flap (substance),Flap material identified: free lumbar artery perforator flap,"The statement identifies the flap material as a free lumbar artery perforator flap, i.e., the substance used. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It exactly matches 'Free lumbar artery perforator flap (substance)' SCTID: 1260430001. More general parents or alternative perforator flap siblings would be less specific, and procedure concepts are not indicated. No additional attributes are present."
224650005,Mill (environment),Place of occurrence: mill,"This denotes the place where something occurred as a mill, focusing solely on the environmental setting. It maps cleanly to Mill (environment), SCTID 224650005, within Environment or geographical location. The phrase avoids specifying the event details, timing, or causality, so it is not better served by event or incident-specific codes. Parent concepts like general place or industrial site are too broad; no child concept is implied, maintaining precision."
224709006,Location inside building (environment),Located inside a building,"This statement indicates that the location is inside a building, mapping directly to Location inside building (environment) [224709006]. It includes no extraneous attributes like time or purpose. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (environment). It is more precise than a general location concept and less specific than naming a particular room or facility type. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
712631000,Macro alkaline phosphatase (substance),Macro alkaline phosphatase enzyme,"The entry explicitly states the enzyme nature of the macro form of alkaline phosphatase and includes no finding or test attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, reflecting a defined biochemical entity. It narrows appropriately beyond the parent alkaline phosphatase concept and does not suggest a different child isoenzyme. The phrasing is a safe synonym for macro alkaline phosphatase. Hence, the substance concept for macro alkaline phosphatase is the precise mapping."
47364002,Blood group antigen Ryan (substance),Laboratory inventory: Ryan blood group antigen,"This wording positions the antigen within inventory context but still refers to the substance, the Ryan blood group antigen, and does not imply test outcomes or antibody status. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and 47364002 is the correct code. A broader parent concept would lack the specificity provided by the name Ryan, and sibling antigen concepts would be incorrect. It is not an antibody, reagent product, or finding; it simply identifies the antigen substance."
422438007,Inadequate exercise space (finding),Exercise space inadequate,"This phrasing conveys the same clinical finding: the space designated or available for exercise is not adequate. No extra qualifiers (e.g., where, why, how severe) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 422438007 is the most precise match because it captures inadequacy of exercise space as a finding. Parent categories for environmental or social context findings are overly broad, and sibling concepts involving equipment or safety are not implied. The word order change is a pure synonym that does not add or change attributes, so it remains codable to the same concept."
16214131000119104,Frozen tissue section specimen (specimen),Tissue specimen prepared as frozen section,"The entry states that the specimen is tissue and that its preparation method is a frozen section, precisely aligning with 'Frozen tissue section specimen' in the SNOMED CT Specimen category. It avoids adding site, timing, or procedural intent. Parent concepts (e.g., 'Tissue specimen') do not capture the frozen-section attribute, and sibling concepts for other preparations (e.g., paraffin sections) are not applicable because 'frozen' is explicitly stated."
360110003,Mild or unspecified (qualifier value),Severity: mild or unspecified,"This entry expresses only a severity qualifier, explicitly combining mild and unspecified. No condition, timing, laterality, or cause is introduced. Category: Qualifier value. The exact phrase maps to 360110003 because it denotes the combined classification used when documentation is either mild or lacks a specific severity. It is more precise than selecting the child concept of mild alone or a sibling concept of unspecified alone; broader parents such as generic severity qualifiers are not needed."
465368007,Stress test treadmill (physical object),Stress-testing treadmill apparatus,"This entry uses 'apparatus' to denote the physical equipment, maintaining clear reference to a treadmill purpose-built for stress testing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and SCTID 465368007 captures the object precisely. It avoids procedure semantics and does not add attributes such as timing or severity, making generic treadmill or stress test procedure codes less appropriate."
96302009,Product containing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (product),Therapeutic product: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor,"The entry describes a therapeutic product of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) class. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It matches SCTID 96302009 by representing a product containing this class without adding treatment status, dose, route, or ingredient specifics. Parent general product concepts are too broad, and substance-only concepts are not product-level. Child concepts naming specific statins or combinations are more specific than the class-based product stated here."
413723002,Budgerigar serum protein specific immunoglobulin G antibody measurement (procedure),Chart entry: budgerigar serum protein–specific IgG measurement pending,"This chart entry notes that a measurement of IgG specific to budgerigar serum protein is pending, which maps to SCTID 413723002. The primary concept is the measurement procedure for antigen-specific IgG with a specific antigen. Category: Procedure. The pending status is a workflow detail and does not add result or method attributes. Broader parent codes and sibling codes for other immunoglobulin classes or different antigen types are excluded by the explicit combination of IgG and budgerigar serum protein."
223874003,Devonshire (geographic location),Administrative area: Devonshire,"This phrasing indicates the geographic administrative unit named Devonshire. The SNOMED CT category remains Location, with Devonshire (geographic location) [223874003] as the correct code. Parent administrative regions (England, UK) are broader and inappropriate, and sibling areas (other counties) are mismatches. The 'administrative area' label is a general descriptor and does not introduce non-location attributes."
223834009,Skiros (geographic location),Encounter location: Skiros,"The context is an encounter, but the referenced location is 'Skiros'. The coded concept is the geographic place, fitting the Geographic location (Location) category. SCTID 223834009 most precisely denotes Skiros. No broader region or specific sub-location is indicated, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate."
309292002,Ovarian fluid specimen (specimen),Ovarian fluid collected as specimen,"The statement indicates that fluid from the ovary was collected and treated as a specimen; no collection method or timing is added. This falls under Specimen. SCTID 309292002 is appropriate because the essential attributes (fluid, ovary) are present. Concepts like ovarian aspirate specimen or ovarian cyst fluid would introduce method or subtype not mentioned here."
214452009,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving fall from car in street while boarding or alighting, occupant of tram injured (event)",Patient was a tram occupant injured when a noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involved a fall from a car in the street while getting in/out.,"The entry specifies the injured person role (tram occupant), the accident type (noncollision motor vehicle traffic), the mechanism (fall from a car), the location (street), and the activity (getting in/out as a synonym for boarding/alighting). This exactly aligns with SNOMED CT Event 214452009. A broader parent concept would omit the detailed mechanism and victim role, and sibling concepts such as collision scenarios or falls from different vehicles would be inappropriate. 'Getting in/out' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of boarding/alighting and doesn't add or change attributes."
247839008,Fear of being in a small group (finding),Problem list: fear of being in a small group,"Listed as a problem, the finding remains fear tied specifically to being in a small group, directly aligning with SCTID 247839008. The main medical concept is unaltered and fits the Clinical finding category. Parent concepts (generic fear) lack the small-group specificity, and siblings (e.g., fear of crowd situations) are not appropriate. The problem-list context is semantic framing and does not introduce new attributes."
223864001,Avon (geographic location),Visiting Avon,"The wording names “Avon” as the place being visited and does not include qualifiers about jurisdiction or feature type. In SNOMED CT, this corresponds to Avon (geographic location) [223864001] within the Location hierarchy. Broader parents like Geographic location are insufficiently specific, and children/siblings such as specific Avons or River Avon are not supported. The verb “visiting” adds context without altering the underlying geographic concept."
33980000,Deflagration (physical force),Deflagration event,"The entry denotes an event characterized by deflagration, but adds no extra clinical attributes. The main concept remains the physical force deflagration. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. SCTID 33980000 is the most specific code capturing deflagration as the mechanism. “Event” is a neutral descriptor and does not shift the concept to broader siblings like Explosion, nor to Detonation, which entails supersonic propagation. Thus, 33980000 is appropriate."
1279754004,American Joint Committee on Cancer rpT1b1 (qualifier value),Registry entry: AJCC rpT1b1,"For registry documentation, this entry records AJCC rpT1b1, which corresponds to the recurrent pathologic T1b1 staging descriptor. It is a Qualifier value only, with no site or N/M details. The accurate SNOMED CT code is SCTID 1279754004. Parent qualifiers like rpT1b or rpT1 are overly general, and sibling qualifiers such as pT1b1 or cT1b1 would be incorrect because the entry explicitly specifies the rpT1b1 value."
216383005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, tennis court (environment)",Place of occurrence of poisoning: tennis court.,"By specifying that the poisoning occurred at a tennis court, the entry focuses solely on the environmental location attribute. The exact SNOMED CT concept is Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, tennis court (environment), SCTID 216383005. General parent concepts or different sports venue siblings do not match the explicit tennis court detail. The wording mirrors the fully specified name and is appropriately precise."
261779005,Electrical pattern (physical force),Electrical pattern (physical force),"This entry restates the preferred term with its hierarchy, directly pointing to Electrical pattern (physical force), SCTID 261779005. It adds no attributes beyond the correct category and avoids any specificity such as AC/DC, voltage, or clinical events. Therefore, it is neither too broad (parent electricity concepts) nor too specific (children like Alternating current), and remains the exact concept intended."
12001002,Thionine stain (substance),Thionine staining reagent,"The term explicitly names thionine as a reagent used for staining, i.e., the material itself. Category: Substance. “Staining reagent” is a common synonymic descriptor for laboratory stains and does not add new attributes beyond identifying the substance. More general parents (e.g., Reagent or Stain) lack specificity, and a procedure such as “stained with thionine” would be different because it describes an action rather than the substance."
223560004,Guinea-Bissau (geographic location),State of Guinea-Bissau,"Here, 'state' is used in the sense of nation-state, referring to the same country, Guinea-Bissau. The primary concept is the geographic location of the country. The correct SNOMED category is Geographic location (Location), with SCTID 223560004 as the most precise match. Higher-level parents (e.g., country class) are too general, and sibling concepts like Equatorial Guinea differ. This wording does not introduce a sublocation or administrative division."
445530002,North Ndebele language (qualifier value),Telehealth language: North Ndebele,"The coded concept is North Ndebele language used in telehealth. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and 445530002 (North Ndebele language) is the exact match. The telehealth context is metadata and does not add attributes that would change code selection. A parent like Ndebele language or a sibling like Southern Ndebele language would be less appropriate given the explicit Northern designation."
223515000,North east African country (geographic location),Country of the northeastern portion of Africa,"The entry describes a country located in the northeastern portion of Africa, which is precisely the same concept. Main concept: geographic location; unit type 'country' and regional placement 'northeastern Africa.' SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223515000 is the best fit, with parents being insufficiently specific and named countries representing child concepts. No new attributes (e.g., identity, timeframe) are added."
18946005,Epidural anesthesia (procedure),Epidural anesthesia undertaken.,"The wording shows the performance of epidural anesthesia, a procedural intervention. It fits the SNOMED CT Procedure category and maps to SCTID 18946005. Since no mention of analgesia, spinal approach, combined techniques, vertebral level, or purpose is included, parents are too broad and siblings/children are not supported by the text."
311989004,Thermal agent and radiation (physical force),Thermal agent and radiation recorded as physical force,"The entry indicates that the combined category 'thermal agent and radiation' has been recorded as a physical force. The main concept is the dual physical force grouping, no subtypes or events specified. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. The best match is SCTID 311989004; the parent 'Physical force' lacks specificity, and child/sibling concepts isolating thermal or radiation alone do not match. The documentation phrasing is equivalent and preserves the concept."
223744000,Java (geographic location),Jawa (island),"“Jawa” is the Indonesian name for Java, and adding “(island)” ensures it is a geographic location. This maps to Java (geographic location), SCTID 223744000, under the Geographic location category. No additional attributes are present. It does not refer to any province (e.g., Jawa Barat/West Java), avoiding child concepts. It is not a broader area, avoiding parent concepts. Thus, this synonym is clinically equivalent and the most precise match."
169732009,Fetal size accords with dates (finding),Fetal size matches gestational dates.,"The phrase asserts that the fetus measures what is expected for the given gestational dates, focusing on size-versus-dates agreement without adding modality, cause, or severity. This is a Clinical finding and corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 169732009. Choosing a parent such as an unspecified fetal size finding would lose the concordance detail, and siblings like small/large for dates or growth abnormalities are specifically not stated. “Matches” is an equivalent synonym for “accords,” so code selection remains the same."
223940001,Strathclyde (geographic location),Strathclyde (geographic location),"This entry explicitly states that Strathclyde is a geographic location, aligning directly with the SNOMED CT concept Strathclyde (geographic location) [223940001]. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. Adding the parenthetical descriptor does not change the meaning or introduce attributes; it clarifies the semantic type. More general concepts (e.g., Scotland) would be overly broad, and related siblings (e.g., Glasgow) are different places. Therefore, the given SCTID is the most precise match."
275119001,Family history: Low vision (situation),Family history reviewed: low vision present.,"This documentation note indicates that the family history has been reviewed and includes low vision, capturing the situation context precisely. It aligns with SNOMED CT 275119001. No extra attributes are introduced, and the concept is narrower than parent categories like family history of ocular disease. Sibling concepts (e.g., family history of macular degeneration) are not implied."
708408009,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Proteus mirabilis (substance),Documentation note: Proteus mirabilis DNA,"The phrase indicates that the note references Proteus mirabilis DNA, keeping the core concept as the organism-specific DNA substance without additional qualifiers or clinical findings. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It best matches 708408009. Parent categories are overly broad; siblings (RNA or other species) are different substances. The contextual wording does not alter the semantic identity of the substance."
297320007,Harari language (qualifier value),Education materials in Harari,"The entry specifies that educational materials are in Harari, identifying the language qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the correct code is Harari language (qualifier value) 297320007. Using a parent Language concept would be non-specific, and siblings (other languages) would be incorrect. The phrase does not imply translation status, literacy level, or interpreter needs; it solely selects Harari as the language."
773451003,Psychotherapy care plan (record artifact),Mental health psychotherapy care plan,"This text frames the care plan within mental health yet remains specific to psychotherapy, not encompassing psychiatry or pharmacotherapy. It refers to the plan document, fitting the Record artifact category. The code 773451003 is the best match, as it precisely captures a psychotherapy-focused care plan. A generic mental health care plan would be broader; a procedure concept (psychotherapy session) would be incorrect. The inclusion of “mental health” is contextual and does not introduce additional attributes that change the code."
294087007,Allergy to oxitropium (finding),Allergy flag: oxitropium,"The entry denotes an allergy flag on oxitropium, meaning the patient has an allergy to that substance, with no other attributes given. This is a Clinical finding. The most precise code is Allergy to oxitropium (finding) SCTID 294087007 because the allergen is clearly specified. Broader categories such as Drug allergy would be less specific, and adverse reaction concepts would misrepresent the stated allergy. The ‘flag’ terminology indicates EHR status but does not alter the underlying medical concept."
216131006,Fall while on board aircraft (event),Incident: fall on board aircraft,Labeling the occurrence as an incident still describes the same event—a fall on board an aircraft—best coded as SNOMED CT 216131006 (Event). The onboard setting ensures it is not a generic fall or a fall from aircraft. 'Incident' is contextual language and does not introduce new attributes that would shift coding. The term remains semantically equivalent to the preferred concept.
404933001,Berg balance test (procedure),Berg Balance Scale undertaken,"The entry denotes that the Berg Balance Scale was undertaken, identifying the specific standardized balance procedure without adding results or other qualifiers. This belongs to the Procedure category in SNOMED CT and maps to Berg balance test (procedure), SCTID 404933001. A parent concept such as general balance assessment would lack instrument specificity, and siblings like Timed Up and Go or Tinetti refer to different tests. The verb “undertaken” is a synonym indicating performance of the same procedure and preserves the code."
259272002,Propyl formate (substance),Identified substance is propyl formate,"The content specifies propyl formate as the identified substance, with no added attributes such as concentration, hazard, or clinical relationship. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance and matches Propyl formate (substance), SCTID 259272002. Parent concepts (e.g., formate esters) are too broad, and sibling substances (e.g., isopropyl formate) differ chemically. The wording confirms the same substance without changing semantic scope."
87251002,4-methoxyamphetamine (substance),Analyte name: 4-methoxyamphetamine,"The main concept is the substance 4-methoxyamphetamine, listed as an analyte name without any assertion of detection, concentration, or test outcome. This keeps the entry squarely within the Substance category. The code SCTID 87251002 matches the precise compound. Choosing an observable/finding concept (e.g., ‘presence of 4-methoxyamphetamine’) would be inappropriate because no result is stated. Parent concepts such as ‘amphetamine’ or non-positional ‘methoxyamphetamine’ are overly broad, and sibling isomers do not apply given the explicit 4-methoxy identification. No product or salt form is implied."
174018004,Enterotomy and endoscopic examination of ileum (procedure),Ileal endoscopic examination via enterotomy,"This entry states an endoscopic exam of the ileum and specifies the access via enterotomy, meeting the combined procedure definition. SNOMED CT category is Procedure. No extraneous attributes (biopsy, therapy, timing, etiology) are introduced. Parent or sibling concepts that lack one component or add different access or additional actions would be less accurate, so SCTID 174018004 is the precise selection."
250890002,Short increment sensitivity index test (procedure),Short increment sensitivity index test—audiology,"This is the SISI test with an added context label of audiology, preserving the exact procedure identity. No laterality, timing, or outcome is included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The correct code is 250890002 for the SISI test. Parent concepts like general audiology assessments are too broad, and sibling procedures are distinct tests; thus the specific SISI code is preferred. The appended context 'audiology' does not alter the procedure semantics."
1287022004,Nottingham scoring system for primary malignant neoplasm of breast score 2 (qualifier value),Nottingham score value 2 in primary malignant breast neoplasm.,"This phrasing reports the value 2 for the Nottingham scoring system pertaining to a primary malignant breast neoplasm. Main concept: Nottingham score 2 for primary breast cancer. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 1287022004 aligns precisely with the qualifier value for this score. The statement does not introduce component details or overall grade, so child or sibling concepts (e.g., tubule formation score 2 or Nottingham grade 2) would be less appropriate. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term, preserving the code selection."
1172397006,Alveolar ridge preservation (procedure),Socket-preservation (alveolar ridge) procedure,"This entry clearly identifies socket preservation specific to the alveolar ridge, synonymous with alveolar ridge preservation, and avoids technique, material, or timing details. It is a Procedure, and SCTID 1172397006 matches exactly. Parent concepts would be imprecise, and siblings such as ridge augmentation or alveoloplasty are different interventions. The synonym does not alter the clinical meaning or code assignment."
430856003,Tissue section (specimen),Pathology specimen is a tissue section,"This contextual entry indicates in pathology documentation that the specimen type is a tissue section, directly aligning with Tissue section (specimen) 430856003. It avoids specifying organ of origin, acquisition procedure, or processing attributes. The category is Specimen (Physical object). Broader parent concepts or technique-specific siblings would be inappropriate because the wording only names a tissue section. The wording is a contextual statement without altering the underlying specimen type."
26830008,Crenosoma canadensis (organism),Documented species: Crenosoma canadensis,"This entry documents the species Crenosoma canadensis, establishing the organism as the main concept. It aligns with the Organism category in SNOMED CT, mapping to SCTID 26830008. The phrase does not add clinical attributes like host or disease, so disorder/finding concepts are unnecessary. Parent concepts (genus or higher taxa) would lose specificity, and sibling species would not match. The descriptor 'documented species' is equivalent in referential meaning and does not alter the code."
280209005,Structure of division of trigeminal nerve (body structure),Examined structure: trigeminal nerve division,"This indicates that the anatomical entity under examination is the division of the trigeminal nerve, with no additional pathological attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Structure of division of trigeminal nerve (SCTID 280209005). Referencing examination status does not change the underlying anatomy. It avoids mapping to the parent (entire trigeminal nerve) or to child structures (specific named divisions) by remaining generic."
431871005,Plain X-ray of lumbar spine using mobile image intensifier (procedure),Lumbar spine plain radiograph performed with a mobile image intensifier,"This wording indicates a radiographic exam ('plain radiograph') of the lumbar spine done using a mobile image intensifier. The concept type is Procedure. It maps precisely to SCTID 431871005 because it includes site (lumbar spine), modality (plain radiograph/X-ray), and equipment (mobile image intensifier). More general parents omit the equipment detail, while siblings for different modalities (e.g., fluoroscopy) or locations (e.g., whole spine) would be incorrect. 'Plain radiograph' is synonymous with 'plain X-ray' and does not alter the code selection."
168138009,Gastric lavage aspirate specimen (specimen),Stomach lavage aspirate specimen,"The entry specifies a specimen from the stomach (gastric) obtained via lavage aspirate, which directly matches the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Parent concepts such as “Stomach specimen” or “Gastric specimen” are too general, while siblings like “Stomach aspirate specimen” lack the lavage distinction. The wording is confined to the specimen type and does not introduce unrelated attributes, so it maps precisely."
788630002,Product containing vasopressin receptor agonist (product),AVP receptor agonist medication product,"AVP (arginine vasopressin) receptor agonist is a clinically equivalent synonym for vasopressin receptor agonist, and the wording specifically says “medication product,” which denotes a medicinal product by class. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. SCTID 788630002 Product containing vasopressin receptor agonist (product) is the exact fit. Using the AVP abbreviation does not change the concept. Parent products would be too general, and child concepts tied to specific active substances or dose forms are not stated. Antagonist siblings are ruled out by the clear “agonist” descriptor."
441765008,Time of induction of anesthesia (observable entity),Time at induction of anesthesia,"The phrase denotes the specific time-at-event for induction within an anesthetic, which is exactly the observable entity defined by Time of induction of anesthesia (SCTID 441765008). It does not introduce related but distinct events such as anesthesia start time, intubation time, or maintenance time, nor does it describe the induction procedure itself. As an observable entity, this is a data capture field and the wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
217154006,"Fall on same level from slipping, tripping or stumbling (event)",Clinician note: fall from standing height after tripping.,"This note indicates a fall from standing height, which is synonymous with same-level, and identifies tripping as the cause. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the description exactly fits 'Fall on same level from slipping, tripping or stumbling (event)'. A broader fall concept would omit mechanism, and 'fall from height' or 'trip without fall' are not applicable. 'Standing height' is a clinically accepted paraphrase for same-level fall, keeping the code selection precise."
113389001,Actinobacillus minor (organism),Species: Actinobacillus minor,"This entry presents the species name Actinobacillus minor under a species header, indicating taxonomic classification. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It precisely matches the species-level concept and does not imply presence, disease, or other attributes. Parent genus concepts are too general, while strain-specific children or disease entities would add attributes absent here. The term 'Species' is a neutral classifier."
1290211006,Space accident (event),Confirmed: space accident,"‘Confirmed’ is a documentation qualifier indicating certainty, not an attribute like cause or severity. The concept remains a space accident. SNOMED CT category: Event. The exact code Space accident (event) [1290211006] fits best; parent or sibling concepts introducing other contexts or mechanisms would be inappropriate given the wording."
731488001,Entire lumbar region of abdominal wall (body structure),Lumbar abdominal wall—entire region,"The entry uses 'lumbar abdominal wall' as a synonym for 'lumbar region of abdominal wall' and adds 'entire region' to capture totality. Attributes: structure (abdominal wall), region (lumbar), totality (entire). This maps to SNOMED CT 731488001 (Body structure). Without 'entire,' it would suit the parent concept; with 'entire,' it is the precise match. It does not imply laterality or non-lumbar regions, avoiding child/sibling mappings."
787920005,Vitamin B2 and/or vitamin B2 derivative (substance),Nutrition entry: B2 vitamin and/or B2 derivative (substance),"This nutrition-focused line documents the substance as B2 vitamin or a B2 derivative while explicitly tagging it as a substance, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps to SCTID 787920005 since it refers to vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and its derivatives as a group. A child concept such as riboflavin alone would exclude derivatives, and a parent concept like “vitamin” would be too broad. The synonym “B2 vitamin” is clinically equivalent to “vitamin B2.”"
415854005,Yersinia enterocolitica non-serogroupable (organism),"Taxonomic designation: Yersinia enterocolitica, non-serogroupable","The entry frames the organism name as a taxonomic designation and adds the attribute non-serogroupable, which is exactly the property in the concept. This is an Organism category term mapping to 415854005. No test result, specimen, or clinical condition is asserted, keeping it within organism taxonomy. The broader parent Yersinia enterocolitica (organism) lacks the specific serogroupability detail; serogroup-specific siblings do not match because the serogroup cannot be assigned."
1290301002,International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grading system for carcinoma of uterine corpus (staging scale),Oncology report: graded according to FIGO (uterine corpus carcinoma) [scale cited],"This oncology report line indicates grading performed according to FIGO for uterine corpus carcinoma, explicitly citing the scale rather than a grade number. The category is Qualifier value — Staging scale. Generic FIGO grading without site, or FIGO systems for other sites, would be less precise, and grade values would be child concepts not included here. The paraphrase conveys the same concept and supports the specific SCTID."
12309006,"Posterior nasal fricative, function (observable entity)",Acoustic analysis parameter: posterior nasal fricative function,"In an acoustic report context, the named parameter remains the posterior nasal fricative function, which is an Observable entity. The context does not change the target concept; it still refers to the functional observable rather than a diagnostic conclusion or procedure code. The wording is more specific than generic acoustic parameters and avoids mapping to anterior or nonspecific nasal fricatives, supporting 12309006."
105578003,Loan foreclosure status (social concept),Loan foreclosure status documented in social history,"This entry indicates the documentation location (social history) for the loan foreclosure status, keeping the focus on the status itself. The main concept is loan foreclosure status as a social context item. The SNOMED CT category is Social concept. Code 105578003 is appropriate because it captures a social-status attribute tied to foreclosure, not a clinical finding or event. Broader parents (e.g., social history general items) are too nonspecific, and more specific siblings (e.g., pending foreclosure, completed foreclosure) introduce details absent here. The contextual phrase 'documented in social history' does not change the concept."
116087001,Cilostazol (substance),Substance: cilostazol,"The entry explicitly categorizes cilostazol as a substance, with no added details about products, dosing, route, or clinical findings. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; therefore, Cilostazol (substance) [116087001] is the precise code. Parent or sibling concepts related to product forms or therapeutic use are less suitable given the absence of those attributes."
411961001,Rumex acetosella specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Rumex acetosella specific allergen test extract (diagnostic),"The phrase indicates a species-specific allergen test extract for diagnostic use and names Rumex acetosella, fully aligning with the diagnostic product intent. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). This maps correctly to SCTID 411961001. Parent concepts without species identification are too general, therapeutic extract siblings imply treatment rather than diagnosis, and substance concepts do not capture the prepared diagnostic extract product."
258583001,Bone marrow clot specimen (specimen),Marrow clot specimen,"Main concept: a specimen of clot derived from marrow, which clinically refers to bone marrow in this context. No collection method, preparation state, or other attributes are added. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This wording is a synonym for Bone marrow clot specimen (SCTID 258583001). It is more precise than the parent Bone marrow specimen and avoids misclassification to siblings such as aspirate or biopsy specimens, which would introduce method or tissue differences not stated."
35313001,"Skilled nursing facility, level 4 care (environment)",Level 4 care setting—skilled nursing facility,"By stating 'level 4 care setting' and specifying 'skilled nursing facility,' the entry denotes the exact environment and care level. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This is the most precise match for SCTID 35313001; broader SNF environment codes miss the level, while other settings (e.g., nursing home) or levels would be incorrect. No extraneous attributes are introduced."
227782007,Cauliflower and vegetable bhaji (substance),Encounter note food item: cauliflower and vegetable bhaji,"The concept is the same named dish, documented as a food item in an encounter note. SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 227782007 remains the best match. Parent classes are general and less specific, and siblings representing only one component (cauliflower or bhaji) are not suitable. The context does not add clinical qualifiers—no timing, amount, or preparation details are included."
442651000124102,Adult formula (product),Adult feeding formula,"The concept described is a formula product intended for feeding adults. No route, flavor, or disease-focused qualifiers are included. Category: Product. 'Feeding formula' is synonymous with 'formula' as a nutrition product, and specifying 'adult' makes Adult formula (product) the correct code. Parent concepts are too broad, and children/siblings that specify enteral-only or pediatric use are not supported by the wording."
426089001,Actinocorallia herbida (organism),Organism: Actinocorallia herbida,"This format identifies the organism explicitly as Actinocorallia herbida, with no other attributes stated. The main concept is the species, appropriately coded to the SNOMED CT Organism category as SCTID 426089001. The contextual label 'Organism:' does not introduce clinical findings or disorders, and more general or alternative taxonomic concepts are less accurate than the exact species listed."
727909003,Entire internal carotid-posterior communicating artery zone (body structure),Vascular zone at the ICA–PCoA junction (entire),"This phrasing identifies the complete vascular zone surrounding the ICA–PCoA junction, avoiding the narrower concept of the junction point itself. It is a Body structure and matches SCTID 727909003. Parent concepts like general vascular regions or ICA structures are too broad, and siblings such as other ICA branch zones are different. “Vascular zone” and “entire” are clinically equivalent descriptors of the same anatomical entity, leaving the code unchanged."
309978002,"Ear, nose and throat department (environment)",Attending department: Otolaryngology,"The named entity is the otolaryngology department, equivalent to the ear, nose and throat department environment. It fits the SNOMED CT Environment or geographical location category and maps to SCTID 309978002. The phrase does not specify clinic, ward, outpatient, or inpatient qualifiers, so more specialized child or sibling concepts are not appropriate. The contextual term 'Attending department:' does not change the underlying environment concept."
1373910006,Nicotinamide riboside (substance),Named molecule: nicotinamide riboside,"This describes nicotinamide riboside as the named molecule, consistent with a Substance concept. The most precise SNOMED CT code is Nicotinamide riboside (substance) [1373910006]. No attributes such as salt form, pharmaceutical product, dosage, or clinical findings are present, so alternative hierarchies or related concepts are not appropriate."
70551000052102,Enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (qualifier value),Analytical technique—EMIT,"This states the analytical technique is EMIT, with no mention of analyte, specimen, or results. In SNOMED CT, the concept is a Qualifier value and maps precisely to Enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (SCTID 70551000052102). Parent concepts like Immunoassay technique are too broad, and sibling techniques (ELISA, RIA) represent different formats. EMIT remains a clinically equivalent synonym for the named technique."
442508008,Mercaptamine hydrochloride (substance),API name: mercaptamine hydrochloride,"The concept is the active pharmaceutical ingredient mercaptamine hydrochloride. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. 'API' indicates role but does not alter the substance identity, making SCTID 442508008 the precise code. No dose, route, or formulation is included, so medicinal product or preparation codes are not appropriate. Parent base compound or alternate salts are excluded because the hydrochloride salt is explicitly identified."
309072003,Soft tissue specimen (specimen),Follow-up: soft tissue specimen,"In follow-up documentation, the presence of a soft tissue specimen is noted without any qualifiers regarding collection method, site, preparation, or results. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the correct code is 309072003 Soft tissue specimen. Parent concepts would be overly broad, and children specifying biopsy or site details would be too narrow and not reflected in the wording. The follow-up context does not alter the specimen type."
223883008,Hereford and Worcester (geographic location),Geographic locality: Hereford and Worcester,"The value “Hereford and Worcester” is a geographic locality and maps directly to the named location. The label is contextual and does not specify residence, travel, or other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographical location). Code 223883008 is the most specific match; broader parents would be imprecise and no narrower child (such as sub-areas) is indicated. The phrasing is a safe synonym that retains identical meaning."
310207003,Sheltered housing (environment),Sheltered accommodation,"This entry uses a common synonym for sheltered housing, focusing on the accommodation environment. The main concept is the living environment being sheltered accommodation. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The phrase is clinically equivalent to sheltered housing and does not add severity, cause, or care-level attributes. Parent concepts like housing (environment) are too general, and siblings such as assisted living or care home would misrepresent the environment. Thus, SCTID 310207003 is the most precise match."
350312004,Product containing salicylate (product),Salicylate-containing medicine,"The phrase identifies a medicine that contains a salicylate class ingredient, without specifying which salicylate, a dose, a route, or exclusivity. It is in the Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product) category and maps to Product containing salicylate (product), SCTID 350312004. Using 'medicine' instead of 'product' is a clinically safe synonym that keeps the focus on the medicinal product. Child concepts naming particular salicylates (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid) or product forms would be too specific given the neutral wording."
24981001,Structure of superior rectal plexus (body structure),Superior rectal plexus anatomy,"This phrasing treats the entry as an anatomical term referring to the structure itself. It is a Body structure with precise match SCTID 24981001. The wording does not introduce disease, timing, laterality, or extent, and therefore does not require a parent 'rectal plexus' nor any child branch concept. The synonym remains fully equivalent to the preferred term."
258537007,Surface swab (specimen),Surface swab recorded as specimen type,"This describes the recorded specimen type as a surface swab, aligning directly with 'Surface swab (specimen)' SCTID 258537007 in the Specimen hierarchy. No location or procedural attributes are added. Parent swab specimens lack the 'surface' specificity, and child/sibling concepts tied to anatomical or environmental sites are not suggested by the entry."
702658000,Microbial culture technique (qualifier value),Microbiologic culture technique,"The entry uses 'microbiologic' as a recognized synonym of 'microbiological/microbial' and indicates the technique as a culture method for microorganisms. No additional attributes (specimen, organism subtype, culture conditions) are present. This is a technique qualifier, not a procedure. The best SNOMED CT match is the Qualifier value 702658000 Microbial culture technique. A parent technique concept would be non-specific, and sibling or child technique concepts would introduce specificity not stated. The synonym is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
705106004,No abnormality of fetal heart detected (situation),No fetal heart malformation detected,"The entry indicates that no malformation of the fetal heart was detected, which is consistent with the broader statement of no abnormality detected in the fetal heart. Main concept: fetal heart; attribute: negative detection. Category: Situation with explicit context. 'Malformation' is a subset term often used for structural anomalies, but here it is framed within 'no ... detected' without specifying a structural-only focus; it remains equivalent to the general absence of abnormality. Using a more specific sibling like 'no structural abnormality' would over-specify the wording, and parents would be too general. SCTID 705106004 is appropriate."
396476009,Specimen from liver obtained by right lobectomy (specimen),Right-lobe liver lobectomy specimen,"This indicates a specimen from the liver tied to a lobectomy of the right lobe. The main concept is a specimen and fits the Specimen category. The phrasing 'right-lobe ... lobectomy specimen' conveys right lobectomy provenance without adding other attributes. A general liver specimen would be a parent and less specific, while left lobectomy specimens are siblings and do not match. The surgical procedure concept should not be selected because the text pertains to the specimen, not the operation."
106790007,Family Tabanidae (organism),Biological family Tabanidae,"“Biological family Tabanidae” denotes the organism at the family taxonomic rank and maps to SNOMED CT 106790007. The main concept is the family Tabanidae, and the SNOMED category is Organism. The entry does not introduce any clinical context such as bite, exposure, or disease association; it is strictly the taxonomic label. Parent or sibling families would not match the explicit naming of Tabanidae, and genus/species-level children are not intended here. The synonym is equivalent to the preferred term since it preserves rank and identity."
251634004,"Bereitschafts potential, function (observable entity)",Bereitschafts potential functional measure,"Describing it as a “functional measure” indicates the observable functional property associated with the readiness potential, not the test procedure or an interpretive finding. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 251634004 is the most accurate match for the function of the Bereitschafts potential. Parent concepts like general EEG measures or sibling concepts implying abnormal RP are less suitable because the entry remains specific to RP function and does not introduce result attributes. The wording is a semantically equivalent paraphrase of the functional observable."
771192005,Bite of venomous arthropod (event),Mechanism: venomous arthropod bite,The entry captures the mechanism of the incident—bite by a venomous arthropod—without other clinical attributes. This is an Event. It matches Bite of venomous arthropod (event) because it specifies both 'bite' and 'venomous arthropod'. A generic parent (arthropod bite) is less precise; a sting sibling is incorrect; species-specific children are more detailed than the text supports. 'Mechanism' is contextual labeling and does not alter the semantic core of the event.
399308006,Lindblom projection (qualifier value),Patient statement: “They did the Lindblom view.”,"A patient-reported phrase that names the Lindblom view refers to the same radiographic projection, aligning with Lindblom projection (qualifier value), SCTID 399308006. The SNOMED category is Qualifier value. The entry avoids specifying anatomy, laterality, or cause, maintaining focus on the projection technique. Parent qualifiers are less specific, and siblings (other named views) are not referenced. The synonym “view” is standard and clinically equivalent to “projection.”"
224036001,Victoria island (geographic location),Victoria Island,"The main concept referenced is the named place Victoria Island, which is a geographic location. No clinical attributes (severity, laterality, causation) are introduced; the entry is a plain place name. In SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location concept, and 224036001 Victoria island (geographic location) is the most precise match because the wording exactly matches the named island. Using a parent like Island (geographic location) would be too generic, and child or sibling variants specifying a particular country or district are not stated here. The capitalization difference between the SNOMED preferred term and the entry is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not change code selection."
445340000,Yellow-green optical filter of optical microscope (physical object),Yellow-green optical filter of optical microscope,"The main concept is a yellow-green optical filter that is a component of an optical microscope, which is a physical object. In SNOMED CT, this maps most precisely to the physical object concept SCTID 445340000, “Yellow-green optical filter of optical microscope.” Parent concepts such as “Optical filter of optical microscope” or “Optical microscope component” are too general because they do not specify the yellow-green color attribute. Sibling concepts that denote other filter colors (e.g., blue or green) would be incorrect. The wording introduces no extra attributes (e.g., wavelength, bandpass, usage), and thus remains an exact synonym of the designated physical object."
707819003,On menstrual cycle day 21 (qualifier value),Entry recorded as day 21 of menstrual cycle.,"This expresses the recorded timing as day 21 within the menstrual cycle, a Qualifier value. SCTID 707819003 precisely encodes ‘On menstrual cycle day 21.’ Parent concepts lacking day specificity or sibling values for other days are less appropriate. The statement does not introduce other attributes and remains a pure timing qualifier."
10035008,Low altitude (physical force),Low-elevation setting,"This describes a setting with low elevation, using 'elevation' as a synonym for altitude, and corresponds to Low altitude (physical force) [SCTID: 10035008]. Category: Physical force. The synonym does not alter code selection. A general altitude parent would lack specificity, and High altitude would be incorrect. No exact level is provided, so the low-altitude physical force is the best match."
392004000,Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (physical object),Imaging device: confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope,"In an imaging report context, the item labeled is the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope as the imaging device. Category: Physical object (Device). It maps precisely to SCTID 392004000 and is distinct from procedural codes (e.g., confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy) or broader device categories. The contextual label 'Imaging device:' does not introduce new attributes; it simply indicates the device used."
328701000,Gluten-free cannelloni (product),Avoid regular cannelloni; use gluten-free cannelloni,The instruction contrasts standard cannelloni with its gluten-free counterpart and specifies the gluten-free cannelloni product to use. This aligns with the Product category and maps precisely to SCTID 328701000. The wording introduces no additional attributes beyond gluten-free and cannelloni form. Parent “Cannelloni (product)” and sibling “Gluten-free pasta (product)” are less precise than the specified gluten-free cannelloni concept.
410580001,Respiratory fluid specimen (specimen),Respiratory fluid specimen pending analysis,"This indicates a specimen consisting of respiratory fluid awaiting analysis, which remains within the Specimen category. The wording aligns with respiratory fluid specimen, favoring SCTID 410580001. No specific subtype is mentioned, so child concepts are not warranted, and a broader parent would lose necessary respiratory context. Swab specimens are a different material class and are not suggested here."
294819000,Allergy to triptorelin (finding),Documented drug allergy to triptorelin,"This explicitly identifies a drug allergy to the precise agent triptorelin, with an emphasis on documentation but no added clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT match is Allergy to triptorelin (finding), SCTID 294819000. 'Drug allergy' is used as a contextual header, not as a broader code, because the specific substance is named. Sibling concepts like allergy to other GnRH analogs or adverse drug reaction terms do not fit the wording."
343823004,Entire primitive sex cord (body structure),Mapping target: primitive sex cord,"This indicates that the coding/mapping target is the primitive sex cord, directly aligning with the body structure concept SCTID 343823004. Main concept: primitive sex cord. Category: Body structure. The mapping context is nonclinical and does not alter the anatomical meaning. Parent concepts lack the primitive qualifier, and no narrower subtype is specified."
440137008,Specimen obtained by peritoneal lavage (specimen),Specimen source: peritoneal washings,"This entry specifies the source of the specimen as peritoneal washings, synonymous with peritoneal lavage. The concept is a specimen obtained via wash from the peritoneal cavity; attributes include site and method. Category: Specimen. SCTID 440137008 is the most precise mapping. Broader parents without site detail or siblings for other washings (e.g., bronchial) would not match, and peritoneal fluid collected without washing would be a different specimen concept."
418908004,Exposure to electric current (event),Seen for exposure to electric current,"The entry indicates the individual was seen for an exposure to electric current; the underlying concept remains an exposure event without injury or context qualifiers. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Event category and specifically to 418908004 (Exposure to electric current). Alternatives like Electric shock or Electrocution would require explicit injury findings, and Accidental or Occupational exposure would need those qualifiers. The care context (‘seen for’) does not alter the concept or necessitate a different code."
765226004,Occupational exposure to extreme temperature (event),Patient statement: “My job exposes me to extreme temperatures.”,"The patient-like phrasing expresses an exposure event tied to job duties, with the factor being extreme temperatures. Category is Event. Occupational exposure to extreme temperature (SCTID 765226004) is the most precise concept because the occupational context is explicit. There is no specification of heat vs cold or any resultant condition, so child concepts would not fit. The phrasing is a natural-language synonym of the preferred term without altering attributes."
702864009,Headache clinic (environment),Headache clinic,"The entry names the specific care environment: a headache clinic. The main concept is the physical/organizational clinical setting designated for headache care, without implying any action, encounter, or service request. SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The exact phrase matches the concept Headache clinic (environment) SCTID 702864009. Broader parents like Clinic (environment) are less precise, and siblings such as Pain clinic (environment) or Neurology clinic (environment) do not match the explicitly headache-focused clinic. No procedural or finding semantics are introduced, so encounter or referral concepts are inappropriate."
112634003,Structure of autoimplant (body structure),Follow-up review topic: autoimplant structure,"This follow-up context names the autoimplant structure as the topic, referring to the Body structure explicitly. It aligns with “Structure of autoimplant” (SCTID: 112634003). No attributes such as status, complications, or location are added, so the concept does not shift to findings or procedure codes. The autologous implant specificity makes parents like “Structure of implant” too broad and sibling structures for alloimplants/grafts inappropriate."
765387007,Hydroquinidine (substance),Hydroquinidine (ingredient),"The entry explicitly frames hydroquinidine as an ingredient, aligning with the Substance concept and avoiding dose, product, or salt form details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Hydroquinidine (substance) SCTID 765387007 is the correct code. Parent groupings and sibling salt/product concepts would not fit given the absence of those attributes."
440949008,Thermomonas brevis (organism),Organism: Thermomonas brevis species,"The concept explicitly identifies Thermomonas brevis as an organism at the species level, without any clinical modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This aligns with 440949008. Parent genus-level or broader organism categories would be less specific, and no indication of infection, site, timing, or strain is present, avoiding child or sibling disorder codes. The phrasing remains a clinically equivalent synonym for the species organism."
20859003,Structure of fetal spaces (body structure),Fetal spaces (body structure),"This entry explicitly frames 'fetal spaces' as a body structure, matching the anatomy-only scope without added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps best to SCTID 20859003 because it refers to the collective anatomical spaces in the fetus. It does not point to any specific substructure (child) nor to a broader fetal anatomy parent, keeping the granularity consistent with the concept."
1359916007,Entire anterior orbital gyrus (body structure),Brain map region named the entire anterior orbital gyrus,"The entry denotes the named brain map region as the whole anterior orbital gyrus, strictly an anatomical specification. This maps to SNOMED CT Body structure SCTID 1359916007 due to explicit inclusion of ‘entire.’ The mapping remains anatomical and not to a function or finding. Parent terms without the whole-structure qualifier and other gyri or cortex labels are less appropriate, since the exact entirety of the anterior orbital gyrus is specified."
1365828005,Photographic intraoral direct left lateral view image in centric relation displaying overjet (record artifact),Chart image: intraoral direct left lateral photographic view in centric relation that displays overjet.,"The chart entry includes all essential features: intraoral direct photography, left lateral view, centric relation, and displayed overjet. Main concept: record artifact type. Category: Record artifact. The code 1365828005 is the most precise match; a parent would be too generic, and siblings differing in laterality, occlusal position, or technique would be inaccurate."
264902005,Particulate matter in synovial fluid (qualifier value),Report section title: synovial fluid particulate matter,"Used as a section title, this entry identifies the attribute 'particulate matter' of synovial fluid and does not state presence or quantity. It should be coded as a Qualifier value, specifically 'Particulate matter in synovial fluid' (264902005). Parent concepts lack the synovial context, siblings pertain to other properties, and children would name specific particulates, none of which are conveyed here."
736366004,Advance care plan (record artifact),Chart contains an advance care plan,"This states the chart contains the advance care plan, indicating the presence of the record artifact without specifying any directive type or planning process. The category is Record artifact. SCTID 736366004 is the best match because it denotes the plan document. Generic parent record artifacts are too broad, and directive-specific siblings (DNR, living will, POLST) are not implied."
301750006,Unable to perform management and supervisory activities (finding),Unable to perform management and supervisory activities.,"The entry explicitly states an inability to perform management and supervisory activities, which is the exact clinical finding encoded by SNOMED CT 301750006. The main concept is an absolute functional inability regarding the specific domain of management and supervisory activities, with no added attributes such as cause, severity, or timing. The SNOMED category is Clinical finding. This matches precisely, whereas broader parent concepts like generic inability to perform activities would be less specific, and sibling concepts indicating difficulty (not inability) or different activity domains would be inaccurate. The wording mirrors the preferred term, maintaining clinical equivalence without introducing new qualifiers."
216407009,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, office building (environment)",Office block recorded as place of occurrence,"“Office block” is a commonly used synonym for office building and denotes the location of an accident or poisoning, matching SNOMED CT Environment concept 216407009. No additional attributes are introduced. A broader parent concept would be less specific, and sibling locations (home, school, industrial site) are not implied. The synonym does not change the intended environment, so the office building place-of-occurrence code is the most accurate."
118361001,Visible laser light (physical force),Visible laser light observed,"This expresses observation of the physical agent 'visible laser light' without adding causality or exposure semantics. The category is Physical force. It maps exactly to Visible laser light (118361001). Using the broader Laser light would lose the visible specificity, and choosing other wavelength siblings would contradict the stated visible range."
264158003,Entire posterior recess of tympanic membrane (body structure),Structure identified: posterior recess of the tympanic membrane,"This entry identifies the anatomical structure as the posterior recess of the tympanic membrane, which implies the full recess. It is a Body structure concept. The best SNOMED CT fit is Entire posterior recess of tympanic membrane (SCTID: 264158003). A general tympanic membrane code is less specific, and a quadrant or different recess would be a mismatch. The wording avoids any added attributes beyond naming the structure."
259591003,Alpha-1-antitrypsin isoform Z (substance),Proteomic library entry: alpha-1-antitrypsin Z isoform,"The phrase identifies the substance as alpha-1-antitrypsin Z isoform within a proteomic library context, which does not change its identity. It is a Substance concept. The correct SNOMED code is SCTID 259591003, Alpha-1-antitrypsin isoform Z (substance). Parent concepts lacking the isoform specification are too general, and no sibling isoform, disorder, or genetic concept is indicated by the wording."
5491000179105,Medical record summary (record artifact),Summary of patient’s medical record (document),"Explicitly identifying it as a document that summarizes the patient’s medical record aligns with Medical record summary (record artifact), classified as a Record artifact. Parent categories are too broad, and sibling artifacts like Referral letter or After-visit summary indicate different contexts. The synonym simply clarifies the artifact form and does not introduce extra attributes, preserving exact code selection."
429231004,Angulomicrobium tetraedrale (organism),Organism name cited: Angulomicrobium tetraedrale,"The entry cites the organism name Angulomicrobium tetraedrale, which designates a specific species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No clinical attributes, sample findings, or strain/subspecies information are provided, making SCTID 429231004 the precise match. A parent concept such as the genus or broader bacterial categories would be less specific, and any child strain concept would be too detailed. The citation context is a clinically equivalent paraphrase and maintains the same code."
287408002,External ear furuncle drained (situation),Outer ear furuncle drained,"This entry specifies a furuncle at the outer/external ear and states it has been drained, with no additional qualifiers. It belongs to the Situation with explicit context category. The exact match is SCTID 287408002 because it is the drained situation of a furuncle on the external ear. More general parents lack site specificity, sibling disorders lack drained context, and procedure codes would imply the action rather than the post-procedure state. The synonym “outer ear” is equivalent to “external ear,” preserving code accuracy."
438833006,Administration of drug or medicament contraindicated (situation),Medication administration contraindicated.,"The entry states that administering medication is contraindicated, with no additional qualifiers. The main concept is a clinical situation where giving any drug or medicament should not occur. SNOMED CT category: Situation. The most precise match is 438833006 Administration of drug or medicament contraindicated (situation) because it explicitly captures that drug administration is contraindicated. Broader parents such as general treatment contraindicated are less specific, and children or siblings that specify a particular product class (e.g., vaccine, contrast, anticoagulant) are not appropriate since no specific agent is named. The wording uses a standard synonym (“medication administration”) that is clinically equivalent to “administration of drug or medicament” without changing the code selection."
469287008,Intrauterine secretion scoop (physical object),Intrauterine secretions scoop,"Using the plural ‘secretions’ does not change the concept; it remains the intrauterine secretion scoop. The category is Physical object. This maps exactly to SNOMED CT 469287008 and not to broader or alternative instruments. No extra features (e.g., size, disposable, manufacturer) are introduced, ensuring the code selection remains precise."
249320000,Form of bridge of nose (observable entity),Configuration of nasal bridge,"The term 'configuration' is a semantic synonym for structural form/shape. Specifying 'nasal bridge' preserves the exact anatomical target, making SCTID 249320000 (Observable entity) the most accurate selection. No assessment result or abnormality is implied, so child/sibling findings are inappropriate. Wider observables concerning the entire nose would be less specific than the bridge-focused attribute."
223603007,Pakistan (geographic location),Geographic location: Pakistan,"This entry presents Pakistan as the geographic location value in a documentation field, with no additional attributes beyond the location itself. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The exact concept is Pakistan (geographic location) SCTID 223603007. Using a parent like Geographic location would be overly broad, and no child location within Pakistan or sibling country is specified. The contextual label does not shift the coding away from the country."
1208369000,Yemen (geographic location),Location recorded as Yemen,"This entry documents the location value, which is Yemen, without adding clinical context. Category: Geographic location. The correct match is Yemen (geographic location) [1208369000]; using a generic parent would lose specificity, and children like city names or regions are not supported. The wording does not imply residence, travel, timing, or clinical associations—it simply states the place."
223881005,Greater Manchester (geographic location),Exposure in Greater Manchester,"Although 'exposure' adds situational context, the referenced entity is the geographic location 'Greater Manchester.' SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). This should not be coded to a broader region like 'North West England' or to a different locality (e.g., 'Salford'), as the phrase clearly names Greater Manchester. The context does not change the target concept; SCTID 223881005 is most precise."
126247001,"Plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced, human (product)",Clinic note: plan to administer human cryoprecipitate-reduced plasma,"Main concept: intended blood product is human cryoprecipitate-reduced plasma; “plan to administer” is context. SNOMED CT category: Product. The component matches the concept SCTID 126247001. Parent plasma terms are nonspecific, while child/sibling concepts like frozen CR plasma or solvent-detergent plasma would add unstated attributes. The wording introduces no attributes beyond cryoprecipitate removal and human origin."
216301009,"Accident caused by being dragged by cable car, not on rails (event)",Non-rail cable car dragging accident.,"This concise entry describes an accident in which a person was dragged by a cable car explicitly labeled as non-rail. The key elements are accident and mechanism “dragging” by a non-rail cable car. Category: Event. SCTID 216301009 is the precise code, reflecting the specified mechanism and the non-rail property. More general cable car accidents lack the mechanism specificity, and siblings like “fall from cable car” or “collision with cable car” are different mechanisms. The entry does not add severity, location, or injury details, so it cleanly maps to the exact SNOMED event concept without drifting to parent or sibling categories."
285204003,Ability to remember today's date (observable entity),Ability to recall today's date,"This entry uses 'recall' as a clinically equivalent synonym for 'remember,' still referencing the same cognitive variable concerning the date on the current day. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, matching SCTID 285204003. Parent concepts like general time orientation or broader memory observables are too general, and sibling concepts that record a positive or negative finding would be inappropriate because the entry does not express a result. 'Recall' is interchangeable with 'remember' in this context and does not change the code selection."
1268867004,Ulmus pumila pollen (substance),Sample annotation: Ulmus pumila pollen,"The phrase indicates an annotation about a sample naming Ulmus pumila pollen, which still refers to the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches Ulmus pumila pollen (substance), SCTID 1268867004, and does not imply results, exposures, or product forms. Parent and sibling concepts are ruled out by the species-specific identification."
219290002,Legal execution (event),Legal carrying out of capital sentence,"Legal carrying out of capital sentence describes the event of enforcing a capital sentence under legal sanction, which corresponds to Legal execution (event) SCTID: 219290002. The core concept is a legally sanctioned execution event; it does not introduce method, timing, or related conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The wording is more specific than general legal intervention concepts and avoids child concepts specifying execution modalities. This is a semantically equivalent paraphrase and supports the same code."
287205001,Brain decortication (procedure),Cerebral decortication,"The entry specifies decortication of the cerebrum, which is clinically synonymous with brain decortication and does not add new attributes. It is a Procedure-type concept in SNOMED CT. SCTID 287205001 Brain decortication is the exact match. A broader parent (e.g., Neurosurgical procedure) would lose specificity, while sibling procedures such as decortication of lung or excision/resection of cortex would diverge from the decortication action or the target organ, confirming 287205001."
717829002,Everyday Memory Questionnaire score (observable entity),EMQ scale score,"This wording refers to the score on the EMQ scale, with the main concept being the EMQ score as an observable entity. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. Everyday Memory Questionnaire score (SCTID 717829002) fits exactly because it identifies the specific instrument’s scoring. The phrase “scale score” is a clinically common synonym for the numerical or derived score of a questionnaire and does not add extra attributes such as subscale designation, values, or interpretation. Broader parent score concepts lack instrument specificity, and siblings tied to other instruments are incorrect."
309277003,Urethra biopsy specimen (specimen),Urethral biopsy specimen,"The phrase clearly denotes a specimen obtained by biopsy from the urethra, with the explicit site (urethra) and specimen type (biopsy) stated. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This is a precise match to the concept Urethra biopsy specimen (SCTID 309277003). Using a broader parent such as a generic urethra specimen or genitourinary biopsy specimen would be less specific, and siblings like urethral swab or urethral excision specimens imply different collection techniques. The wording is a direct synonym and does not introduce any additional attributes beyond site and biopsy-type specimen."
719334000,Unfit for flying (finding),Medical certificate result: unfit to fly,"The entry states the outcome of a medical certification is unfit to fly, without adding cause or timing. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. The explicit reference to flying aligns with SCTID 719334000. Parent concepts that capture general certification outcomes or fitness lack the specific activity, and sibling findings for other modes of activity would be incorrect. The certification context does not change the underlying finding."
411515009,Amalgam patch test substance (product),Patch test component: amalgam,"The text identifies amalgam as a component of a patch test panel, indicating the product used as the test substance. No procedural performance, results, or dose form attributes are specified. SNOMED CT category: Product. The most precise code is “Amalgam patch test substance (product)” 411515009. A general patch test component concept would be too broad, and the entry does not point to other materials or to a testing procedure. “Component” is an acceptable synonym for the specific test substance in a panel."
446377001,Subfamily Anserinae (organism),Reference taxon: Anserinae,"The entry uses a reference label for the taxon Anserinae, preserving its rank. Main concept: organism subfamily Anserinae. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Because the rank is clearly subfamily, SCTID 446377001 is exact, and alternatives at family or tribe/genus ranks are less appropriate. The synonym is semantically equivalent and introduces no attributes."
404286009,Salmonella IIIb 17:z10:z (organism),Reported as Salmonella IIIb 17:z10:z,"This entry records the organism identification as Salmonella IIIb 17:z10:z, mapping to SNOMED CT 404286009 in the Organism hierarchy. Reporting language does not introduce clinical attributes. Broader parents omit the serovar detail, while siblings are different Salmonella IIIb serovars. Therefore, the exact organism concept is the most accurate code for this wording."
697978002,Provider orders for life-sustaining treatment (record artifact),Life-sustaining treatment orders by provider,"The wording identifies provider-authored orders concerning life-sustaining treatment, which is synonymous with the POLST artifact. The main concept is the document; no particular directive is specified. Classified as a Record artifact in SNOMED CT, this entry maps best to SCTID 697978002. Parent record artifact codes lack specificity, and sibling concepts (e.g., DNR documentation or advance directives) would not fit because the entry does not state those narrower or different document types."
236144006,Open stone operation on kidney or renal pelvis (procedure),Open surgical management of kidney/renal pelvis stone,"The phrase denotes open surgical management (an operation) for a stone with site confined to kidney or renal pelvis, without specifying which. This is a Procedure mapped to SCTID 236144006. Parents are too broad (other urinary sites), while children specifying kidney only or renal pelvis only are more granular than the entry intends. Sibling approaches like percutaneous or endoscopic management are excluded by 'open surgical.' The terms 'management' and 'operation' are clinically aligned in this context and do not introduce additional attributes or change the code selection."
367728008,Entire cavernous vein of penis (body structure),Reference structure: cavernous vein of penis,"This entry cites the reference structure as the cavernous vein of the penis, a Body structure. The contextual wording does not change the anatomical target or add attributes, so it aligns with Entire cavernous vein of penis (SCTID: 367728008). Broader parents and alternate sibling veins are excluded by the specificity of 'cavernous' and 'penis.'"
443221000124104,Standard weaning infant formula (product),Routine weaning baby formula,"The concept stated is a product: a routine (i.e., standard) formula used for weaning, with “baby” used as a plain-language synonym for infant. Category: Product. This matches SNOMED CT “Standard weaning infant formula” (443221000124104). The term “routine” is clinically equivalent to “standard” and does not imply specialized composition. More general parents would omit the standard qualifier, while siblings with special features (e.g., thickened or hypoallergenic formulas) are not indicated here. No other attributes are present."
78366005,Environmental force (physical force),Environmental force — physical,"The wording aligns directly with the preferred term and indicates the type hierarchy (physical). The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. The code 78366005 is the exact match for environmental physical force. Choosing a parent (Physical force) would be less precise, and any child or sibling adding subtype (e.g., mechanical, thermal) is inappropriate because no subtype is mentioned."
61071000087104,Antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae Danish serotype 9N capsular polysaccharide conjugated (substance),"Streptococcus pneumoniae Danish serotype 9N capsular polysaccharide antigen, conjugated","The entry explicitly names the antigen from Streptococcus pneumoniae Danish serotype 9N and specifies that the capsular polysaccharide is conjugated, matching the substance concept. Category: Substance. This aligns exactly with SCTID 61071000087104. It is more specific than parent concepts like generic pneumococcal antigen and excludes siblings such as other serotypes (e.g., 9V) or non-conjugated polysaccharides. The phrasing is a direct synonym of the preferred term without adding product or administration attributes."
1290867009,Structure of subcutaneous tissue of left knee (body structure),Specimen source: left knee subcutaneous tissue,"Contextualizing as a specimen source still denotes the same anatomical structure: subcutaneous tissue of the left knee. No pathology or procedural details alter the underlying site and layer. This is a Body structure mapping precisely to SCTID 1290867009. Parent concepts without laterality or siblings targeting other sides or layers (e.g., right knee subcutaneous tissue, left knee skin) would not be as accurate. The wording uses a different context while preserving the exact structure."
223564008,Mauritania (geographic location),Geographic location: Mauritania,"The concept is explicitly a geographic location and names Mauritania, matching Mauritania (geographic location), SCTID 223564008, in the Geographic location hierarchy. The field label clarifies the semantic type without adding attributes such as timing, cause, severity, or specific subareas. Broader parents (Africa, West Africa) and narrower children (cities like Nouakchott) are not invoked. This makes the country-level Mauritania the correct and most specific code."
746051007,Endovascular insertion of drug coated stent (procedure),Drug-coated stent placement via endovascular approach,"This describes the procedural act of placing a drug-coated stent and specifies the endovascular route, matching the key attributes of the concept. It is a SNOMED CT Procedure and corresponds precisely to SCTID 746051007. A parent like generic stent placement lacks the drug-coated detail, while siblings that add vessel site or alternate stent types would introduce attributes not present here. The term “placement” is clinically synonymous with “insertion/deployment,” and does not change the code selection."
1279545000,Presence of high grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia at surgical margin in excised specimen of intrahepatic bile duct (observable entity),Margin shows high-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia in intrahepatic bile duct excision specimen.,"Here, the margin of the intrahepatic bile duct excision specimen is described as showing high-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia, i.e., presence at the surgical margin. The main elements are presence at margin, high-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia, and the intrahepatic bile duct excised specimen. This is an Observable entity representing a margin status observation. It maps exactly because it is not low-grade, not absent, not invasive carcinoma, and the site is intrahepatic bile duct; hence parent or sibling concepts would not be as precise."
73831000,Economic status (social concept),Patient economic status,"This entry explicitly situates the concept as pertaining to the patient, but still refers only to economic status without details. The SNOMED CT category is Social concept, and Economic status (SCTID: 73831000) matches exactly. No added attributes (e.g., low income, affordability issues) are provided, so it should not map to financial hardship or income level. It is not a procedure or an assessment; it simply names the social concept for the patient."
309074002,Soft tissue biopsy specimen (specimen),Specimen: soft tissue biopsy,"This phrasing identifies the type of specimen as a biopsy of soft tissue, maintaining the focus on a specimen rather than the procedure. It conveys the same concept as the preferred term, aligning with the SNOMED CT Specimen hierarchy. Soft tissue biopsy specimen (309074002) is the most precise code because it includes both the source (soft tissue) and the acquisition method (biopsy). A parent like Soft tissue specimen lacks the biopsy attribute, and a generic Biopsy specimen lacks the source. No child site or technique details are introduced, so siblings such as needle core biopsy specimens are not appropriate."
223696006,Panama (geographic location),República de Panamá,"This is the Spanish official designation of the country, which unambiguously points to the same geographic entity. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). It aligns with Panama (geographic location), SCTID 223696006. Parent categories (Country) are too general, while child/sibling terms (Panama City, Costa Rica) are different places. The language variant does not alter the concept or introduce attributes."
262371008,Cristobali (qualifier value),SNOMED qualifier: Cristobalite,Labeling the term as a SNOMED qualifier underscores its hierarchy and matches the qualifier value Cristobali/Cristobalite (SCTID 262371008). No attributes are present beyond the concept name. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The term is specific to cristobalite and does not denote other silica forms or exposures. The synonym remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not alter code selection.
408393003,Under care of retinal screener (finding),Patient under the care of a retinal screener.,"This statement documents the patient’s current care relationship with a retinal screener, aligning precisely with Under care of retinal screener (finding) SCTID 408393003. The main concept is care status with a specified provider role; no additional attributes like condition (e.g., diabetes), frequency, laterality, or severity are introduced. It is a Clinical finding describing the care context. More general parent findings (e.g., Under care of professional) would be less specific, while siblings like Under care of ophthalmologist are inaccurate as the named provider type is a retinal screener. The wording is a clear, semantically equivalent paraphrase that does not alter the intended code."
344738001,Structure of cervical myotome (body structure),Cervical myotomal musculature,"The phrase refers to the musculature that constitutes the cervical myotome, which is synonymous with the anatomical structure of the cervical myotome. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. Concept 344738001 is appropriate because myotomes are defined by the muscle groups innervated by specific spinal segments, and this entry maintains the focus on the cervical region. More general myotome structure concepts lack the cervical specificity, and sibling regional myotomes would be incorrect. The wording does not add attributes such as function, deficits, or specific levels; it remains an anatomical synonym."
35001000087102,Smoking pipe (physical object),Smoking pipe among patient’s personal effects,"This describes a smoking pipe included in personal effects, focusing on the object itself. Category: Physical object. The appropriate code is Smoking pipe (physical object) [35001000087102]. Parent pipe concepts are not specific to smoking, and sibling smoking devices differ. No added attributes like material or timing are present; only context of possession."
242400001,Fall due to failure of rail (event),Fall when railing failed,"This entry states a fall and explicitly attributes it to a railing that failed. The term 'railing' is a common synonym for 'rail' and does not introduce a different entity; it remains the same mechanism. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This maps most precisely to 242400001 Fall due to failure of rail (event). Using a broader fall concept would ignore the specified cause, and specifying a different type of structural failure would be incorrect. No additional attributes such as location, severity, or timing are added."
224464002,Redeployed at work (finding),Internal redeployment at work,"The entry describes redeployment occurring internally within the current workplace, an occupational status finding. Although it uses “internal,” it does not introduce a different attribute beyond the core redeployment concept; it clarifies that the change is within the workplace, which is implicit in redeployment. The best match is Redeployed at work (finding) [224464002], categorized as a Clinical finding. Using a broader employment change or a transfer-to-new-employer concept would be less precise and potentially incorrect."
371543004,Comprehensive history and physical report (record artifact),Comprehensive history and physical report (clinical record),"This variant explicitly identifies the item as a clinical record artifact representing a comprehensive H&P report. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The parent 'History and physical report' would be less specific, and sibling concepts for brief/focused reports would not match the comprehensive descriptor. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
28887008,Injurious sound (physical force),Mechanism documented: injurious sound,"This indicates that the mechanism involves an injurious sound, naming the Physical force explicitly. The contextual phrase “mechanism documented” does not change the coded concept or introduce additional attributes like timing, severity, or outcomes. General “Sound (physical force)” would lack the injurious qualifier; exposure or injury outcome codes would be inappropriate since neither exposure nor the result is specified. The best fit remains SCTID 28887008."
54456008,Ribonuclease F (substance),RNase F,"The main concept is RNase F, which is the standard abbreviation for ribonuclease F. No additional attributes (such as source, function, timing, or severity) are stated. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance concept, and the most precise match is Ribonuclease F (substance), SCTID 54456008. Using the abbreviation does not change the meaning; it is a clinically accepted synonym for the same enzyme substance. A parent concept like Ribonuclease (substance) would be too general, and sibling concepts (e.g., RNase A or RNase H) would be incorrect because the entry explicitly specifies the F isoform."
17377003,"Glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (substance)","Catalog entry: glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase","A catalog context indicates listing but the substance remains glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase, a Substance concept. SCTID 17377003 is the precise code. The catalog label does not alter attributes such as dose, origin, or structural type; thus, it would be incorrect to code to parent Enzyme (substance) or a different glucosidase with other linkage specificities."
768606008,Product containing antibody (product),Antibody agent product,"The phrase refers to a product containing an antibody agent, with no further specification about the antibody type, route, dose, or indication. This is clearly a Product and maps to SCTID 768606008 “Product containing antibody (product)”. Selecting a parent concept like product containing biologic agent would be too general, while a child concept like monoclonal antibody product would be overly specific. Using “agent” in conjunction with “product” remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not alter the coding."
736271009,Outpatient care plan (record artifact),Outpatient care plan,"The entry explicitly names the artifact 'Outpatient care plan' and refers to the document that outlines planned care in the outpatient setting. The main concept is a care plan limited to outpatient context, with no added attributes such as condition, severity, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is the most precise match to SCTID 736271009 because it specifies outpatient care and the artifact nature of a plan. More general parent concepts like 'Care plan (record artifact)' are less specific, and sibling concepts such as 'Inpatient care plan' or 'Discharge plan' do not match the outpatient scope."
465142005,Ostomy bag closure device (physical object),Ostomy pouch clip,"This is a clip designed for closing an ostomy pouch; 'pouch' and 'bag' are interchangeable in this clinical context. No attributes like size, material, or ostomy type are specified. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). The most accurate code is 465142005, since it denotes an ostomy pouch closure device. Parent concepts such as general clips or general ostomy accessories are less exact, and sibling concepts such as the pouch itself are not appropriate because the wording targets a closure device."
299952008,Pseudoathetosis (finding),Pseudoathetosis on neurological examination,"This notes the presence of pseudoathetosis in the context of a neurological examination and maps directly to SNOMED CT 299952008 (Clinical finding). The examination context does not introduce additional attributes. Using a general code like abnormal movement would be overly broad, and using athetosis would be inaccurate. Therefore, pseudoathetosis is the exact match."
305744005,Seen by nurse psychotherapist (finding),Patient states seen by nurse psychotherapist,"A patient-reported statement that they were seen by a nurse psychotherapist still represents the same clinical finding of contact with that provider type. Category: Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 305744005 precisely captures 'Seen by nurse psychotherapist' irrespective of source of documentation. It does not introduce therapy content, consultation, timing, or ongoing care, so other procedure or generalized 'seen by' codes would be less exact."
249103009,Sacrolateral position (finding),Patient-reported: baby described as sacrolateral position,"The patient-reported note conveys that the baby's position is sacrolateral, i.e., the fetal sacrum is laterally oriented. This remains a Clinical finding, best represented by SNOMED CT 249103009. Selecting a parent concept like 'Breech presentation' would lose the lateral specificity, and sibling orientations (anterior/posterior/transverse) are inconsistent. No side or additional qualifiers are included, so child concepts are not applicable. The lay context does not alter the core clinical meaning."
275347009,Absence of fibula (finding),Diagnosis: absence of the fibula,"This entry states a diagnosis finding that the fibula is absent, without adding laterality, cause, or timing. It falls within the Clinical finding category. The most precise SNOMED CT concept is 275347009 (Absence of fibula), since it directly identifies the absent bone. Broader parent categories like 'deficiency of bone' are not specific enough, and child concepts indicating congenital absence or specific laterality would be more detailed than the statement provides. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and supports the same code."
734453002,Terlipressin acetate (substance),Imaging report comment mentions terlipressin acetate,"The imaging comment mentions the substance terlipressin acetate without dosing, route, or product details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 734453002 is appropriate because it captures the acetate salt form. More general or product-based concepts would be less accurate given the wording."
365272009,Finding related to ability to use kettle (finding),Kettle use ability status (not specified),"The entry records a clinical finding about the status of the ability to use a kettle, explicitly noting that the status is not specified. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This maps to 'Finding related to ability to use kettle' (365272009) because it indicates the domain without the specific outcome. Child concepts indicating 'able' or 'unable' are not supported; parent concepts would be too general."
37631008,"Quantitative microbial culture, pour plate method (procedure)",Pour plate procedure for microbial quantification,"This describes using the pour plate procedure to quantify microorganisms, which corresponds to quantitative microbial culture with pour plate and matches SCTID 37631008 in the Procedure category. A parent concept omitting the method would be too broad; siblings specifying other methods would not fit. The wording does not add specimen types, organisms, or result values, maintaining a unique mapping to the target concept."
1363268003,Scheie gonioscopy grading system degree of angle pigmentation grade IV (qualifier value),Degree of angle pigmentation = IV (Scheie),The entry presents a structured notation of the Scheie grading for angle pigmentation as IV. The main concept is the grade IV qualifier within the Scheie gonioscopy grading system. This is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT and aligns with SCTID 1363268003. Generic angle pigmentation findings or other angle grading systems are not appropriate because the specific system (Scheie) and grade (IV) are named. The equals-sign formatting does not introduce new attributes and remains semantically equivalent to the concept.
76731000,Double stranded anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (substance),Assessment note: anti-dsDNA antibody,"Despite the contextual phrase “Assessment note,” the medical concept present is the anti-dsDNA antibody substance. SNOMED CT category: Substance. SCTID 76731000 is the most precise code because the core term designates the antibody targeting dsDNA. The context does not add attributes like positivity, level, isotype, or test method, so parent/child/sibling concepts related to findings or observables are less appropriate than the substance code."
304246002,Entire body cavity subdivision (body structure),Complete body cavity subdivision,"The term 'complete' is a safe synonym for 'entire' in anatomical context and signifies the entire subdivision of a body cavity. Category: Body structure. The entry does not identify which cavity or subdivision, so it cannot be matched to a specific child concept. It is more precise than the parent 'Body cavity subdivision' because it specifies completeness. Therefore, SCTID 304246002 is the most accurate mapping."
224047008,District of Columbia (geographic location),Imaging site: District of Columbia,"The value for the imaging site is District of Columbia, making the geographic location the core concept. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). SCTID 224047008 is exact for this district. Parent concepts (United States) would be nonspecific, and child/sibling concepts like particular facilities or the city alone would not match the stated district. The contextual label (‘Imaging site’) does not alter the place concept."
227259009,Plantain (substance),Patient reports eating plantain,"The concept described is the consumption of the substance plantain; the core item being referred to is plantain itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Plantain (substance) SCTID 227259009 is the correct match since no reaction, allergy, or specific derivative (e.g., pollen, extract) is mentioned. This is not a clinical finding or procedure; it merely situates the substance in a patient-reported context."
258671008,Decimeter (qualifier value),Report units: dm,"The entry specifies that reports use ""dm,"" the standard abbreviation for decimeter, as the unit. This is a Qualifier value representing the unit of measure. SCTID 258671008 is the most precise code because it pinpoints the decimeter unit. Selecting a broader parent such as ""length unit"" or a different sibling unit would be incorrect. The reporting context does not introduce clinical attributes; it simply indicates unit choice, which remains semantically equivalent to decimeter."
1157350000,Grade 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (qualifier value),Patient reports eight out of ten on a 0–10 scale,"This is a patient-reported numeric rating of 8 on a 0–10 scale, which maps directly to 'Grade 8 on a scale of 0 to 10' (SCTID 1157350000). The main concept is the grade value; no additional attributes like domain, severity descriptors, or timing are introduced. Category: Qualifier value. Parent concepts lack the specificity of eight, and sibling grades (e.g., seven or nine) are not applicable. 'Reports' provides contextual source without changing the qualifier value selection."
9880000,Structure of thyroid tubercle (body structure),Chart anatomy section: thyroid tubercle,"This chart entry lists the anatomical thyroid tubercle, identifying the structure itself. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. Structure of thyroid tubercle (SCTID: 9880000) is the most precise code because it matches the named anatomy. Using a parent concept would be overly broad, and sibling concepts such as isthmus or lobes are different structures. The entry remains free of additional attributes, preserving exact mapping."
288676007,Ability to terminate conversation (observable entity),Ability to conclude a conversation,"The verb 'conclude' is a clinically safe synonym for 'terminate' in conversational context, signifying the same observable capability. Category: Observable entity. This matches 288676007 because it centers on the ability variable, not the presence of dysfunction or broader communication domains. No additional attributes are implied."
86165001,Sonar (physical force),Sonar,"The entry names the physical force 'sonar' directly, which denotes acoustic energy used for sound navigation and ranging. This aligns with the SNOMED CT concept Sonar (physical force), which is in the Physical force hierarchy, not a finding or procedure. There are no added attributes such as exposure, injury, severity, timing, or context of use; the entry purely identifies the force itself. This makes 86165001 the most precise match. Broader parent concepts like Sound (physical force) are less specific, and sibling or child concepts such as Ultrasonic wave or diagnostic sonography procedures are not implied. The wording does not introduce any causal or clinical implications; it remains a direct reference to the physical force."
224841005,Fruit shop (environment),Fruit seller's shop,"This wording denotes the premises of a seller of fruit, which equates to a fruit shop as an environmental location. It does not introduce new attributes beyond the environment. The best match in SNOMED CT is Fruit shop (environment) [224841005] under Environment. More general shop concepts are too broad, and sibling environments (e.g., vegetable shop, greengrocer) would not be equivalent. The possessive form does not change the concept; it remains the same environment."
707287001,Hepatitis B vaccination not indicated (situation),Hepatitis B vaccine not necessary.,"Saying the vaccine is 'not necessary' is a clinical paraphrase of 'not indicated' and does not introduce reason, timing, or patient preference. This aligns with Hepatitis B vaccination not indicated (707287001) within the Situation category. Choosing a parent concept like 'vaccination not necessary' would be less specific, and sibling concepts like 'contraindicated' or 'declined' do not match the stated lack of necessity/indication."
437872008,Streptomyces javensis (organism),Species label: Streptomyces javensis,"This phrasing is a labeling context that names the species Streptomyces javensis, without introducing clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism and the best match is SCTID 437872008. Parent taxa or sibling species would not fit because the species is explicit, and child strain concepts are not referenced. 'Species label' is a harmless contextual synonym that preserves the organism-level meaning."
892417201000119109,Mass of right axillary region (finding),Lump in right armpit,"“Lump” is a clinically accepted synonym for an unspecified mass, and “armpit” is lay terminology for the axillary region; the entry explicitly specifies the right side. This is a Clinical finding best represented by Mass of right axillary region (finding), SCTID 892417201000119109. More general parents (axillary mass without laterality) are less precise, and node-specific or neoplastic siblings are not implied because the wording does not indicate lymph node involvement or malignancy. The synonym use does not introduce additional attributes."
108940007,Product containing immunomodulator (product),Preprocedure med list item: immunomodulator product,"The phrase references a preprocedure medication list item that is an immunomodulator-containing product; the timing context does not introduce attributes that change the product classification. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 108940007 is the correct, specific code. A more general product code would omit the immunomodulator detail, and a more specific child naming an agent would go beyond the stated information. The wording remains at the product class level."
223630002,Vanuatu (geographic location),Vanuatu listed as location,"This entry conveys Vanuatu as the location value without adding patient-specific or event-related attributes. It points to the specific country, best coded as Vanuatu (geographic location), SCTID 223630002, in the Location hierarchy. The parent “Geographic location” is non-specific, and neither child places within Vanuatu nor other countries are indicated, confirming precise selection."
223969005,Clwyd (geographic location),Family from Clwyd.,"The core entity is the geographic location Clwyd; familial origin is contextual. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The correct code is Clwyd (geographic location) SCTID 223969005 since it uniquely identifies the place. Parents like Geographic location lack specificity, and siblings such as adjacent counties or the country level are not stated. The phrase does not introduce attributes that change the location concept."
763875007,Product containing sulfonamide (product),Medication reconciliation: sulfonamide product,"The reconciliation note refers to a product and specifies sulfonamide as the ingredient class, without details of dose, form, or specific agent. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical / biologic product. SCTID 763875007 best represents this class-level product containing sulfonamide. Using a more generic parent would lose specificity, and choosing child/sibling concepts for named sulfonamides or role-based subclasses would be inappropriate given the generic phrasing."
1853441000004104,Gleason scoring system for prostatic cancer by highest grade nodule (staging scale),Gleason scale variant used: highest-grade nodule (prostate),"The text points to the variant of the Gleason scale used—highest-grade nodule—in prostate cancer. It is a statement about scale variant, not a clinical result, thereby fitting the Staging scale (Qualifier value) category. The inclusion of the highest-grade nodule qualifier ensures precise alignment with SCTID 1853441000004104 and excludes the generic parent concept and alternate or sibling scales such as ISUP Grade Group or predominant pattern scoring."
285646004,Electric discharge (physical force),Electric discharge event,"Characterizing the occurrence as an event still denotes the physical phenomenon of electric discharge without clinical or subtype detail. Category: Physical force. Electric discharge (SCTID 285646004) fits best. Parent Physical force lacks specificity; child concepts (electrostatic discharge, arc flash) would add a mechanism not stated. Sibling clinical findings like Electric shock are inappropriate because no injury or exposure outcome is mentioned."
705688000,Gauze dressing (physical object),Wound dressing (gauze),"The bracketed specification indicates the wound dressing is made of gauze, pointing to the object Gauze dressing. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This is more specific than the parent concept of generic wound dressing and does not shift to child concepts like sterile gauze dressing or impregnated gauze, as no such attributes are stated. It also avoids siblings like gauze bandage or gauze swab, maintaining alignment with SCTID 705688000."
4211000179102,Bone density scan report (record artifact),Bone density imaging report,"This entry denotes a report document for imaging focused on bone density, making it a record artifact rather than a procedural or finding concept. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It fits “Bone density scan report (record artifact)” SCTID 4211000179102 most precisely because the subject of the report is bone density imaging. A generic imaging report would be too broad, and any procedure or finding concepts would be incorrect because the entry centers on the report itself. No additional attributes (e.g., results, time) are present."
22439003,Forcible intercourse (event),ED documentation: forcible intercourse,"The term denotes forcible intercourse documented in the emergency department, with no extra attributes such as time, site, or injury severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It matches Forcible intercourse (event) because it explicitly references forced sexual intercourse. Parent concepts like Sexual assault (event) encompass broader acts; children with anatomical site specification are not stated here. The ED documentation context is administrative and does not influence the code selection."
223687006,Mexico (geographic location),Mexico entered on registration,"This reflects a data-entry context where Mexico is recorded, signifying the country. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The precise match is 223687006 | Mexico (geographic location), representing the named sovereign nation. More general parent concepts (e.g., Country) lack specificity; the text does not indicate child places within Mexico or sibling countries. The registration context does not add attributes to the place; it simply confirms the country name, making the Mexico geographic location concept the correct code."
309989009,Orthopedic department (environment),Orthopedic department (environment),"The entry explicitly restates the concept as an environment, reinforcing the place-of-care notion. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It is an exact representation of 309989009 and does not add attributes such as inpatient/outpatient status or functional unit type. Parents like generic departments lack specialty specificity, and siblings/children (e.g., clinic, ward) introduce a different care context. The parenthetical clarification does not change semantics, ensuring the identical code is selected."
236884004,Excision of uterine polyp (procedure),Operative procedure: uterine polyp excision,"This entry is formatted as an operative report line naming the procedure, uterine polyp excision, which is synonymous with Excision of uterine polyp. It is a Procedure. The context label “Operative procedure:” does not alter the clinical concept or add timing; it simply indicates documentation style. No technique or subsite is specified, so SCTID 236884004 is most precise. Parent or child concepts implying different specificity or methods are less appropriate."
773514007,Speech and language therapy care plan (record artifact),Speech-language pathology plan of care,"This states a plan of care (POC) tied to the speech-language pathology discipline, which is a documented care plan artifact. The SNOMED category is Record artifact. SCTID 773514007 precisely captures a care plan for speech and language therapy. Broader care plan artifacts lack discipline specificity, and other disciplines’ care plans are inappropriate. 'Plan of care' is a clinically accepted synonym for care plan and does not introduce any additional attributes."
223539005,South east African country (geographic location),Return from a southeast African country,"This travel-return statement still centers on the location—a country in Southeast Africa. Category: Geographic location (geographic location). The action (return) is contextual and does not modify the location entity. Parent concepts would be too broad; child concepts naming specific countries would be too narrow; and siblings with different regional directions do not correspond to “southeast.” Hence, 223539005 is the precise code for the location referenced."
242240005,Explosion on board spacecraft in flight (event),Onboard explosion noted on spacecraft during flight phase,"The entry notes an onboard explosion on a spacecraft during the flight phase, which is synonymous with 'in flight.' It represents an Event and maps to SCTID 242240005. The wording avoids extra qualifiers such as cause or outcome, focusing on the precise scenario. Broader explosion codes or non-spacecraft events would not match as well, justifying this code."
258241007,Third edition (qualifier value),Edition 3,"“Edition 3” uses a numeric representation to indicate the third edition; the context is clearly edition rather than version or revision. No extra attributes are added. It corresponds to Third edition (qualifier value) [258241007], in the Qualifier value hierarchy. A generic edition parent is too broad, and siblings (e.g., “Edition 2”) or separate qualifiers (version/printing/revision) would misrepresent this entry."
223612009,Lebanon (geographic location),Residence in Lebanon,"This indicates that the location involved is Lebanon, in the context of residence. The coded entity is the country Lebanon as a Geographic location. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Lebanon (geographic location), SCTID: 223612009. Broader or different locations are not implied, and no child entities (e.g., cities within Lebanon) are named. The residence context is an attribute but does not change the underlying location concept being coded."
61560006,Enophrys taurina (organism),Observation labeled Enophrys taurina,"This entry labels an observation with the species name Enophrys taurina, which denotes the organism at species level and maps to SNOMED CT Organism SCTID 61560006. The observation label is context only and does not introduce attributes or different taxa. Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise than the explicit binomial, and no child concept is implied, so the species-level code is the correct mapping."
185255006,Seen in endocrine clinic (finding),Triage summary: seen in endocrine clinic,"This triage summary entry states the patient was seen in an endocrine clinic, matching the clinic setting finding. Category: Clinical finding. No additional attributes (timing, reason, severity) are added. SNOMED CT 185255006 precisely encodes 'Seen in endocrine clinic.' A parent like 'Seen in clinic' lacks specialty detail, and sibling concepts for other specialty clinics or provider-focused findings diverge from the clinic setting."
1193540006,Island in region of United States Virgin Islands (geographic location),Encounter location recorded: USVI island,"This puts the encounter’s location as a USVI island, clearly indicating an island within the United States Virgin Islands. The main concept is geographic location (island in USVI). SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 1193540006 is precise here, distinguishing the island subtype from the territory parent and avoiding overly specific named-island children. The term 'USVI' is an accepted abbreviation and does not alter the semantics of the location."
422152000,Wash - dosing instruction imperative (qualifier value),eRx instruction verb: Wash,"This electronic prescription entry records the imperative verb “Wash,” with no other details. The main concept is a dosing instruction imperative. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The appropriate code is 422152000. The parent concept is overly general, and sibling verbs (e.g., “Take,” “Rinse,” “Apply”) would be inaccurate. The eRx context does not alter semantics, so 422152000 is the correct, specific mapping."
34460004,Percina notogramma (organism),Catalog entry: Percina notogramma,"The text presents a catalog entry labeled with the exact species name Percina notogramma, signaling the organism concept. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 34460004 is the precise match since the species-level taxon is specified; mapping to Percina (genus) or a general fish concept would be less accurate, and sibling species would be incorrect. The catalog context does not add clinical attributes; it merely references the organism."
226582000,Wholemeal pita bread (substance),Pantry item: wholemeal pita bread,"The entry names the substance as 'wholemeal pita bread' within a pantry listing context, which does not alter the concept and maps to SNOMED CT Substance 226582000. Category: Substance. There are no added qualifiers such as flavorings or preparation. Coding to broader 'bread' or to other pita types would reduce precision. The wording remains uniquely codable to the specific wholemeal pita bread substance."
234717005,Application of subgingival dressing (procedure),Subgingival dressing procedure completed,"This entry indicates completion of a procedure whose focus is subgingival dressing application. It conveys only the presence of that intervention, without additional attributes. Category: Procedure. The most precise match is SCTID 234717005. General periodontal dressing procedures are broader and may include supragingival placement, whereas irrigation or medicament application are different procedures. The wording is a paraphrase confirming the same procedural concept."
364329005,Characteristic of first stage of labor (observable entity),Characteristic of first stage of labor,"The entry explicitly names the observable entity describing characteristics of the first stage of labor. The main concept is an attribute/descriptor pertaining to stage one of labor, without introducing any specific values, abnormality, duration, or subphases. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. This maps most precisely to SCTID 364329005 because it targets the general notion of a characteristic of the first stage, rather than the stage itself or a particular measured parameter. Broader parents like 'Characteristic of labor' are too general, and siblings such as 'Characteristic of second stage of labor' or 'Characteristic of third stage of labor' are incorrect given the explicit reference to the first stage. No additional attributes are added, so the wording aligns exactly with the coded concept."
223374005,Fuerteventura (geographic location),Geographic location: Fuerteventura,"The entry labels the data element as a geographic location and specifies Fuerteventura, keeping the concept purely locational. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The contextual label does not create a different coded meaning; it simply clarifies the field. No parent (e.g., Canary Islands) or sibling/child place is referenced. SCTID 223374005 is the exact match."
79491001,Hospital-based radiology facility (environment),Radiology department within the hospital,"This entry clearly points to the radiology department that exists within the hospital, expressing only the environmental aspect. SNOMED CT category: Environment or location. SCTID 79491001 best fits because it specifically represents a hospital-based radiology facility. Broader parents like “Hospital” lack the radiology focus, and siblings such as outpatient imaging centers not tied to a hospital are excluded by the wording. “Department” here is a standard synonym for the facility space."
368455003,Entire right hand (body structure),"Right hand, entire structure","This wording identifies laterality (right) and specifies “entire structure,” ensuring the whole hand is referenced. It is a Body structure concept. The best match is 368455003, as it denotes the entire right hand. Using “structure of right hand” would be less specific, potentially pointing to any part, and parent/sibling concepts would misrepresent laterality or completeness."
22951005,Screening smoke (substance),Smoke used for screening (substance),"This paraphrase clarifies the intended type of smoke—used for screening—while maintaining focus on the substance. The parenthetical “(substance)” reinforces category. SNOMED CT category: Substance. SCTID 22951005 is exact; generic smoke is inadequate, and tobacco smoke or other source-defined smokes are inappropriate. No procedure or exposure is asserted; it’s a naming description."
309102001,Cartilage biopsy specimen (specimen),Biopsy sample of cartilage,"This entry describes a sample (i.e., specimen) taken via biopsy and consisting of cartilage. Explicit attributes are tissue type and method. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 309102001 is the precise code. A parent like “Cartilage specimen” without the biopsy qualifier would be broader and could include non-biopsy sources; a sibling for other tissue types would be incorrect. “Sample” is clinically synonymous with specimen here and does not imply processing or other attributes."
784569008,Skin structure of canthus of right eye (body structure),Right canthal skin,"This phrase uses the adjective 'canthal' to indicate the canthus and specifies the right side, while focusing on the skin only. The concepts are skin, canthus, and laterality (right). It belongs to the SNOMED CT Body structure hierarchy, and Skin structure of canthus of right eye (784569008) is the exact anatomical target. A parent without laterality would be too broad, and a sibling such as left canthal skin would not match the stated laterality. 'Canthal' is a clinically standard synonym for canthus and does not change code selection."
102458000,Shaken baby syndrome (finding),SBS (shaken baby syndrome),"The entry uses the abbreviation 'SBS' and immediately expands it to 'shaken baby syndrome,' retaining unambiguous identification of the Clinical finding mapped to SNOMED CT 102458000. The expansion prevents acronym ambiguity and ensures precise concept selection. No additional attributes (timing, severity, associated conditions) are introduced. It is more specific than parent abusive injury concepts and avoids siblings such as suspected shaken baby syndrome. Therefore, the expanded term corresponds exactly to the intended code."
1156080007,Surgical margin involved by primary malignant neoplasm of pancreas in resection of body of pancreas (observable entity),Oncologic note: positive margin by primary pancreatic cancer after resection of the pancreatic body.,"This oncologic documentation records a positive margin due to primary pancreatic cancer in the context of pancreatic body resection. As an Observable entity, it is a margin status observation. SCTID 1156080007 is the best fit since it includes margin involvement, primary pancreatic malignancy, and localization to the body segment. A parent concept for general positive margins lacks the segment specificity; sibling concepts for other segments (head/tail) would not match. The synonym “positive margin” is directly equivalent to “surgical margin involved.”"
309201001,Ascitic fluid specimen (specimen),"Ascitic fluid sample, specimen type","This labels the specimen type explicitly as an ascitic fluid sample, which is synonymous with ascitic fluid specimen. No additional clinical details are provided. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The exact match is Ascitic fluid specimen (309201001). Broader or different fluid types are excluded by the wording, and there is no specification of particular testing that would necessitate a child concept."
224329005,Legal affairs and legal constraints (observable entity),Law-related affairs and legal constraints,"“Law-related affairs” is a transparent synonym for legal affairs, coupled with explicit legal constraints, designating the same observable domain. This fits the Observable entity category and maps to SNOMED CT 224329005 as a general data element for legal matters. Parent observables are too generic, while children such as imprisonment status or court orders are not indicated. The paraphrase preserves the concept scope and does not add any attribute like presence, timing, or causation."
224677001,Battered wives hostel (environment),Women's refuge shelter,"This phrase describes a shelter-refuge specifically for women, consistent with a battered wives hostel. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The code SCTID 224677001 aligns because it identifies the women’s refuge established for battered wives. Parent terms such as Shelter (environment) or Women's shelter (environment) without reference to battered women would be broader. Sibling concepts like Family shelter or Safe house (general) risk overgeneralization. The entry does not introduce causation or timing; it simply names the environment, supporting the exact environment concept."
171230000,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening (procedure),COPD screening documented,"This entry indicates that the procedure of screening for COPD has been documented, not introducing results, modality, timing, or setting. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening (procedure), SCTID 171230000, under Procedure. Parent concepts like generic screening are too broad; children/siblings with specific modalities or different foci (e.g., asthma screening) would be inaccurate. 'Documented' does not change the clinical concept; it simply reflects record status of the same procedure."
287640009,Excision of skin lesion and Z-plasty (procedure),Excision of skin lesion using Z-plasty repair technique.,"This entry highlights that the skin lesion excision was accompanied by repair via Z-plasty technique, capturing the two-step procedure. It is a Procedure and maps accurately to SCTID 287640009. Parent codes lacking the specified repair method or sibling codes for Z-plasty without the excision would be less precise. The phrasing uses “repair technique” to denote Z-plasty without adding attributes such as site or pathology."
82898005,Residential in ground swimming pool (environment),Home environment: in-ground swimming pool present,"This documentation line explicitly records the presence of an in-ground swimming pool in the home environment, i.e., residential. Attributes included are the in-ground construction and residential context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The most precise match is SCTID 82898005. Parent concepts are too broad (e.g., In-ground swimming pool without residential), and siblings like public in-ground pools or residential above-ground pools do not match the stated environment and construction."
370885003,Activities of daily living management (procedure),ADL management intervention,"The concept centers on an intervention whose intent is management of ADLs. Category: Procedure. Use of 'intervention' is a clinically acceptable synonym indicating a delivered management action, not an assessment or educational service. Sibling procedures such as ADL assistance or training are different in intent. Therefore, SCTID 370885003 is the most accurate code."
215841000,Hit by boat while water skiing (event),Trauma mechanism: struck by boat while water-skiing,"The trauma mechanism is described as being struck by a boat with concurrent water-skiing activity, which maps precisely to the Event concept 'Hit by boat while water skiing' (SCTID 215841000). No severity, timing, or injury details are present. Parent concepts lack specificity, and sibling concepts with different watercraft or activities would not match. 'Struck by' is clinically equivalent to 'hit by,' ensuring the same code applies."
722447009,Confirmation of insurance coverage for treatment (record artifact),Patient states insurance confirmed coverage for treatment.,"The statement reflects a documented report that coverage for treatment was confirmed, still representing a record of confirmation without extra attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and matches SCTID 722447009. Although the source is the patient, the concept remains confirmation of coverage, not merely eligibility or authorization, so parent or sibling concepts would be less accurate."
736397000,Lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy care plan (record artifact),Lower GI endoscopy care plan documented,"This statement identifies that a lower GI endoscopy care plan is documented, maintaining focus on the plan artifact. The main concept is a care plan for lower GI endoscopy, which is in the Record artifact category. SCTID 736397000 is appropriate because it denotes exactly this care plan documentation. A broader care plan code would lose specificity, and any procedure code would misrepresent the entry. There is no indication of a narrower subtype such as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy care plans, so child concepts are not a better fit."
214150008,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision between motor vehicle and animal carrying a person, driver of motor vehicle injured (event)",Driver of a motor vehicle injured during traffic collision with ridden animal.,"This statement frames an Event where a motor vehicle traffic collision occurred with a ridden animal and the injured party was the driver. SCTID 214150008 is the correct, most precise match because it captures the traffic accident, collision counterpart, and the driver-injury attribute. Parent concepts lacking the injured role or siblings indicating passenger/unspecified occupant injury would be less appropriate. The phrase “ridden animal” is a direct synonym for “animal carrying a person,” preserving equivalence without adding qualifiers."
705808000,Drilling system (physical object),Inventory record: drilling system,"An inventory listing that names 'drilling system' identifies the Physical object exactly, fitting SNOMED 705808000 without introducing specific device subtype attributes. It is distinct from a single drill instrument and avoids narrowing to specialized variants, making parent and child/sibling concepts less appropriate."
764133002,Product containing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiator (product),Prescription includes a CFTR potentiator product,"This entry indicates that the prescribed item is a product containing a CFTR potentiator, which corresponds to SNOMED CT concept 764133002 in the product hierarchy. It does not specify ingredient names, formulations, or combination components, avoiding mapping to child concepts like specific branded modular combinations. It is more specific than parent modulator categories due to the explicit “potentiator” description, and no dosing or indication attributes are added."
836392007,Arrhythmia-detection blood pressure ambulatory recorder (physical object),Arrhythmia-detecting ambulatory blood pressure recording device,"The device is explicitly described as an ambulatory blood pressure recorder that detects arrhythmias, covering the device’s dual scope. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This maps directly to SCTID 836392007 because it is a recorder (not a procedure) with both BP and arrhythmia detection capabilities. Parent or sibling concepts that lack either ambulatory BP recording or arrhythmia detection would be less appropriate. The adjectival phrasing 'arrhythmia-detecting' is clinically equivalent and does not introduce any additional attributes."
778057007,Structure of right flexor hallucis longus tendon (body structure),Right flexor hallucis longus tendon documented,"The documentation context does not alter the core anatomical meaning: the right flexor hallucis longus tendon. Category: Body structure. This maps exactly to Structure of right flexor hallucis longus tendon. It excludes other attributes or structures (e.g., sheath, insertion), so a parent concept would be too general and siblings (e.g., left side) or children are not supported by the wording."
414762001,Monoclonal alpha heavy chain detected (finding),Monoclonal IgA heavy chain detected,"“IgA heavy chain” is the clinically standard synonym for “alpha heavy chain,” making this a semantically equivalent statement of detection. It remains a Clinical finding and aligns with 414762001. The wording does not indicate intact IgA (paraprotein) or a disease state, thereby avoiding concepts like “Monoclonal IgA paraprotein detected” or “Alpha heavy chain disease.” It is more precise than parents that don’t specify the heavy chain class and inappropriate for siblings involving non-alpha heavy chains."
718254009,Corneal marker handpiece tip (physical object),Label text: corneal marker handpiece tip,"This portrays the exact term as it might appear on a label, referring to the specific component, the corneal marker handpiece tip (Physical object). The best SNOMED CT match is 718254009. The label context does not change the clinical meaning or introduce attributes; it distinguishes it from the entire marker and other tips."
110945007,Vulva cytologic material (specimen),Specimen type: vulva cytologic material,"This clearly identifies the specimen type as cytologic material and the source as vulva, with no added attributes beyond what the concept encodes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 110945007 exactly fits the description of vulva cytologic material (specimen). A generic cytologic specimen parent would be insufficiently specific, and siblings like vulvar swab or tissue biopsy denote different materials. The phrasing uses common requisition terminology but remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
397463005,Maximum thickness of diffuse tumor (observable entity),Thickest dimension of diffuse tumor,"“Thickest dimension” is a paraphrase for maximum thickness, focusing on the same dimensional attribute for a diffuse tumor. The entry avoids method, values, site, or timing. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. This matches SCTID 397463005 by specifying the maximum thickness dimension of the diffuse tumor. A parent concept like generic thickness does not capture the extremum, and siblings measuring diameter or length would be incorrect. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to maximum thickness."
223361004,Bonaire (geographic location),Travel destination: Bonaire,"The value provided is the geographic location 'Bonaire' used in a travel context. The entry does not add time, severity, or condition details—only the place. This maps to the SNOMED CT category Geographic location (Location). Coding a parent region (Caribbean Netherlands) or child localities within Bonaire would be less appropriate. SCTID 223361004 is the precise match for Bonaire."
216359002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, beach resort (environment)",ED triage note: accident location is beach resort,"This triage documentation sets the accident’s place-of-occurrence to a beach resort, mapping to SNOMED CT 216359002. Main concept: external cause location for accident. Attribute: beach resort venue. Category: Environment. Parent concepts without venue specificity would be less exact, and sibling places like general beach or pool are not appropriate. The wording remains strictly about location without adding mechanism, severity, or time."
770374002,Product containing vasopressin receptor antagonist (product),Medication category: vasopressin receptor antagonist,"This entry classifies a medication under the vasopressin receptor antagonist category, pointing to a product containing that class of active. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It maintains class-level specificity without introducing ingredient names, strengths, routes, or indications. Parents are too general; children naming specific agents are overly specific. The categorization context does not alter the pharmacologic concept, so the given product concept is most accurate."
441792002,Specimen from adrenal gland obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Suprarenal gland fine needle aspiration biopsy specimen,"This entry uses the synonym ‘suprarenal gland’ for adrenal gland and specifies fine needle aspiration biopsy, clearly identifying a Specimen. It matches SNOMED CT 441792002, which is the specimen from the adrenal gland obtained by FNA biopsy. Parents lacking the acquisition method and siblings with other techniques are less specific. The “suprarenal” terminology is clinically equivalent to “adrenal gland” and does not alter the coding semantics."
1255882006,Structure of anterior crural muscle of left lower leg (body structure),"Structure of anterior crural muscle, left lower leg","This entry mirrors the preferred term and retains all key attributes: muscle structure, anterior crural location, and left lower leg laterality. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It precisely aligns with SCTID 1255882006. It avoids naming any specific anterior compartment muscle (which would be a child concept) and does not generalize to the compartment without muscle (which would be a sibling/related structure). The wording does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
411884007,Cotton crude fibers specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Cotton fibers (crude) diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry delineates a diagnostic allergen product derived from cotton fibers in crude form. SNOMED CT category: Product. It most precisely matches 411884007 by stating both diagnostic purpose and the cotton crude fiber source. Parent concepts would be too general, and sibling/child concepts targeting different allergen sources or therapeutic intent would be incorrect. The wording avoids procedural or dosing attributes."
160250007,No family history of malignancy (situation),Oncology H&P: family history—no malignancy.,"Within the oncology history and physical, the family history section states no malignancy, i.e., no malignant neoplasms reported among relatives. The main concept is the absence of familial malignancy; attributes include family-history context and negation, without added specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Situation, and SCTID 160250007 'No family history of malignancy' is the precise code. Broader parents would overgeneralize, and siblings that indicate a positive family history or specify particular cancers or relative degrees would not align with the general negative statement. 'Malignancy' remains clinically equivalent to malignant neoplasm."
247293003,Response to low frequency sounds (observable entity),Patient-reported response to low-pitched sounds,"This phrasing reflects a patient-reported context while describing the same observable: response to low-pitched (i.e., low-frequency) sounds. Category: Observable entity. SNOMED CT 247293003 is the correct code because “low-pitched” is a clinically equivalent synonym for low-frequency and the entry does not introduce abnormality, severity, laterality, or thresholds. A parent concept would be too general, and siblings specifying other frequency bands would be mismatched. The patient-report context changes only the documentation source, not the observable being coded."
712877007,Temporary clinic (environment),Impermanent clinic,"Main concept: an impermanent clinic denotes a clinic that exists on a temporary basis; this focuses entirely on environment. No additional characteristics are stated. SNOMED CT category: Environment. 'Impermanent clinic' is a clinically acceptable synonym of Temporary clinic (environment). Parent clinic settings lack explicit impermanence, and sibling settings such as field hospitals or permanent clinics differ in nature."
160855009,Partner retired (situation),Partner: retired.,"This problem-list style entry assigns the retired status to the partner, representing a social Situation. SNOMED CT 'Partner retired (situation)' [160855009] matches exactly because it combines the specified relationship with the retirement state. Broader or different-relationship codes (patient, spouse, family member) would be less precise or incorrect. The phrasing is minimal yet semantically equivalent, with no added attributes."
122609004,Specimen from lung obtained by bronchial washing procedure (specimen),Source: Lung; collection method: bronchial washing,"This is a lab/report style entry that specifies the anatomical source (lung) and the collection method (bronchial washing). The entity is a specimen, making the SNOMED CT category Specimen. The explicit pairing of site and method supports SCTID 122609004 as the most precise match. More general parent classes (e.g., 'Specimen from lung') lack the method attribute; different method siblings (e.g., 'Tracheal aspirate from lung') would be incorrect. The phrasing does not introduce any additional attributes and uses clinically conventional terminology."
117877009,Somatic cell assay (procedure),Assessment note: somatic cell assay,"The entry places the term in an assessment note, but the substantive concept is a somatic cell assay. Category: Procedure. There are no additional attributes (no plan status, results, or technique). The most accurate SNOMED code is 117877009 Somatic cell assay. Selecting a more general laboratory assessment code would be imprecise, and choosing a specific subtype (e.g., mutation assay) would add information not present. The context label does not change coding."
1306645004,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Documentation photo: extraoral 45° left facial half; lips at rest; jaws in centric relation.,"This identifies a documented extraoral photograph of the left half of the face at a 45-degree view, with lips at rest and jaws in centric relation. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 1306645004 precisely matches the specified attributes. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling/child variants that change side, angle, or posture would be inappropriate. “Lips at rest” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “lips relaxed,” preserving codability."
294358002,Allergy to tioconazole (finding),Do not prescribe tioconazole — allergy,"This directive implies a known allergy to tioconazole that precludes prescribing, without introducing reaction type, severity, or timing. It is a Clinical finding and matches SNOMED Allergy to tioconazole (finding) [294358002]. Coding to broader categories like Allergy to antifungal agent would be less precise, and choosing sibling allergies to other substances would be wrong. The instruction-style phrasing is semantically equivalent to documenting tioconazole allergy."
770741004,Musculoskeletal infrared phototherapy unit skin-adhesive patch (physical object),Stick-on infrared phototherapy patch for musculoskeletal use,"The entry denotes a stick-on (skin-adhesive) patch that delivers infrared phototherapy for musculoskeletal applications. The main concept is a Physical object (Device) with attributes: infrared phototherapy modality, patch form, skin adherence, and musculoskeletal purpose. This matches SCTID 770741004, which specifically specifies musculoskeletal infrared phototherapy and skin-adhesive patch. A parent like a general infrared phototherapy patch or a sibling such as non-adhesive or non-musculoskeletal devices would not capture the musculoskeletal and adhesive details. 'Stick-on' is a common synonym for skin-adhesive and does not change the intended code."
900000000000441003,SNOMED CT Model Component (metadata),SNOMED CT model component (metadata) entry,"Using ‘entry’ reflects the concept as a terminology entry and does not alter its semantic scope or add attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Metadata. This aligns with SCTID 900000000000441003. Parent-level metadata concepts are too broad, while child-level specifics (attributes, relationship types) are not stated. Sibling metadata types (reference sets, modules) do not match the content of the phrase."
215244001,"Animal-drawn vehicle accident involving overturning of animal-drawn vehicle, occupant of animal-drawn vehicle injured (event)",Injury as an occupant due to overturning of animal-drawn vehicle,"States that injury occurred as an occupant because an animal-drawn vehicle overturned. Concepts: animal-drawn vehicle, overturning, injured occupant. SNOMED CT category: Event. This matches SCTID 215244001 precisely. Parent concepts lacking explicit mechanism or role would be less precise; specifying driver/passenger would be overly detailed. The phrasing uses standard, equivalent terms without adding extraneous attributes."
284589001,Park (environment),Park area,"This wording refers to the area of a park, maintaining a generic environmental reference without subtyping. The SNOMED CT category is Environment; the concept Park (environment) [284589001] is the precise selection. It does not indicate a different environment like garden, nor a specialized park subtype such as national park. The word 'area' is descriptive but does not change the underlying concept from a park."
256381006,Red cells - supplemented - irradiated (product),"Product name: Red cells, supplemented and irradiated","The entry clearly identifies the product as red cells with supplementation and irradiation. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This is the precise match to SCTID 256381006, as it includes both attributes and no extras. Parent concepts like unmodified red cells or siblings capturing only one modification are less accurate. The wording stays within the product domain without introducing delivery or clinical use."
218017003,Accident caused by powered lawn mower (event),Cause of accident: powered lawn mower,"This entry specifies the external cause of an accident as a powered lawn mower, maintaining focus on the accidental event and its causal agent. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 218017003 accurately captures an accident caused by a powered lawn mower. A parent such as “cause of accident: lawn mower” would not include the powered qualification; siblings like nonpowered mower causes would be incorrect. No other attributes are introduced."
85037008,Doxepin hydrochloride (substance),Active ingredient: doxepin hydrochloride,"This context labels the chemical as an active ingredient but does not introduce product form, dose, or indication. The main concept remains the substance “doxepin hydrochloride,” best coded as SCTID 85037008 (Substance). Broader or sibling concepts (doxepin base, other salts, or medicinal products) do not fit as the wording targets the ingredient identity specifically as the hydrochloride salt."
1279957000,American Joint Committee on Cancer rpM1a(1) (qualifier value),AJCC rpM1a(1) value,"This states the AJCC staging value explicitly as rpM1a(1). The concept represented is the AJCC recurrent pathologic M1a(1) qualifier value, which aligns with SNOMED CT’s Qualifier value category. The inclusion of rp and “(1)” ensures exact correspondence to SCTID 1279957000. Variants such as rpM1a without the numeric suffix or other M1 subclasses would be less accurate. The wording remains semantically equivalent without adding attributes."
239623006,Removal of component of external fixator frame (procedure),External fixator frame piece removal,"This entry states a procedure removing a piece (synonym for component) of the external fixator frame. It does not add attributes such as body site or timing. Category: Procedure. SCTID 239623006 precisely captures removal of an external fixator frame component. Codes for removing the entire device, removing pins, or adjusting the device are inappropriate because the phrasing explicitly concerns a frame component."
55894005,Lagoa crispata (organism),Target species: Lagoa crispata,"The entry indicates that the target species is Lagoa crispata, with no additional qualifiers. The main concept is the organism at species level, within the SNOMED CT Organism category. SCTID 55894005 is the most accurate code. The term 'target' does not alter the taxonomic identity or imply a broader or different organism; there is no indication of life stage or related species, so the exact species concept remains the best fit."
219239003,Assault by hot liquid (event),Assault with hot liquid,"The entry describes an assault where a hot liquid was used, and does not add additional attributes. This is an Event concept and matches SNOMED CT 219239003 Assault by hot liquid (event). A parent like Assault (event) lacks the hot liquid mechanism, while siblings such as accidental hot liquid exposure or different assault mechanisms are not indicated. The preposition 'with' is clinically equivalent to 'by' here."
764892007,Product containing fusion protein (product),Fusion protein product documented in chart,"This entry indicates that the chart documents a product containing a fusion protein, mapping to Product containing fusion protein (product) within the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category. The phrasing underscores a product-level entity, thereby avoiding the substance concept Fusion protein (substance). It introduces no brand, dose, form, strength, route, or indication specifics, so child-level clinical drug concepts are not appropriate. Parent concepts such as Biologic product are too general and lack the fusion protein specificity, while siblings referring to other actives (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) do not match. The contextual detail (“documented in chart”) does not change the core concept; “fusion protein product” remains a clinically equivalent synonym for medicinal product containing a fusion protein and does not alter code selection."
285097008,Mudflats (environment),Mudflat site,"The term identifies the site as a mudflat, which directly points to the mudflats environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The wording introduces no extra attributes (cause, timing, laterality), so 285097008 is the exact match. Parent environments and sibling landforms (beach, marsh, sand flats) are excluded by the specificity of ‘mudflat.’ ‘Site’ is a neutral descriptor and does not change the concept’s scope."
718870002,OPHI-II (Occupational Performance History Interview II) Version 2.1 occupational settings (environment) scale,OPHI-II v2.1 occupational environment settings scale,"This synonymic order (occupational environment settings) still unambiguously refers to the OPHI-II Version 2.1 occupational settings (environment) scale. The entity is an assessment scale artifact, categorized as Record artifact (Assessment scale). No administration, results, or other attributes are included, making SCTID 718870002 the exact match. It does not invoke the full instrument or other scales, and avoids any child score concepts. The word order variation is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not change code selection."
44818006,Triakis semifasciata (organism),Observation record: Triakis semifasciata,"The record documents an observation of Triakis semifasciata, indicating the organism. This falls under the Organism category and pinpoints the species-level identification, which is more specific than parent shark groupings or other Triakis species. No clinical modifiers are included. The species code 44818006 is the most accurate mapping."
13264005,Klossiella cobayae (organism),"Klossiella cobayae, organism classification reference","This phrasing references classification but centers on the organism name Klossiella cobayae. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, with the exact match Klossiella cobayae (SCTID 13264005). It does not imply infection, host, or detection; it is a taxonomic referent. Parent concepts (genus or higher) would be too general, and other species would not correspond to the named entity."
59855004,Entire posterior renal segment (body structure),Complete posterior renal segment,"By stating 'complete posterior renal segment,' the entry denotes the full posterior segment of the kidney. The main concept is the anatomical segment (Body structure) and matches SCTID 59855004. A parent like 'kidney structure' lacks segmental specificity, and siblings like 'posterior renal cortex' or 'posterior surface' would introduce different anatomical constructs. 'Complete' is equivalent to 'entire' and preserves the intended structure without adding attributes."
773983001,"Ear, nose and throat care plan (record artifact)",ENT care plan discussed today,"This entry references an ENT care plan and notes discussion; the main concept is the ENT care plan record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. 'Discussed' introduces encounter context but does not alter the artifact type, so Ear, nose and throat care plan (record artifact) [773983001] is the most accurate code. More general care plan codes miss the specialty detail, and narrower ENT plan subtypes are not implied."
57134006,"Instrument, device (physical object)",Instrument and device (unspecified),"The entry covers both instrument and device in a single, unspecified, generic sense without any detail about form, purpose, or clinical role. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 57134006 is the precise match since it captures instruments/devices in general. More specific device classes (diagnostic, therapeutic, implantable) would imply attributes not present. Mapping to “Physical object” would be overly general. The term “unspecified” maintains neutrality and does not shift coding."
224674008,Motel (environment),Patient staying at a motel,"The phrase provides a patient context but identifies only the environmental location type: a motel. It does not introduce events, causes, or sublocations (e.g., room, parking lot). In SNOMED CT, the appropriate hierarchy is Environment or geographical location, and the specific code is Motel (environment) [224674008]. Broader parents like Accommodation are less precise, and siblings (Hotel, Hostel) are not indicated. The verb ‘staying’ does not alter the environmental concept."
258018007,Drainage bottle measurement (qualifier value),Notation: drainage bottle measurement,"In a notation context, this identifies the measurement notation as drainage bottle measurement, specifying the source/method only. It is a Qualifier value and exactly matches SCTID 258018007. Broader parent qualifiers lack specificity, and siblings that name other measurement sources would be incorrect. The entry does not imply numerical results, timing, or device inventory; thus, observable or physical object hierarchies are less suitable."
309952006,Chemical pathology department (environment),Diagnostic report header: Chemical Pathology department,"This phrase indicates the department name appearing in a report header, identifying the Chemical Pathology department as the related environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 309952006 is the correct code because the concept is the specific department. Broader parents or related laboratory/service siblings would not reflect the exact departmental location. The report context does not add attributes that change the concept; it remains a departmental environment reference."
428567001,Gestation 14 - 20 weeks (finding),Pregnancy at 14–20 weeks' gestation,"This statement conveys the identical clinical finding: the pregnancy is in the 14–20 week gestational interval. It maps to the Clinical finding category and corresponds to SNOMED CT 428567001. Using the phrase 'pregnancy at ... gestation' is a clinically standard paraphrase for gestational age and does not imply estimation or add timing beyond the stated range. Parent concepts are too general, child concepts naming a single week are too narrow, and other ranges or trimester labels would not match this exact 14–20 week window."
434398001,Dactylosporangium fulvum (organism),Literature review subject: Dactylosporangium fulvum,"The entry cites Dactylosporangium fulvum as the subject of a literature review, which is a non-clinical context naming the organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No clinical state, detection, or causality is implied, so finding or disorder codes would be inappropriate. Parent concepts are too broad and sibling species do not match the named taxon. The species-level organism concept is the correct and precise code."
34261000087105,Dispatch location (environment),Call record label: dispatch location,"In the call record context, the term “dispatch location” still solely denotes the environmental/geographical location associated with dispatch. No additional attributes (e.g., origin/destination, agency type, time) are conveyed. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the precise code selection is Dispatch location (environment) [34261000087105]. Using a broader location concept would reduce specificity, while selecting a sibling child like dispatch center would add unwarranted specificity."
469418008,Eye muscle clamp (physical object),Eye muscle clamp (surgical instrument),"The entry names the device and clarifies it is a surgical instrument, which correctly characterizes the eye muscle clamp as a Physical object. This directly aligns with the FSN and maps to 469418008. The added parenthetical does not introduce attributes beyond the proper classification. It is not a general ophthalmic clamp nor an eyelid device, making parent or sibling codes less precise than this specific eye muscle clamp code."
242777003,Accident caused by explosion (event),ED note: accident caused by explosion,"This emergency department documentation phrase maintains the core concept: an accident caused by an explosion. The setting label ('ED note') does not add attributes affecting coding. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 242777003 is appropriate, whereas parent concepts lack the causal detail and child concepts with specific explosion types or locales are not indicated."
216975009,Mechanical failure of instrument or apparatus during transfusion (event),Apparatus failed mechanically while transfusion was being administered,"This sentence states that the apparatus had a mechanical failure during the administration of a transfusion. The category is Event. It precisely fits SCTID 216975009 due to the combination of mechanical failure and transfusion context. No specific device, electrical cause, severity, or consequences are added. A parent concept would omit the transfusion timing, and child concepts (e.g., pump-specific failure) are not supported by the text. The phrasing uses clinically safe synonyms without altering the semantic scope."
64285002,Electromagnetic radiation in the microwave region (physical force),Microwave-band EMR,"EMR is a standard abbreviation for electromagnetic radiation; paired with 'microwave-band,' it uniquely indicates the microwave spectrum. Category: Physical force. The entry does not add attributes or context beyond the spectral region. It is more precise than the general EM radiation parent and avoids siblings in non-microwave bands, supporting SCTID 64285002 as the most accurate mapping."
702831009,Child and adolescent medicine clinic (environment),Adolescent and child medicine clinic,"This entry reorders the age groups but still signifies a clinic providing medical services to children and adolescents, matching the intended environment concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment because it specifies a care setting. No extraneous attributes (e.g., well-child, mental health, primary care designation, inpatient/outpatient qualifiers) are present. It is more precise than the parent Clinic (environment) and not appropriately mapped to pediatric-only or adolescent-only clinic siblings because both populations are explicitly included. The reordering is a clinically equivalent paraphrase, justifying SCTID 702831009."
112720007,"Application of body cast, shoulder to hips (procedure)","Operative note: application of body cast, shoulders to hips","This operative documentation describes the application of a body cast covering shoulders to hips. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The phrasing mirrors the preferred term and maps exactly to SCTID 112720007. Parent procedures without specified extent or sibling procedures with different coverage would be less accurate. No extra attributes are present, keeping the code selection precise."
1365795009,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with mandible postured forward (record artifact),Summary: extraoral photograph of right hemiface demonstrating mandible postured forward (record artifact).,"This summary states an extraoral photograph of the right hemiface demonstrating the mandible postured forward and explicitly marks it as a record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It aligns directly with the concept; parent concepts that are more generic or sibling concepts with different laterality or modality would not match as precisely. The terms used (“photograph,” “hemiface,” “mandible postured forward”) are clinically equivalent to the preferred wording and do not introduce new attributes."
736393001,Colposcopy care plan (record artifact),Colposcopy care plan on file,"Stating that the colposcopy care plan is on file indicates the presence of the care plan record artifact, precisely mapping to Colposcopy care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736393001. The entry does not imply scheduling, ordering, or performing a procedure; it describes the existence of a documentation artifact. Record artifact is the correct SNOMED category. More general parents (Care plan) lack specific focus, and siblings that represent planned procedures or notes not tied to a care plan would be less appropriate. The phrase is a safe synonym indicating the care plan record."
10989151000119104,History of lung collapse therapy (situation),Past therapeutic lung collapse.,"This wording describes a prior therapeutic action to collapse the lung, consistent with lung collapse therapy in the patient’s history. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The most accurate mapping is “History of lung collapse therapy (situation)” since the phrase conveys a historical therapy rather than a current problem. A generic parent (e.g., “History of therapy”) lacks specificity, and child/sibling concepts naming particular techniques are not mentioned. “Therapeutic lung collapse” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of lung collapse therapy."
9336009,"Chemical test, qualitative and quantitative (procedure)",Chemical assay—qualitative and quantitative,"“Assay” is a standard synonym in laboratory medicine for a chemical test. The hyphenated qualifier clarifies that both qualitative and quantitative aspects are part of the assay, placing it squarely in the Procedure domain. SCTID 9336009 is the most precise match because it encodes both modalities in a chemical test. Parent “Chemical test (procedure)” lacks this specificity, and sibling concepts for single-modality testing would be incomplete. Using “assay” does not alter clinical intent; it remains equivalent to “test” in this context."
223901006,Suffolk (geographic location),Travel history includes Suffolk.,"This indicates Suffolk as a listed place in the travel history, without qualifiers such as county or country. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location hierarchy). The appropriate code is Suffolk (geographic location) SCTID 223901006, reflecting the named geographic location. More specific jurisdictional concepts are not supported by the text, and the generic parent would be too broad. The travel history context does not alter the underlying geographic concept."
1255929000,Structure of synovial sac within hand (body structure),Structure of synovial sac within hand,"This wording reproduces the preferred term and directly denotes the anatomical structure: a synovium-lined sac in the hand. It is a Body structure concept and maps exactly to SCTID 1255929000. Any parent concept without the 'within hand' location would be less precise, and sibling or child concepts that specify particular synovial sac subtypes (such as bursa or tendon sheath) would be overly specific compared with the neutral 'synovial sac' phrasing."
735986004,Patient written birth plan (record artifact),Patient reports having a written birth plan they authored,"This patient-reported statement indicates the existence of a birth plan that is written and authored by the patient, i.e., a document artifact. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is Patient written birth plan (record artifact) SCTID 735986004. A broader Birth plan artifact omits the authorship specificity; clinician-authored plans or verbal preferences are not appropriate siblings. The wording 'they authored' confirms patient authorship and does not add timing, severity, or associated clinical details."
467134005,Blood pressure long-term ambulatory recorder (physical object),Prolonged ambulatory blood pressure recorder,"Using 'prolonged' maintains the long-term attribute, and 'recorder' keeps the focus on the recording device for ambulatory BP. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 467134005 matches because this clearly identifies the device intended for sustained ambulatory blood pressure recording. A generic recorder would be a broader parent, and an ambulatory monitor would be a sibling concept with different functional emphasis. No additional characteristics are specified."
416329005,Cupriavidus gilardii (organism),Reported as Cupriavidus gilardii,"This phrasing indicates that the reported organism is Cupriavidus gilardii, with no additional qualifiers. The concept is the organism at the species level and should be coded under the Organism hierarchy using SNOMED CT 416329005. No attributes like disease state or location are implied, making parent (genus-level) or sibling species concepts less appropriate than the precise species code."
280661000,Entire posterior pole of eye (body structure),Posterior pole—eye,"The structured label 'Posterior pole—eye' cleanly identifies the anatomical site without additional qualifiers, pointing to the entire posterior pole of the eye and mapping to SCTID 280661000 (Body structure). It is neither broader (e.g., eye or posterior part of eye) nor narrower (e.g., macula or fovea) than the intended concept. Siblings like 'anterior pole of eye' are explicitly different locations; thus this entry is best coded to the provided concept."
396133004,Every four hours while awake (qualifier value),Q4H WA,"In common medication scheduling notation, Q4H indicates every four hours, and WA means while awake; combined, they represent the qualifier value 396133004. The category is Qualifier value, conveying timing/frequency. Removing WA would map to a different qualifier (all-day q4h), and changing the interval would map to a different sibling. The abbreviations are standard, unambiguous in context, and do not introduce extra attributes."
255385008,Hypokinetic (qualifier value),Hypokinetic,"The entry uses the adjective “hypokinetic” as the sole concept, which is a qualitative descriptor of movement or kinesis without adding severity, timing, location, or cause. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 255385008 is the most precise match because it represents the qualitative modifier “hypokinetic” used to characterize reduced motion. Parent or sibling qualifiers like “akinetic” or “hyperkinetic” are inappropriate as they denote absent or increased motion, respectively. Clinical finding concepts such as “hypokinesia” would imply a disorder or observed finding rather than a pure qualifier; this entry is strictly a qualifier, so 255385008 is correct."
113168001,Economically independent (economic status) (social concept),Economic status: independent,"This documentation-style entry specifies the economic status domain and labels it as independent, directly reflecting the concept of economic independence. Category: Social concept. It is best matched to SNOMED CT 113168001 because it states independence within economic status. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings that imply dependence or other economic attributes (e.g., hardship) are not indicated."
49332003,Chiropractic adjustment of multiple cervical spine subluxations (procedure),Chiropractic treatment: adjustment of multiple cervical spine subluxations,"This statement indicates a chiropractic treatment consisting of adjustment of multiple subluxations in the cervical spine. It falls under SNOMED CT Procedure. Even though “treatment” is mentioned, the core action is the adjustment, and the anatomic site and multiplicity are explicit, precisely matching SCTID 49332003. More general chiropractic care entries lacking these details would be under-specified, and entries focused on a single subluxation or different spine regions would misclassify the concept."
422953009,Escherichia coli serogroup O174 (organism),Problem list entry: Escherichia coli serogroup O174,"Although presented as a problem list context, the content itself is only the organism Escherichia coli with serogroup O174 and does not assert disease. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, specifically Escherichia coli serogroup O174 (organism), SCTID 422953009. Coding to a broader Escherichia coli organism would ignore the provided O174 granularity; disorder or infection concepts would add attributes not present here. No H-antigen, specimen, or pathogenicity details are mentioned, so sibling or child concepts are inappropriate. The entry remains a clinically equivalent naming of the O174 serogroup organism."
1179510007,Beta globulin within reference range (finding),Beta globulin measurement normal.,"This indicates that the measurement of beta globulin is normal, synonymous with within the reference range. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 1179510007 is exact. Parent concepts like general globulin findings are too broad, and siblings for abnormal beta globulin are incompatible with “normal.” The term “measurement” is contextual and does not introduce method or specimen attributes."
287851006,Mesenteric lesion excised (situation),Post-op note—mesenteric lesion excised.,"The entry records, in a postoperative context, that a mesenteric lesion has been excised. The key concept is excision status of a lesion in the mesentery. This is a Situation with explicit context. Mesenteric lesion excised (situation) is most precise as it captures the completed excision status. A procedure concept would not be ideal, as the entry documents the result rather than specifying the operation itself. Parent concepts are too nonspecific about location, and any child/sibling introducing technique, timing beyond completed, or pathology would be over-specific. The phrasing adds no extra attributes."
231557007,Orbital tissue volume enhancement (procedure),Augmentation of orbital tissue volume,"This phrasing explicitly states the augmentation (increase) of tissue volume in the orbit, which corresponds directly to the concept. The main medical concept is orbital tissue volume enhancement, categorized as a Procedure. SCTID 231557007 is the precise code, as it does not introduce technique, laterality, or indication. Broader or more specific alternatives (e.g., orbital implant insertion, reconstruction) would not be appropriate since they add attributes not present. The synonym ‘augmentation’ is clinically equivalent to ‘enhancement’ and preserves the intended coding."
723617007,Ages and Stages Questionnaires Social-Emotional second edition score (observable entity),Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social-Emotional second edition scoring result,"This phrase identifies the score resulting from the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social-Emotional second edition (ASQ:SE-2). The concept is an Observable entity. No additional attributes like value, cutoff status, or timing are introduced. Concepts for other instruments or editions (ASQ-3, ASQ:SE first edition) would not fit, confirming SCTID 723617007. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term and does not change the coding."
73588009,Hospital-based laboratory facility (environment),Hospital laboratory environment,"This wording denotes the environment of a laboratory in a hospital and does not add attributes like specialty, department, or service activities. The main concept is the hospital-based laboratory facility as an environmental location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It matches SCTID 73588009 because the phrase captures both the hospital context and the laboratory facility. Broader parent concepts (Hospital environment or Laboratory environment) would be less precise, and sibling concepts with departmental or specialized laboratory types are not signaled by the entry. Using 'environment' keeps the focus on the environmental setting and does not change the code selection."
111966009,Brain stem respiratory center function (observable entity),Brainstem respiratory center function (observable),"This entry explicitly labels the concept as an observable, emphasizing it is an attribute to be observed rather than a finding or a procedure. It denotes the function of respiratory centers in the brainstem without adding results or context that would shift the meaning. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Observable entity Brain stem respiratory center function (SCTID 111966009). Broader or different categories—such as disorders or procedures—are not indicated by the wording. The parent or sibling concepts would be less specific or represent different constructs, so this exact code is the best match."
368648008,Entire ceruminous gland (body structure),Glandula ceruminosa—entire,"The Latin term “Glandula ceruminosa” is a synonym for ceruminous gland, and “entire” specifies the whole anatomy. The main concept is the complete ceruminous gland. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This aligns with SCTID 368648008 since it denotes the entire structure; parent terms without the entire qualifier would be less precise. No lateral or pathological attributes are indicated, so no sibling or child concept applies."
716317007,Measurement of intravascular pressure using fluoroscopic guidance with contrast (procedure),Cath lab: intravascular pressure measurement performed using fluoroscopic contrast guidance,"This cath lab context entry reports intravascular pressure measurement and explicitly mentions fluoroscopic guidance with contrast, aligning with the defined technique. Category: Procedure. SNOMED CT code 716317007 is the correct selection because it encodes intravascular pressure measurement under fluoroscopy with contrast. A more generic parent would lack the method, while siblings or children specifying intracardiac measurements or named vessels would be mismatches. The setting (“Cath lab”) does not add attributes beyond the procedure; it remains equivalent to the core concept."
1193842009,Local flap reconstruction by rotation - action (qualifier value),Local rotation flap reconstruction,"This phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym, rearranging the words to express the same method: a local flap reconstruction performed by rotation. The main concept remains the action/technique; no extra attributes like site or timing are added. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It is more precise than the parent action “local flap reconstruction” because it specifies rotation, and it avoids sibling actions such as advancement or transposition. The synonym does not introduce new meaning; it retains local flap, reconstruction, and rotation, keeping the code SCTID 1193842009 as the correct match."
77530007,(S)-2-methylmalate dehydratase (substance),S-2-methylmalate dehydratase enzyme,"This phrasing identifies the same biochemical substance and clarifies its nature as an enzyme without adding extra attributes. The core concept is '(S)-2-methylmalate dehydratase', a Substance in SNOMED CT (77530007). Using 'S-' instead of '(S)' is a stylistic variant for the stereochemical descriptor and remains equivalent in meaning. A parent concept like 'enzyme' would be too general, and a sibling like '(R)-2-methylmalate dehydratase' would be incorrect. Therefore, the most precise match remains the substance '(S)-2-methylmalate dehydratase'."
371265003,Vivid color saturation (qualifier value),Technician comment: vivid color saturation,"The entry records a technician’s observation that the 'color saturation' is 'vivid'. Context does not introduce extra attributes; it remains a qualitative descriptor of saturation intensity. As a Qualifier value, it maps precisely to 'Vivid color saturation'. Parent terms are nonspecific, and sibling degrees do not match the term 'vivid'."
312061002,Product containing electrolyte (product),Patient reports using an electrolyte product,"This patient-reported statement identifies a product with electrolyte content without specifying formulation or particular electrolyte, which fits “Product containing electrolyte (product).” Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The wording does not introduce additional attributes such as route, strength, brand, or indication, making parent concepts too broad and child concepts too narrow for the stated level of detail."
16153005,"Fast axoplasmic transport, function (observable entity)",Rapid axoplasmic flow function,"The synonym 'rapid' for 'fast' and 'axoplasmic flow' for axoplasmic transport preserves the intended meaning—a function observable of the fast transport mechanism—matching SNOMED CT 16153005. A parent without speed specification would be less specific, and siblings for slow flow function or quantitative flow rate are not implied. No additional attributes such as abnormality, direction, or measurement values are present."
432981006,Specimen from eye obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Fine-needle aspirate biopsy specimen of the eye,"The wording defines a specimen from the eye obtained via fine-needle aspirate (biopsy), which is synonymous with FNA biopsy. Category: Specimen. It exactly fits the concept for an eye specimen collected by fine needle aspiration biopsy. Using “fine-needle aspirate” as a synonym does not alter the method and does not introduce additional attributes. Broader or alternative site concepts would be less precise, and no child-level specificity is included, supporting code 432981006."
41355003,Ultraviolet radiation (physical force),Ultraviolet spectrum radiation,"This entry refers to radiation within the ultraviolet spectrum, which is synonymous with ultraviolet radiation as a Physical force. It maps to 41355003, avoiding introduction of attributes such as exposure, therapeutic application, or specific wavelength classes. Parent concepts (e.g., Electromagnetic radiation) are too broad, and sibling or child UV subtypes are not specified, preserving the appropriateness of the generic UV radiation concept."
734929001,Video intubation laryngoscope blade (physical object),OR supply: video intubation laryngoscope blade,"Within operating room supply context, the item is the video-intubation laryngoscope blade. No additional attributes are introduced. This is a Physical object and maps accurately to SCTID 734929001. Using a parent concept would be less specific, and picking the sibling 'Video laryngoscope' would miscode to the whole device. The context label does not alter the object identity or code."
217931003,Accidentally struck by machinery (event),Unintentional strike by machine,"This entry conveys the same event with 'unintentional' as a synonym for 'accidental,' and 'strike by machine' equals 'struck by machinery.' It is an Event and the most precise match is SCTID 217931003. Parent concepts are broader and omit the machinery mechanism, while sibling concepts (caught/crushed by machinery, contact with machinery) describe different types of incidents. The phrasing avoids details like injury severity, body site, or setting."
256377006,Red cells - CMV negative (product),Documented CMV-negative packed red blood cells,"The entry documents a blood Product comprising packed red blood cells that are CMV negative. In clinical usage, packed red blood cells are equivalent to red cell components, so the SNOMED CT Product concept Red cells - CMV negative (product), SCTID 256377006 is the precise match. Because no additional processing attributes are introduced, sibling or child concepts (irradiated, washed) are not appropriate, and a parent non-CMV-specific RBC product would be too broad."
77086004,Genus Corynebacterium (organism),"Corynebacterium (organism, taxonomic genus)","This phrase designates Corynebacterium as an organism at the taxonomic rank of genus, with no mention of detection, species, or disease. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 77086004 is the most precise match. Broader parent concepts or narrower species-level children would not fit the text. The synonym is a straightforward restatement of the preferred term."
420130002,Fluoroscopic angiography of internal iliac artery with contrast (procedure),Contrast fluoroscopic arteriography of the internal iliac artery,"This phrasing clearly indicates arteriography (arterial angiography) of the internal iliac artery using fluoroscopy with contrast, which is precisely SCTID 420130002. The main concept is a contrast-enhanced fluoroscopic imaging procedure focused on the internal iliac artery; it avoids laterality, selectivity, or therapeutic details. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. “Arteriography” is an accepted synonym in this arterial context, and “contrast fluoroscopic” captures the modality and contrast requirement. Broader parent codes or siblings (e.g., external/common iliac angiography, CT/MR angiography) are not appropriate. The exact vessel and modality ensure a unique and correct mapping."
443723009,Repair of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection by baffle redirection to left atrium with reimplantation of systemic vein in right atrium (procedure),Operative note: PAPVC repaired by baffle redirection to the left atrium; systemic vein reimplanted to the right atrium.,"The operative note documents PAPVC repair with baffle redirection to the left atrium and reimplantation of a systemic vein to the right atrium, which are the salient technical elements of SCTID 443723009. This is a Procedure entry. It avoids naming a specific systemic vein or appendage that could imply a more specific sibling (e.g., a named technique), and it is more specific than a general PAPVC repair because it includes both baffle and reimplantation steps, thereby matching the concept precisely."
288562003,Secure unit (environment),Transfer destination: secure unit,"The entry specifies the secure unit as the target environment for a transfer. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The wording does not introduce attributes such as type of care, security level, or specialty; consequently, the base concept “Secure unit (environment)” SCTID 288562003 is the best fit. Broader locations like hospital unit would be less precise, and specialized secure units are not implied."
74226000,Product containing vitamin K and/or vitamin K derivative (product),Vitamin K or vitamin K analog product,"By stating vitamin K or a vitamin K analog (a clinically accepted synonym for derivative), the entry aligns with SNOMED CT 74226000. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It maintains generality, avoiding specific ingredient forms, route, or dosage. Parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling options specifying particular analogs (e.g., menadione) or dosage forms would be overly specific relative to the wording. The use of “analog” is clinically equivalent to “derivative” and does not alter code selection."
367561004,Xenon arc photocoagulator (physical object),Xenon arc photocoagulator system,"Calling it a 'system' still identifies the same device ensemble providing xenon arc photocoagulation; this does not introduce a different subtype. It belongs to Physical object (device). Specifying 'xenon arc photocoagulator' keeps it narrower than parent photocoagulator system concepts and avoids siblings that use different energy sources (e.g., laser). It is not a procedure and not merely a xenon arc lamp component, so the xenon arc photocoagulator device concept is the precise match."
7087005,Intermittent (qualifier value),Intermittent pattern,"This phrase expresses the temporal pattern as 'intermittent' without adding any other attribute. The concept falls under Qualifier value and is best represented by SNOMED CT 7087005. Parent concepts like 'temporal pattern (qualifier)' would be overly generic, and sibling qualifiers such as 'continuous' or 'periodic' are not appropriate. 'Pattern' simply frames the qualifier context and does not change code selection."
717039007,Test of Word Knowledge score (observable entity),Vocabulary assessment: Test of Word Knowledge score,"While it mentions the domain (vocabulary assessment), the key concept is the TOWK score. This is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT. SCTID 717039007 is the correct code, since it denotes the score for the named test. Parents like general vocabulary test score are less specific, and siblings such as the TOWK procedure or distinct score variants (percentile, raw) are not implied. The wording is a synonymous paraphrase that maintains equivalence to the base concept."
249139003,Thick meconium draining with liquor (finding),Viscous meconium present in draining liquor,"The term 'viscous' is a clinically accepted synonym for thick consistency, and the phrase states meconium is present in liquor that is draining, which constitutes a Clinical finding. This exactly maps to 'Thick meconium draining with liquor.' Concepts that omit thickness (parent) or specify thin meconium (sibling) would not be as accurate. The synonym 'viscous' does not introduce new attributes; it conveys the same consistency as 'thick.'"
55606002,Structure of transverse process of fourth thoracic vertebra (body structure),Anatomy: transverse process of the fourth thoracic vertebra,"Prefacing with 'Anatomy:' does not alter the core content, which is the transverse process of the fourth thoracic vertebra, a Body structure. This is the precise target of the SNOMED concept. Parents without T4 designation are overly general; children specifying laterality go beyond the entry’s detail; siblings at other levels are excluded by naming the fourth thoracic vertebra."
118821000181106,Pseudarthrobacter phenanthrenivorans (organism),Pseudarthrobacter phenanthrenivorans bacterium,"Adding the descriptor “bacterium” does not change the concept; it remains the specific bacterial species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 118821000181106 is the exact representation. Mapping to parent concepts like “Bacterium” or “Pseudarthrobacter (organism)” would lose specificity, and sibling species would be incorrect. No clinical attributes are present."
275656009,"Stat B,C and F cremation certs (record artifact)","Forms B, C & F — cremation certificates (statutory)","This entry identifies the exact set of statutory cremation certificates as forms B, C, and F, matching the targeted record artifact. The dash and parenthetical text do not introduce clinical attributes; they clarify the synonymy of forms with certificates. As a Record artifact, this is the precise SNOMED concept, whereas a parent like generic cremation documentation lacks the specific triad, and siblings focused on individual forms would be incomplete."
702847006,Dermatology clinic (environment),Dermatology clinic location,"This entry identifies the dermatology clinic as a location, which is an environment construct. The precise SNOMED CT match is Dermatology clinic (environment) [702847006]. More generic parents like Clinic (environment) are too broad, and any department/service terminology would shift to organization. No timing or causal attributes are present. The 'location' phrasing is a safe synonym reflecting the environment category."
282420001,Entire sixth costochondral junction (body structure),Full extent of the sixth costochondral junction,"“Full extent” is a synonymic way to convey the complete (entire) anatomical junction at the sixth rib. Category: Body structure. SCTID 282420001 is the correct code, capturing the whole junction. Broader parent concepts or narrower substructures (rib or cartilage alone) would be mismatches, and lateralized children would add attributes not stated. The phrasing does not alter the concept."
309110000,Bursa tissue specimen (specimen),Specimen: bursa tissue,"This entry documents the specimen type as tissue from a bursa, without adding attributes such as specific anatomical bursa, laterality, or collection method. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The phrase aligns with “Bursa tissue specimen” (SCTID 309110000). Choosing a broader parent like “Tissue specimen” would lose the bursa specificity, and a sibling such as “Bursa fluid specimen” would be incorrect because the material is tissue rather than fluid. The phrasing is a standard lab listing and is clinically equivalent."
428119001,Procedure not indicated (situation),Procedure is not indicated,"The sentence states that the procedure, in general, is not indicated, capturing the same situation of absent indication. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It corresponds to 428119001 because it reflects a context-based clinical decision that no procedure is warranted, without specifying type, timing, or cause. Parent or child concepts are not more precise since no specific procedure is named. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent and maintains the same coding intent."
897202005,Gleason scoring system for malignant neoplasm of prostate (staging scale),Pathology report references the Gleason scoring system for the patient’s prostate cancer,"This documentation context states that the pathology report cites the Gleason scoring system for prostate cancer, which corresponds to the scale concept SCTID 897202005. The main concept is the named scale; the attribute is its application to malignant neoplasm of the prostate. Category: Staging scale (qualifier/assessment scale). It does not provide a score or grade, avoiding child finding concepts. Other staging systems are not mentioned, so sibling codes are less appropriate. 'Prostate cancer' is a synonymous clinical expression for 'malignant neoplasm of prostate.'"
419141006,Magnesium glycinate (substance),Ingredient listed: magnesium glycinate,"Listing magnesium glycinate as an ingredient still targets the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the exact code Magnesium glycinate (substance), SCTID 419141006. Generic magnesium would be too broad, and any other magnesium salt or chelate is a sibling that contradicts the glycinate specification. The ingredient context does not add extraneous attributes, so the substance code remains the most precise choice."
184850001,Insurance report - travel cancelation (record artifact),Travel insurance report: cancellation of trip,"The entry denotes a report within the travel insurance domain and explicitly states the subject as trip cancellation, aligning with Insurance report - travel cancelation (record artifact). The main concept is a document/report in an insurance context; the attribute is the topic “cancellation of trip.” The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. While “travel insurance” identifies the coverage type, the artifact remains an insurance report and not a policy or claim form. This avoids mapping to the general Insurance report parent and is distinct from sibling artifacts (e.g., claim forms)."
106241006,Gleason grading system for prostatic cancer (staging scale),Gleason scoring system for prostatic cancer,"The entry denotes the Gleason scoring/grading system used to categorize prostate cancer histology. It expresses the scale itself, not a measured score. In SNOMED CT, this is a Staging scale under the Qualifier value hierarchy, best represented by SCTID 106241006. Choosing a parent like “Staging scale” would be non-specific, and selecting a finding such as “Gleason score” would be incorrect because no numeric score is documented. The wording maintains equivalence to the FSN through standard clinical synonyms (“scoring system” vs “grading system”) without adding attributes."
183637009,Transient patient:no follow-up (finding),Visitor patient — no follow-up scheduled.,"“Visitor patient” is a contextually equivalent term to transient patient, and “no follow-up scheduled” asserts the no-follow-up attribute. Together they align with SNOMED CT 183637009 (Clinical finding). Parent concepts such as “Transient patient” alone lack the follow-up detail, and a sibling that includes follow-up scheduling would not match. No additional attributes are introduced."
732211001,Twelve hour urine specimen (specimen),12hr urine specimen,"The main concept is a urine specimen with a 12-hour collection window, written with the common 'hr' abbreviation. This is a Specimen and corresponds to SNOMED CT SCTID 732211001. The abbreviation does not change the meaning and remains clinically equivalent to '12-hour.' Parent concepts (Urine specimen, Timed urine specimen) are less specific. Sibling concepts (24-hour urine specimen, random urine specimen) indicate different durations or collection types and thus do not match. No extra attributes are introduced, maintaining precise coding to Twelve hour urine specimen."
33501000087106,Donor-organ preservation solution specimen (specimen),Organ donor preservation solution specimen,"This phrasing conveys a specimen of preservation solution used for an organ donor, which is equivalent to donor-organ preservation solution. The category is Specimen. It maps most precisely to SCTID 33501000087106, capturing both the donor-organ context and specimen nature. Broader fluid specimen parents or substance/product codes are less specific, and there are no added attributes (organ type, formula, timing) that would necessitate a child concept."
1306649005,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Record photo: extraoral left half facial image, lips closed, teeth in centric occlusion","The entry denotes a record photo artifact—extraoral, focused on the left half of the face—and includes the oral positioning attributes lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion. This is exactly the SNOMED CT Record artifact concept provided. More general parents lack one or more of these constraints, and siblings differ by laterality or mouth/occlusion configuration. The wording is a straightforward synonym set for the original preferred term, without adding timing, cause, or severity, ensuring the most precise match."
224023001,Saskatchewan (geographic location),Saskatchewan (geographic location),"The entry clarifies that the term refers to the geographic entity Saskatchewan. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location), and SCTID 224023001 is the precise code for this province. Parent categories like Geographic location are nonspecific, and siblings or children (other provinces or localities within Saskatchewan) are not implied. The parenthetical descriptor is a synonym clarifier that preserves the same concept."
439516000,Hemodialysis therapy discontinued (situation),Hemodialysis discontinued.,"This entry conveys the same core idea: hemodialysis has been stopped. The concept is a Situation with explicit context, indicating a previously active therapy is no longer being provided. SCTID 439516000 is the most precise match because it refers specifically to discontinuation of hemodialysis therapy. Using a parent like dialysis discontinued would incorrectly generalize to all dialysis modalities, and a sibling such as peritoneal dialysis discontinued would be incorrect. The shortened phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
785333006,Product containing glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor agonist (product),Medication profile entry: GLP-2 receptor agonist drug,"The entry indicates a drug on a medication profile that is a GLP-2 receptor agonist, mapping to SCTID 785333006. The main concept is the pharmaceutical/biologic product classified by pharmacologic action. No additional attributes (specific ingredient, route, strength, or brand) are included, so it does not map to child concepts. Parent nodes would be nonspecific, and sibling classes are inappropriate for GLP-2. The term 'drug' is a clinically equivalent synonym for product and maintains precise coding."
1352534004,Union for International Cancer Control pT3b (qualifier value),Chart lists UICC pT3b,"This indicates that the chart lists UICC pT3b, the pathologic T3b category in UICC TNM. The main concept is UICC pT3b. SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It is an exact match to 1352534004 because it clearly denotes UICC and pT3b without adding organ, laterality, grade, or other staging components. Parent or sibling qualifiers differ in specificity or context and are not appropriate."
118364009,Middle infrared region laser beam (physical force),Laser beam—middle infrared,"This entry denotes a laser beam and immediately qualifies it as middle infrared. The main concept is a spectral-region-specific laser beam, categorized under Physical force. It is best coded to SNOMED CT 118364009, Middle infrared region laser beam. There are no added attributes such as exposure, injury, or procedural use. Using parent concepts like Laser beam or Infrared region laser beam would be less precise, and sibling concepts such as Near infrared laser beam or Far infrared laser beam would not match the wording. The phrasing is a synonymous expression that preserves the intended meaning."
1365869001,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror of right buccal segment with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),Right buccal segment intraoral mirror image (centric relation),"The entry captures the required components: an intraoral photographic image, viewed via mirror, focused on the right buccal segment, with teeth in centric relation. As a Record artifact, this directly corresponds to SCTID 1365869001. Using a general parent like intraoral mirror image without the CR or segment detail would be under-specified, and choosing a sibling such as a left buccal segment or a non-mirror intraoral photo would contradict the text. The parenthetical “centric relation” is a precise attribute consistent with the concept."
264347000,Woods (environment),Wooded area,"This entry identifies a natural area dominated by trees, synonymous with woods/woodland, without extra qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 264347000 is the most appropriate code because the concept is exactly the woods environment. Broader or different environments (e.g., coastal, urban, park) are not indicated. The synonym does not introduce timing, severity, or causal attributes, so code selection remains unchanged."
116536008,Product containing protease (product),Product containing protease,"This entry explicitly indicates a product whose ingredient is protease. The main concept is the product-ingredient relationship, with no extra qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps most precisely to “Product containing protease (product)” because it focuses on the product class defined by the protease ingredient. More general parents like “Product containing enzyme” are not as specific, and children naming individual proteases (e.g., trypsin, papain) or other enzymes (lipase, amylase) would not match. It clearly differs from the substance concept since the wording centers on a product."
278538001,Repair of spinal dysraphism (procedure),Repair of dysraphic spinal defect,"This phrasing indicates a procedure repairing the dysraphic defect in the spine, with no added attributes like patient age, technique, or specific lesion subtype. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 278538001 fits best, as it directly represents repair of spinal dysraphism. Child procedures such as specific closure of myelomeningocele or meningocele are not referenced, and parent concepts like repair of neural tube defect would be overly broad. 'Dysraphic spinal defect' is a synonymous description of spinal dysraphism."
763286004,Wound edge observable (observable entity),Wound edge feature (observable entity),"Using 'feature' expresses an observable aspect of the wound edge without implying any specific finding or measurement outcome. Category: Observable entity. This maps appropriately to SNOMED CT 763286004, which encapsulates the observable features of wound edges. It is more precise than a generic wound observable and does not drift into sibling observables like wound bed features. No attribute or value state is introduced, validating this code selection."
773513001,Physiotherapy care plan (record artifact),Physical therapy plan (care plan),"This identifies a care plan specific to physical therapy, which is clinically synonymous with physiotherapy. The main concept is a record artifact and maps to Physiotherapy care plan (record artifact), SCTID 773513001. Using a generic care plan artifact would be less precise, and concepts for therapy sessions, orders, or referrals would be incorrect. The synonym does not change attributes; it preserves the artifact nature of a physiotherapy care plan."
118345003,High energy laser beam (physical force),Force involved: high energy laser beam,"The phrase states the involved force and names it as a high energy laser beam, representing the physical force only. It adds no attributes like causation, outcome, or body site, maintaining focus on the agent itself. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. The high energy descriptor distinguishes this concept from its parent and from siblings; it is not a device/procedure or an exposure situation."
183960004,Patient refuses hospital admission (situation),Declines hospital admission.,"The verb 'declines' is a clinically equivalent way to express patient refusal of hospital admission. The main concept remains refusal of the admission, with the patient as subject. This is a Situation with explicit context and aligns exactly with 183960004. Broader refusal of care or different siblings (such as refusal of treatment or tests) would not be as precise, as the phrase targets hospital admission specifically. No additional attributes are introduced."
360091001,Neurostimulator electrode (physical object),Neurostimulation electrode,"This is a clinically equivalent synonym referring to the electrode intended for neurostimulation devices. It maps to the SNOMED CT device/physical object concept Neurostimulator electrode (SCTID 360091001). The phrase does not add site, type, or usage details; it simply identifies the electrode used in neurostimulation. More general electrode concepts would be less precise, and site-specific electrodes (e.g., deep brain stimulation electrodes) would be overly specific. The synonym preserves the same code selection."
428349007,Disability of arm (finding),Problem list entry: disability of arm,"The problem-list phrasing denotes the presence of arm disability as an ongoing clinical finding. It should be coded to SNOMED CT 428349007 (Clinical finding). Parents like “Disability of limb” or “Disability of upper limb” are overly general, while siblings such as “arm weakness” or “loss of arm function” would introduce specific functional deficits not stated here. The entry remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
736250004,Respite care plan (record artifact),"Care plan labeled ""Respite care""","This entry identifies a care plan whose label indicates respite care as its focus, which is a documented plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the most precise code is Respite care plan (record artifact) [736250004]. Mapping to a generic care plan would lose specificity, and sibling concepts like referral notes or service provision would be incorrect because the entry denotes a plan rather than an action. The labeling detail does not change the underlying concept or add attributes."
736395008,Hysteroscopy care plan (record artifact),Clinical care plan: hysteroscopy,"The phrase conveys a clinical care plan specifically for hysteroscopy, which is a documented plan. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. “Clinical care plan” is a synonym for care plan and does not change the core semantics to ordering or performing the procedure. Therefore, Hysteroscopy care plan (record artifact) SCTID 736395008 is the correct code, avoiding broader parents or sibling concepts like Hysteroscopy planned (situation)."
395929002,Zopiclone (substance),Zopiclone,"Main concept is the specific chemical entity zopiclone, with no additional attributes stated. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance. This maps most precisely to Zopiclone (substance) [395929002] because the entry names the active chemical itself without dose, form, brand, administration, or clinical context. Parent concepts such as broader hypnotic agents or nonbenzodiazepine sedatives would be too generic, and child or sibling concepts like eszopiclone (the S‑enantiomer) or zopiclone-containing medicinal products would introduce product- or isomer-specific detail not present here."
737430008,Congestive heart failure clinical management plan (record artifact),CHF clinical management plan,"This entry denotes a clinical management plan for CHF, using a common abbreviation where CHF is a well-recognized synonym for congestive heart failure. The artifact described is a plan, fitting the Record artifact category and mapping to SCTID 737430008. It does not introduce clinical details beyond the existence of the plan for the specified condition. A generic clinical management plan without condition would be a parent concept and less precise; similarly, selecting a disorder code for CHF or a procedure for managing CHF would be incorrect because the text refers to the plan documentation."
51313001,Genus Celastrus (organism),Consultation note mentions Celastrus (genus),"The mention identifies Celastrus at the genus level without additional qualifiers. SNOMED CT’s Organism concept Genus Celastrus (SCTID 51313001) is the best match. No species are indicated, avoiding mapping to child concepts, and no higher taxon is invoked, avoiding parents. The consultation context is incidental and does not introduce attributes such as exposure or reaction."
441601000124106,Diabetic high calorie high protein enteral formula with fiber (product),Dietary product: diabetic high-calorie high-protein enteral formula with fiber,"This entry denotes a dietary product that is an enteral formula tailored for diabetic use, with high-calorie and high-protein characteristics and fiber. It is a Product concept and matches SCTID 441601000124106. Broader parent concepts (e.g., any diabetic enteral product) or sibling products lacking fiber or macronutrient specifications would not capture the full semantics present."
1287108001,Optometry clinic (environment),Service setting documented as optometry clinic,"This wording records the service setting and identifies it specifically as an optometry clinic, which is an environment designation. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The exact match is 1287108001 Optometry clinic (environment); general clinic settings are less precise, and specialty siblings like ophthalmology are not indicated. The documentation context does not alter the concept or add new attributes."
127464006,Tissue specimen from esophagus (specimen),Specimen: esophageal tissue,"This entry is a common label-style documentation indicating that the specimen consists of tissue and is from the esophagus. It corresponds to Tissue specimen from esophagus (specimen) SCTID 127464006 (Specimen). No additional attributes such as laterality, subsite, extent, or acquisition method are introduced, excluding children like resection or biopsy specimens. It is more granular than parent 'esophageal specimen' concepts because it explicitly states tissue as the material."
439660008,Thermotoga maritima (organism),Thermotoga maritima — species-level organism,"The entry emphasizes that the named entity Thermotoga maritima is a species-level organism, without any clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact code is Thermotoga maritima (organism), SCTID 439660008. Using a parent like Thermotoga (genus) would lack specificity, and selecting a sibling species would misidentify the organism. No strain details or clinical conditions are provided, so child or disorder concepts are not indicated. The descriptor ""species-level organism"" is an acceptable paraphrase that maintains equivalence to the organism concept."
719633001,Structure of coracoid process of left scapula (body structure),Documented anatomy: left shoulder blade's coracoid process,"This entry documents an anatomical structure, the coracoid process of the left shoulder blade, using 'shoulder blade' as a synonym for scapula while retaining laterality and substructure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches SCTID 719633001 exactly. A non-lateral parent concept would be less specific, and child structures such as particular surfaces or ridges of the coracoid are not indicated. The patient-friendly synonym does not alter code selection."
331534000,Emollient bath additives (product),"Bath additive, emollient","This phrasing conveys a bath additive that is specifically emollient, identifying the product type without extra qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The most precise match is 331534000 Emollient bath additives (product), since the wording explicitly combines 'bath additive' and 'emollient'. A parent concept like Bath additive (product) would be too broad, and a sibling such as Emollient cream would be a different dosage form. The re-ordered synonym remains clinically equivalent and does not introduce new attributes."
367878004,Entire substantia gelatinosa of thoracic spinal cord posterior horn (body structure),Complete lamina II of thoracic dorsal horn,"The phrase uses lamina II (a standard synonym for substantia gelatinosa), specifies the thoracic dorsal horn, and indicates “complete,” so it refers to the entire structure. It is a Body structure concept. SNOMED CT SCTID 367878004 is the precise code, as it denotes the entire substantia gelatinosa of the thoracic posterior horn. Parent concepts like generic lamina II or dorsal horn without thoracic delineation are too broad, while siblings at other spinal levels or non-entire variants do not match the wording. The synonym lamina II is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
358248000,Basic bicarbonate hemodialysis dry concentrate (product),Hemodialysis product: basic bicarbonate dry concentrate,"The entry specifies a hemodialysis product and identifies it as a basic bicarbonate dry concentrate, conveying component and formulation. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 358248000 is the exact match. Parent or sibling concepts lacking the dry form or basic component, or referencing acid concentrate, would not be precise enough."
42115006,Open reduction of closed traumatic hip dislocation (procedure),The record shows an open reduction of closed traumatic hip dislocation,"This entry indicates that the medical record documents an open reduction for a closed traumatic dislocation of the hip. The main concept is the operative reduction via open approach; attributes are hip dislocation, closed injury, and traumatic etiology. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The content precisely aligns with the named SNOMED concept; selecting a parent like Reduction of hip dislocation would omit key qualifiers, and siblings with different approaches or injury types would be inaccurate. The documentation phrasing does not change the procedure coded."
473292004,Psychotic symptom rating scales auditory hallucination subscale emotional characteristics score (observable entity),PSYRATS AH subscale emotional characteristics score updated,"This indicates an update to the emotional characteristics score on the PSYRATS AH subscale, still referring to the same Observable entity as SCTID: 473292004. The status term “updated” does not alter the domain or introduce new attributes. Broader parent concepts would include the entire AH subscale score, while narrower siblings or single items do not match the emotional characteristics score domain. The synonym remains clinically equivalent and precise."
128731000119101,History of Guillain Barre syndrome (situation),History of GBS,"This concise entry utilizes the common abbreviation for Guillain-Barré syndrome and clearly situates it as a history item. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It maps directly to 128731000119101, as it indicates prior GBS rather than a current disorder. More general historical concepts lack specificity, and the GBS disorder code would incorrectly imply active disease."
729346000,Entire nerve to sternomastoid (body structure),Imaging report: nerve to sternomastoid visualized,"The imaging context notes visualization of the anatomical nerve branch to the sternomastoid. The main concept remains the nerve structure itself, with no qualifiers such as normality or pathology. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The best code is ‘Entire nerve to sternomastoid’ (729346000). Mapping to parent structures like accessory nerve or to different branches would be incorrect, and adding side or condition would imply child concepts not present in the entry."
260450008,Lordotic projection (qualifier value),Technique: lordotic projection,"This notes the imaging technique in terms of projection and specifies lordotic, which functions as a projection qualifier. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is the Qualifier value 260450008. The entry does not add site, modality nuances beyond projection orientation, or timing. A broader technique or projection parent would be too general, and other projection siblings are not mentioned; no child specificity is present."
223960009,Arran (geographic location),Work location: Arran,"The wording provides occupational context but specifies Arran as the location. Under SNOMED CT, Arran is classified as a Geographic location, and Arran (geographic location) [223960009] is the exact code. The entry does not introduce larger or smaller place qualifiers, ensuring that parent or child/sibling concepts are inapplicable. The occupational context does not alter the place being coded."
57121005,Structure of anterior descending branch of left pulmonary artery (body structure),Left pulmonary artery’s anterior descending branch,"The possessive construction denotes the anterior descending branch belonging to the left pulmonary artery, the same anatomical entity. It introduces no non-anatomical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This is the precise concept of SCTID 57121005. Parent concepts or other branches are less specific, and the pulmonary artery context distinguishes it from coronary structures."
53957002,Carcharhinus longimanus (organism),History note: species noted—Carcharhinus longimanus,"The entry records the species in a history note, limited to naming the organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The binomial Carcharhinus longimanus directly aligns with concept 53957002. Broader parent categories (e.g., Shark) or alternative species would be less precise, and no attributes like exposure or injury are added, supporting the organism code."
223522008,Central African Republic (geographic location),Place name: Central African Republic,"The label clarifies that the term is a place name; the content is the country. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223522008 matches the country precisely. The entry does not extend to a broader regional concept or narrow to a sub-location, and it adds no clinical attributes, keeping the code selection straightforward."
45972007,Stray voltage (physical force),Documented stray voltage,"The entry states that stray voltage has been documented, focusing on the phenomenon itself and avoiding any added attributes like cause, severity, or exposure. It belongs to the Physical force category and maps to Stray voltage (physical force) [45972007]. Parent concepts such as Electrical voltage would be overly generic, and siblings referring to shock or particular voltage magnitudes are not supported by the wording. 'Documented' is a context descriptor and does not alter the coding."
257912008,Rotation - action (qualifier value),Rotation - action,"The entry explicitly states the action term 'Rotation - action' and contains no other attributes such as site, direction, or timing. The main concept is the performance of rotation as an action. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. This wording matches the precise qualifier value 'Rotation - action' used to specify the procedural action component. Parent concepts like generic 'Action' are too broad, and more specific children or siblings that introduce direction (e.g., internal or external rotation) or anatomy would add attributes not present here. No synonym is used; the phrase exactly corresponds to the intended code."
139751000119100,History of benign mandibular ameloblastoma (situation),Past medical history: benign ameloblastoma of the mandible.,"This entry records a prior diagnosis (past medical history) of a benign ameloblastoma specifically involving the mandible. The category is Situation, indicating historical context rather than current disease. It precisely aligns with SCTID 139751000119100 because it includes the benign nature and mandibular site. Broader parent/sibling concepts without site or without the benign qualifier would be less specific, and the active disorder concept would be inappropriate because the phrase indicates past history."
112070001,Onset of labor induced (finding),Induced labor onset documented,"This documentation statement identifies the finding that the onset of labor was induced, without adding method or cause. It is a Clinical finding that fits SNOMED CT 112070001. Using a parent finding would omit the induced qualifier. Sibling 'spontaneous onset' is incompatible with the text. A procedure code for induction is not chosen since the entry records the onset status, not the procedure performed."
143461000119107,Family history of malignant neoplasm of breast in first degree relative less than 50 years of age (situation),History reviewed—first-degree relative diagnosed with malignant breast tumor prior to 50.,"This is a history context describing an FDR with malignant breast tumor diagnosed before 50, meeting all attributes of the concept. The main concept is family history of malignant neoplasm of breast in an FDR <50. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. 'Malignant breast tumor' is clinically equivalent terminology. Using a parent concept without age or first-degree specificity would be less precise, and sibling concepts for other cancers or relative degrees do not apply. No extraneous attributes are present."
425804000,Specimen obtained by wide resection (specimen),Resection specimen (wide),"The phrase indicates a resection specimen and clarifies the extent as wide, aligning with SCTID 425804000. Main concept: specimen from a wide resection. Category: Specimen. The parent “Specimen obtained by resection” lacks the ‘wide’ qualifier and would be less precise. Terms like ‘wide excision’ or ‘marginal resection’ would be siblings, but this entry keeps the exact wide resection procurement, so the code selection remains the same."
1148635007,Measured quantity of intake of thiamine in 24 hours (observable entity),Dietitian note—measured quantity of 24-hour thiamine intake.,"This states the measured quantity of thiamine intake within 24 hours, with a dietitian note as context. The core concept is an Observable entity for the measured quantity of thiamine intake in 24 hours, aligning with SCTID 1148635007. The wording does not imply estimation, recommendations, or deficiency, making broader or alternative concepts inappropriate. The timeframe and nutrient are explicit and correct."
608972000,Adult of Hymenolepis nana (organism),Report lists adult Hymenolepis nana,"In a reporting context, the item 'adult Hymenolepis nana' still denotes the organism and its adult stage, which corresponds to the SNOMED CT Organism concept 'Adult of Hymenolepis nana' (608972000). The category is Organism. The entry avoids specifying clinical findings or sample details, keeping it at the organism identification level. The adult-stage specification ensures it is not the generic H. nana organism nor a different lifecycle stage."
216339001,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, industrial place and premises (environment)",Place of occurrence of accident/poisoning: industrial place and premises,"The entry explicitly records the place where an accident or poisoning occurred as “industrial place and premises,” matching the SNOMED CT environment concept 216339001. Category: Environment or geographical location (environment). It identifies only the location of occurrence without adding mechanism, severity, timing, laterality, or specific industrial subtypes. The parent concept “place of occurrence of accident or poisoning” would be too general, while child or sibling values like factory, mine, construction site, or residential premises would be too specific or incorrect given the wording. The phrasing is a direct restatement of the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
261287007,Cox (qualifier value),Technique: Cox,"The entry denotes 'Cox' as a technique label, consistent with a generic named qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It matches SCTID 261287007 because no additional attributes such as statistical type, hazard specification, or procedural details are given. Parent concepts for unnamed techniques are too broad, and child or sibling concepts, including any Cox-labeled procedures or specific regression models, are not implied here."
65700004,Salmonella Calabar (organism),Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Calabar,"This detailed taxonomic name specifies the subspecies enterica and the serovar Calabar, which still maps exactly to the organism concept Salmonella Calabar, SNOMED CT 65700004. No clinical attributes (e.g., infection, site, timing) are added, so Organism is the correct category. A parent concept like Salmonella enterica would omit the serovar detail, and sibling serovars would not match. The expanded taxonomy is a clinically safe synonym and maintains the same coding target."
298233001,Entire proctodeum (body structure),Structure: proctodeum,"The phrasing identifies the structure by name, 'proctodeum', without additional qualifiers. This matches the body structure concept Entire proctodeum (body structure) SCTID 298233001. It avoids ambiguous regional terms and does not conflate with distinct structures like the proctodeal membrane or anal canal. Hence, it codes precisely to the proctodeum as a whole."
102417007,Soil pollution (event),Soil pollution event recorded,"This states that a soil pollution event has been recorded, keeping the concept strictly to soil pollution without specifying agents or circumstances. The main concept is soil pollution, and the SNOMED CT category is Event. The precise code is Soil pollution (event), SCTID 102417007. Parent concepts are too general, and any child specifying the nature of the pollutant is unsupported. The phrase uses the word ""event"" explicitly, consistent with the hierarchy, and does not change the code selection."
1331904007,Informed clinical opinion document (record artifact),Informed medical opinion document,"The phrase denotes a document that contains an informed professional (medical/clinical) opinion. In SNOMED CT, this best aligns with Informed clinical opinion document (record artifact), a Record artifact. The term “medical” here is a safe, commonly used synonym for “clinical” in this context and does not introduce additional attributes or change the purpose. Sibling concepts like consultation report or expert witness report include other contextual elements; the entry’s focus remains the informed opinion document, justifying this precise code."
223841003,Islands in region of Portugal (geographic location),Islands within Portugal's region,"This phrase points to the islands contained within the regional entity of Portugal, without naming any specific islands. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. Code 223841003 is the most precise match, as it encodes the Portuguese regional islands collectively. A parent like “Portugal” or “Portugal (country)” is too broad, while specifying “Azores” or “Madeira” would be too narrow. The wording is a safe paraphrase and does not add any attributes beyond location."
398156002,Medical or surgical floor (environment),Service location: medical-surgical ward,"The service location is documented as the medical-surgical ward, i.e., the medical/surgical floor environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This is an equivalent synonym and does not add attributes such as level of care beyond the combined med-surg context. SCTID 398156002 best fits. Parents (generic ward) are insufficiently specific, and siblings (medical-only ward, surgical-only ward, ICU, telemetry) would misrepresent the stated environment."
699868006,Suture material submitted as specimen (specimen),Suture thread submitted as specimen.,"This entry uses the synonym “suture thread” to denote suture material and specifies it is the specimen, with no added attributes. The main concept is suture material in specimen form. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Code 699868006 is appropriate because it specifically captures suture material submitted as a specimen. Parents are too general, and siblings involving other devices or tissues are incorrect. “Suture thread” is a clinically safe synonym for suture material and does not change the intended concept."
704795006,"Medical gas delivery line filter, endoscopy (physical object)","Medical gas delivery line filter, endoscopy","The entry explicitly names a filter that is part of a medical gas delivery line and specifies its endoscopy use. The main concept is a physical device (filter) integrated in the gas delivery line for endoscopic procedures. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This is the most precise match to the concept “Medical gas delivery line filter, endoscopy” because it captures both the device type (gas line filter) and the procedural domain (endoscopy). Broader parents such as a general “Medical gas delivery line filter” lack the endoscopy specialization, and siblings like generic “Filter device” or “Endoscopy equipment” are less specific. The wording is identical to the preferred term and does not introduce any additional attributes."
736254008,Psychiatry care plan (record artifact),Psychiatry care plan (record artifact),"The parentheses explicitly note the SNOMED semantic tag, reinforcing that this is the document artifact capturing a psychiatry care plan. The main concept is a psychiatric plan-of-care record. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This is a direct match to SCTID 736254008. It is more precise than a generic care plan parent and avoids siblings like mental health care plans or psychotherapy care plans. No additional clinical attributes are present."
426423008,Oenothera biennis preparation (product),Patient-reported item: evening primrose preparation,"The text captures that the patient reported an evening primrose preparation, but the core coded concept remains the product, with no dose, route, or formulation specified. The SNOMED CT category is Product, matched by SCTID 426423008. The context of patient reporting does not change to a procedure or history concept; it still represents the product. Broader parents omit the species, while children like oil/extract are not implied."
1365801000,Photographic intraoral direct image of frontal view with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),Imaging note: intraoral direct frontal photograph with teeth in centric relation.,"The text denotes a photographic artifact recorded in an imaging note, captured intraorally, with frontal view, directly, and with teeth in centric relation. This matches the Record artifact concept SCTID 1365801000. It excludes lateral/occlusal views and indirect imaging, and it does not add diagnostic or severity attributes, making more general or alternative-view concepts inappropriate."
710413000,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Clostridium tetani toxin (substance),IgG antitoxin to tetanus toxin,"The term identifies an IgG antitoxin directed at tetanus toxin, i.e., the IgG antibody to C. tetani toxin. It represents a Substance and matches SCTID 710413000. No attributes of testing, positivity, source species, or product use are introduced, preventing misclassification. Parent concepts lacking isotype detail and siblings for other isotypes or toxoid targets are less accurate than the specified IgG-toxin pairing."
223681007,Sweden (geographic location),Kingdom of Sweden,"This uses the formal name of the country, which remains the same geographic entity. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). ‘Kingdom of Sweden’ is a clinically safe synonym for Sweden and maps directly to Sweden (geographic location) SCTID 223681007. It does not introduce extra attributes such as time, cause, or association; it simply names the country. Parent concepts like ‘Country’ are too general, while siblings (e.g., Finland) or children (e.g., specific cities) are not expressed."
411738005,Oryctolagus species diagnostic allergen extract (product),Order: Oryctolagus spp. diagnostic allergen extract,"Ordering context preserves the product’s identity as a diagnostic allergen extract from Oryctolagus spp., with no added details like route, concentration, or test type. This is a Product concept, best represented by SNOMED CT code 411738005. Parent terms lacking species or diagnostic purpose are too general, siblings for other genera are inaccurate, and child concepts adding specific source material or test modality would over-specify. The synonym with “spp.” maintains clinical equivalence to the genus-level product."
711248000,Antigen of Helminthosporium halodes protein (substance),Helminthosporium halodes protein Ag,"Using “Ag” as a standard abbreviation for antigen is common in reports and retains the full specificity: antigen of the Helminthosporium halodes protein. The category is Substance. This exactly aligns with SCTID 711248000, avoiding broader mappings to Helminthosporium antigens that do not specify protein or to allergens. Sibling concepts such as the protein alone misrepresent the substance type. The abbreviation does not add attributes or change meaning; it is semantically equivalent to “antigen of Helminthosporium halodes protein.”"
1260497001,Genus Levilactobacillus (organism),Reference lab report — Genus: Levilactobacillus,"This phrasing indicates that a reference laboratory has reported the organism at genus level as Levilactobacillus, with no added attributes such as species, site, or infection. It fits the Organism category and matches Genus Levilactobacillus (organism), SCTID 1260497001. Parent taxa or sibling genera are not mentioned, and child species are not specified, making the genus concept the most accurate. The reporting context does not require a different code type such as a finding; the organism name is the intended coded element."
830058008,Nonsurgical fixation - action (qualifier value),History section item: nonsurgical fixation,"Placed in a history section, the text still denotes the action type nonsurgical fixation and does not add temporal qualifiers beyond context, keeping it as a qualifier value. SCTID 830058008 is the precise mapping. The broader parent 'fixation - action' would be less specific, and the sibling 'surgical fixation - action' contradicts the wording. No mention of site, device, severity, or timing beyond general context is present, preserving specificity to the action."
215619002,"Submersion or drowning due to being washed overboard, docker or stevedore injured (event)",Injured longshoreman swept overboard leading to drowning/submersion.,"The entry states an injured longshoreman (equivalent to stevedore/docker) who was swept/washed overboard and experienced drowning/submersion, which matches the exact event encoded by 215619002. The SNOMED CT category is Event, representing an external cause incident. Using “swept overboard” is a common synonym for “washed overboard” and does not change attributes. Concepts focused on generic drowning or different worker roles would be less precise than this occupation-specific event."
787930001,Direct thrombin inhibitor prophylaxis indicated (situation),Plan acknowledges indication for direct thrombin inhibitor prophylaxis.,"The entry reflects care planning acknowledging the indication for prophylaxis with a direct thrombin inhibitor, without asserting initiation or outcomes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This maps to SCTID 787930001 by explicitly pairing prophylaxis with the DTI class and the concept of indication. A broader concept for anticoagulant prophylaxis would be less specific, and a child concept naming a specific drug is not expressed."
256495005,Dental porcelain repair material (substance),Porcelain repair material (dental),"This entry states “porcelain repair material” and constrains it to the dental domain via “(dental),” which is semantically equivalent to “Dental porcelain repair material” and maps to SNOMED CT 256495005. The concept is a Substance used specifically for repairing dental porcelain restorations. It is more specific than a parent like “Dental material (substance)” and does not drift into related but different siblings such as generic porcelain material for fabrication or procedural repair actions. The phrasing does not add attributes like severity or timing; adding “(dental)” clarifies context without changing code selection, ensuring unique codability to the repair material substance."
399206007,Law projection (qualifier value),Radiology note indicates Law projection,"The entry says the radiology note indicates the Law projection, naming the projection explicitly. The main concept is the Law projection used as an imaging qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 399206007 is the correct and precise code for this named projection. A parent concept for projection in general would be too broad, while alternative named views are siblings and not applicable. No extra attributes (e.g., anatomy or procedural variations) are present, ensuring an exact qualifier match."
702814002,Allergy clinic (environment),Allergy clinic site,"This entry reflects the site as an allergy clinic, keeping the focus on the care environment. It does not introduce timing, encounter type, or demographic qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment (Environment or geographical location). Allergy clinic (environment), SCTID 702814002, is the correct, specific code. Parent concepts like Clinic (environment) are too general, while sibling clinics and child qualifiers (e.g., pediatric allergy clinic) are not indicated. The phrasing remains uniquely mapped to the allergy clinic environment."
126152000,Metipranolol hydrochloride (substance),Ingredient listed: metipranolol hydrochloride,"This entry identifies a named ingredient and specifies the hydrochloride salt of metipranolol without adding details like dose, route, or formulation. The main concept is the substance itself. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Substance, with SCTID 126152000 as the precise match. Using the base compound concept or a product concept would be less accurate because the entry does not describe a product presentation or omit the salt designation."
397359002,Product containing fusion inhibitor (product),Pharmacy catalog entry: fusion inhibitor product,"This entry denotes a catalog listing for a fusion inhibitor-containing medicinal product; catalog context does not introduce clinical attributes such as dose or route. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It matches 397359002, which represents class-based products containing fusion inhibitor(s). Parents like general medicinal products are too broad, and children would specify particular ingredients or forms. Sibling concepts refer to other drug classes or to substances rather than products. The wording is an acceptable synonym for the concept and preserves precise code selection."
224044001,Colorado (geographic location),Colorado—USA,"This entry names the state and its country context succinctly, still pointing solely to the geographic location Colorado. Main concept: Colorado (U.S. state). SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The exact match is Colorado (geographic location) [224044001]. The added “USA” tag is clarifying, not changing the concept. Parent (United States of America) is broader; child/sibling locations (e.g., Colorado Springs or Wyoming) are not specified or implied."
277974003,Qualitative temperature categories (qualifier value),Qualitative temperature grouping,"This describes grouping temperature into qualitative categories, without indicating which group applies. It is a qualifier value construct. The exact SNOMED CT match is Qualitative temperature categories (qualifier value) [277974003]. Child concepts specifying particular group labels do not fit, and observable/finding concepts are inappropriate because the entry addresses category grouping rather than an observed value or clinical conclusion."
702931005,Oncology clinic (environment),Practice setting: oncology clinic,"This entry specifies the practice setting as an oncology clinic. Main concept: oncology clinic environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment (environment). The wording does not imply a generic clinic (parent) or a department/service (sibling) and does not narrow to a subspecialty clinic (child). It remains an environment concept, so Oncology clinic (environment) is the most precise match."
736370007,Day case surgery care plan (record artifact),Day surgery plan of care,"“Day surgery” is synonymous with day case surgery, and “plan of care” is a standard synonym for “care plan,” making this entry equivalent to Day case surgery care plan (record artifact) [736370007]. Main concept: a documented care plan for a same-day surgical episode. Category: Record artifact. This entry is more specific than general care plan artifacts and avoids mapping to a surgical pathway or admission planning concept. It introduces no additional attributes beyond the day-case context."
411796007,Zea mays pollen diagnostic allergen extract (product),Zea mays pollen diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry explicitly names the product as a diagnostic allergen extract derived from Zea mays pollen, which matches SNOMED CT concept 411796007. The main medical concept is a biologic product used for allergy diagnosis; no dose, route, timing, results, or therapeutic intent are added. SNOMED CT category: Product. This is the most precise match because it specifies the allergen source (Zea mays pollen) and the diagnostic extract form, whereas a parent like a generic diagnostic allergen extract lacks the specific source, and siblings refer to different pollens or therapeutic immunotherapy extracts. No synonym is used beyond the exact term, so code selection remains unchanged."
1184592007,Communication problem document section (record artifact),Communication challenges section in the record,"The entry describes a section within the clinical record labeled ""Communication challenges,"" clearly functioning as a document section artifact. There are no clinical attributes beyond the section title. The precise SNOMED CT match is Communication problem document section (record artifact) [1184592007], and ""challenges"" is a semantically equivalent synonym for ""problem"" in a section context. Parent concepts like Document section are too broad, and clinical finding concepts would misinterpret the structural nature of the entry."
890131001,Contact with fish (event),Patient reports contact with fish,"This documentation phrase records that the patient states they had contact with fish, without specifying time, cause, or outcomes. The main concept is contact with fish; the 'reports' wording is merely documentation context. The best match is Contact with fish (event), SCTID 890131001 in the Event hierarchy. It is more specific than parent concepts like Contact with animal (event) and does not introduce other conditions to suggest a child concept. The phrasing is equivalent to contact/exposure, not a clinical finding of disease."
472873000,Swab from urethral meatus (specimen),Collected swab from the urethral meatus,"This collection note describes a swab obtained from the urethral meatus, clearly defining the specimen type and site. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps directly to SNOMED CT 472873000. More general parent terms do not specify the meatal location, and siblings implying a deeper urethral site or a sex-specific meatus would not match the wording. The sentence includes no additional clinical attributes such as indication or laterality, keeping the concept focused on the specimen from the exact stated site."
16615001,Anotopterus pharao (organism),Specimen label: Anotopterus pharao,"This indicates that the specimen is labeled with the species name Anotopterus pharao, without reporting detection or clinical findings. The concept is a species-level organism. The correct SNOMED CT match is the Organism concept SCTID 16615001. The labeling context does not introduce attributes that would shift to a finding or exposure code; it remains the exact species designation."
90757003,Patricide (event),Father killed by his child,"This statement defines the event by roles (victim = father, perpetrator = child), which is identical to the patricide concept. No additional qualifiers are present. Category: Event. More general concepts (e.g., Homicide) omit the specific familial relationship, and other familial-homicide types (e.g., Matricide) do not fit the wording. Therefore, Patricide (event) 90757003 is the most precise code."
373529000,Morphine (substance),"Morphine — name only, no formulation","This entry presents morphine by name only and explicitly denies any formulation details, avoiding dose, route, or salt specification. The main concept is the morphine substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps to Morphine (substance) because it names the compound without formulation attributes. Parent opioid class concepts are broader, while child salts (e.g., Morphine sulfate) are more specific than stated. Product or administration concepts are not suitable since no use or product details are provided."
1306628009,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Extraoral facial photograph of right half of face with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion.,"This wording includes all required attributes: the modality (photograph), the setting (extraoral), the region (right half of the face), the expression (full smile), and the occlusal state (teeth in centric occlusion). It therefore maps most precisely to the Record artifact SNOMED CT concept 1306628009. Broader parent artifacts or sibling variants (e.g., left side or frontal face) would be less accurate. “Facial photograph” and “extraoral” are standard synonyms that preserve the intended meaning."
223626000,Papua New Guinea (geographic location),Location: Papua New Guinea,"This documentation phrasing presents Papua New Guinea purely as a location, which corresponds to the Geographic location category in SNOMED CT. The exact concept is SCTID 223626000. The entry does not introduce attributes such as time or severity, nor does it specify a subregion that would necessitate a child concept. It is more specific than any regional parent and matches the national-level place."
4751000146109,Genus Schizosaccharomyces (organism),Reference organism genus: Schizosaccharomyces,"The entry refers to Schizosaccharomyces as the organism at the genus level, serving as a reference classification rather than a clinical finding. This sits in the Organism category; Genus Schizosaccharomyces (organism), SCTID 4751000146109, is the precise match. More general parents or species-level children are not indicated. The 'reference' wording is contextual and does not change the underlying concept being the genus."
414533004,Intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis given in hospital (situation),Hospital-based IM injection of vitamin K for prophylaxis.,"The statement confirms an intramuscular injection of vitamin K for prophylaxis occurring in a hospital context, with completed action implied. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. Code 414533004 is the best fit as it encodes IM vitamin K prophylaxis given in hospital. Parent concepts omitting route or setting are not specific enough, and siblings covering oral route or non-hospital administration would be mismatched. “Hospital-based” is equivalent to in-hospital and does not add extraneous detail."
278656008,Dental occlusion finding (finding),Narrative: a finding of dental occlusion is documented,"This entry indicates that a finding regarding dental occlusion has been documented in narrative form, without specifying any subtype or abnormality. The main concept is a clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. Coding to 278656008 is appropriate because it denotes a generic occlusion finding rather than a specific occlusal disorder or an examination procedure. The narrative context does not change the underlying concept being represented."
419955002,Residential institution (environment),Patient reports environment is a residential institution,"This is a patient-reported statement identifying the environment as a residential institution, still describing the location rather than a social finding. In SNOMED CT it belongs to Environment or geographical location and corresponds to SCTID 419955002. It does not imply residence status or specify a type of institution, thereby avoiding misclassification to findings or to narrower environment children like Nursing home (environment)."
223512002,Libya (geographic location),Libya — sovereign state name,"Identifying Libya as a sovereign state name is a synonymic way to express the country concept and does not introduce extra attributes. It belongs to Environment or geographical location and maps to Libya (geographic location), SCTID 223512002. Parent classes like Country are generic; children such as subnational divisions are not mentioned. The descriptor remains equivalent and uniquely anchors the code to Libya."
251709008,Corneal measure (observable entity),Corneal measurement descriptor,"A descriptor for corneal measurement indicates the generic observable parameter for the cornea, not a particular property or value. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, aligning with Corneal measure (observable entity) SCTID 251709008. Child concepts (e.g., thickness, curvature) are too specific, and any procedure interpretation is avoided as no action is described."
463304008,Polyether dental impression material (physical object),Stock item—polyether dental impression material,"Inventory context still points to the same physical object: polyether dental impression material. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Despite the context of stock, the coded concept is the material itself, not an action or supply request. The 'polyether' specification ensures it is not coded to the parent generic material or a different sibling, so SCTID 463304008 fits exactly."
305066005,Structure of articular cartilage of patellar surface of femur (body structure),Femoral trochlear groove articular cartilage,"The femoral trochlear groove is synonymous with the patellar surface of the femur; specifying articular cartilage here designates the same body structure without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 305066005 exactly matches because it is the articular cartilage of the femur’s patellar surface. A parent like 'femoral articular cartilage' would be too broad, and siblings such as 'patellar cartilage' would be incorrect. The 'trochlear groove' term is a clinically equivalent synonym for the patellar surface."
246707000,Convergence on approaching object (observable entity),Binocular convergence on approaching object,"Convergence is inherently binocular; stating 'binocular' restates its nature without introducing a new attribute. Category: Observable entity. The essential condition remains convergence in response to an approaching object, which maps to 246707000. This is more specific than general eye convergence and distinct from siblings involving accommodation or pupillary changes. Interpretation and laterality are not included."
28017001,Daytime (qualifier value),Follow-up timing: daytime,"Within a follow-up or scheduling context, 'daytime' is specified as the timing qualifier value. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. This matches SCTID 28017001 and does not add clinical attributes or imply narrower segments. Parent concepts are too broad and siblings are too specific, making 'Daytime' the most precise code."
87199005,Lead screening (procedure),Lab report: lead screening performed,"This is documentation-context phrasing that a lead screening was performed, aligning with Lead screening (procedure), SCTID 87199005. The main concept remains the screening procedure, hence Procedure category; the 'lab report' context does not change the coded procedure. No specimen or results are introduced, so child measurement concepts are not a better fit. It is more specific than general screening and not a sibling like heavy metal screening."
210005,"Arrow, device (physical object)",Item recorded: arrow,"This entry records the item as an arrow, indicating a specific physical device consistent with SNOMED CT 210005. Category: Physical object (Device). The documentation context does not alter the object’s identity or add attributes. It excludes broader parents and avoids siblings such as 'Dart,' ensuring the most precise mapping to the arrow device."
73770003,Hospital-based outpatient emergency care center (environment),Hospital-based outpatient emergency care center,"The main concept expressed is the care environment: a hospital-based outpatient emergency care center. This is an Environment or geographical location concept in SNOMED CT, matching SCTID 73770003. The wording includes all defining elements—hospital-based, outpatient, emergency, care center—without adding other attributes. Using this code is more precise than a parent like a generic emergency care center (environment) and avoids siblings such as free-standing emergency centers or hospital emergency departments, which differ in organizational setting. No clinical condition or event is implied, only the care location."
223674000,Northern Ireland (geographic location),Follow-up entry: Northern Ireland,"In a follow-up context, only the place name Northern Ireland is provided; the contextual label is document metadata and does not assert residence, travel, or other findings. The best SNOMED CT match is 223674000 | Northern Ireland (geographical location) |. The entry does not point to broader or narrower locations, so parent and child/sibling concepts are less appropriate. The wording remains an equivalent representation of the geographic location."
1162386007,Number of self reported binge eating episodes per week (observable entity),Weekly binge eating episode count (self-report),"The entry specifies a weekly episode count and indicates self-report as the source, matching the Observable entity category. SCTID 1162386007 is the correct code because it encodes exactly the self-reported number per week. Parent/sibling concepts like general binge eating frequency not restricted to week or clinician-observed counts would be less accurate. “Count” and “number” are equivalent terms, and adding “self-report” maintains the required attribute."
277544004,Percutaneous embolization of varicocele (procedure),Percutaneous transvenous varicocele embolization,"“Transvenous” clarifies venous endovascular route, consistent with percutaneous embolization, with varicocele as the target, forming a procedure concept. The most accurate SNOMED CT code is Percutaneous embolization of varicocele (procedure) [277544004]. This excludes parent generic embolization and sibling surgical approaches. The addition of “transvenous” is a technique synonym and does not change the code."
183472000,Diabetic emergency hospital admission (procedure),ER-to-inpatient emergency admission for diabetes,"The text shows an emergency admission from the ER to an inpatient unit with diabetes as the reason, identifying a hospital admission procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps to SCTID 183472000, representing diabetic emergency hospital admission. Parent concepts that capture ER transfer or general inpatient admission without the diabetic qualifier are too broad, and child concepts naming specific diabetic emergencies would be too narrow. The pathway detail (ER-to-inpatient) does not alter the core concept."
285325000,Alpha radiation (physical force),Alpha ray radiation,"This entry reiterates the concept of radiation composed of alpha rays/particles, which is alpha radiation. It fits the Physical force category. The best code is Alpha radiation (physical force) SCTID 285325000 since the text specifies the alpha subtype. More general parent concepts would lose specificity, and siblings (beta/gamma radiation) would be incorrect. The phrasing stays within the radiation phenomenon and does not add attributes such as dose, duration, or exposure context."
1217609001,Valaciclovir hydrochloride dihydrate (substance),Generic substance name: valaciclovir hydrochloride dihydrate,"This entry provides the generic substance name “valaciclovir hydrochloride dihydrate,” precisely identifying the salt and hydrate. Category: Substance. It should be coded to the SNOMED substance concept rather than broader parent concepts (valaciclovir base) or sibling salt/hydrate variants, as dihydrate is clearly stated. No additional product attributes are present."
698551008,History of construction of external stoma of urinary system (situation),Follow-up note: has history of constructed external urinary stoma.,"This follow-up documentation indicates the patient’s past surgical construction of an external urinary stoma, clearly situating the information as historical. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It fits 698551008 since it refers to the history of the exact procedure without specifying a subtype or cause. A parent concept like general history of surgery is insufficiently specific, and child concepts for particular diversion techniques are not mentioned. The entry avoids current-status findings, focusing solely on the history."
122588000,Platelet poor plasma specimen from patient (specimen),Platelet poor plasma specimen from patient,"The entry explicitly names the specimen type as platelet poor plasma and states the source is a patient, which matches the SNOMED CT concept 'Platelet poor plasma specimen from patient' (SCTID 122588000). The category is Specimen. This is the most precise code because it captures both the plasma quality attribute (platelet poor) and the subject source (patient). A parent concept like 'Platelet poor plasma specimen' without the patient source would be less specific, and siblings such as 'Platelet rich plasma specimen' would be incorrect. No additional attributes (e.g., anticoagulant, timing, volume) are introduced."
717004007,Structure of anterior section of prostate (body structure),Anterior prostate section,"This succinctly identifies the anterior section of the prostate. The main concept is an anatomical structure. SNOMED CT 717004007 is the exact match. A general 'prostate structure' code would omit anterior specificity, and an alternate region (e.g., posterior) would be a sibling concept and thus incorrect given the wording."
879789003,Attachment peg for knee femur prosthesis (physical object),Device registry entry: knee prosthesis femoral attachment peg,"The registry-style entry names the femoral attachment peg of a knee prosthesis. The main concept is the physical object component. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This aligns with SCTID 879789003, not with broader categories like 'knee prosthesis' or other pegs unrelated to the femoral knee device. The context is administrative and does not alter the meaning."
768748005,Product containing pregnane (product),Pregnane medication,"This entry denotes a medication whose active ingredient is pregnane and does not introduce any other attributes. In SNOMED CT, it belongs to the Product category and corresponds to Product containing pregnane (product) [768748005]. It is not the substance-only concept, nor does it imply a specific derivative (e.g., progesterone) or a specific formulation, which would be child concepts. The word 'medication' is a standard synonym for medicinal product and remains clinically equivalent."
121065007,Vimentin antigen (substance),Patient notes the term “vimentin antigen”,"A patient statement mentioning ‘vimentin antigen’ still denotes the substance and does not imply a result or diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 121065007 is the correct match because the wording identifies the antigen form of vimentin and avoids referencing antibodies, positivity, or testing procedures. Parent concepts like generic Antigen (substance) would be insufficiently specific, and siblings such as anti‑vimentin antibody or vimentin positivity finding are not implied. The quotation context does not add attributes."
406203001,Endurance (observable entity),Endurance domain,"Endurance domain indicates the property area being considered and remains a reference to the observable, not a test or result. This matches 406203001 Endurance (observable entity) within the Observable entity hierarchy. No severity, causation, system specificity, or procedural action is implied, so parent, child, or sibling concepts are less appropriate. Specifically, exercise tolerance and muscular endurance are not mentioned, preventing misalignment with those different or narrower observables."
59263007,Encelia (organism),Encelia spp.,"This entry uses the conventional taxonomic abbreviation 'spp.' to indicate multiple unspecified species within the genus Encelia, which still encodes the genus-level concept rather than any particular species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 59263007 is the most precise match. Species-level children (e.g., Encelia farinosa) are not appropriate because no specific species is named. Parents like broader plant groupings are too general, so the genus concept is correct."
773449002,Old age psychiatry care plan (record artifact),Patient reports having an old age psychiatry care plan,"This is a patient-reported context but still denotes the existence of an old age psychiatry care plan artifact, without adding details about content, timing, or review. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 773449002 is appropriate because the concept is specifically the care plan in old age psychiatry. Coding to a generic care plan would omit the specialty; mental health care plan would be broader than psychiatry. The reporting context does not alter the artifact’s identity."
16098861000119104,History of uveitis (situation),Ophthalmology follow-up: history of uveitis on record,"This follow-up note indicates that the patient has a recorded past history of uveitis, not a current episode. The main concept is uveitis framed as historical; it does not introduce subtype, laterality, cause, severity, or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. The precise match is History of uveitis (situation), SCTID 16098861000119104. Coding to Uveitis (disorder) would suggest ongoing disease and be less appropriate. Parent concepts like generalized history entries lack specificity, while child/sibling concepts specifying anterior/posterior types are too narrow and unsupported. The phrase “on record” denotes documentation context and is equivalent to ""documented history,"" maintaining the same code selection."
840318003,Assessment using Modified Rankin Scale (procedure),Administered the Modified Rankin Scale,"This statement describes the act of administering the mRS tool, which is the procedure of interest. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 840318003 represents administration/assessment using the Modified Rankin Scale. Parent concepts that involve generic assessments or scales are not as precise. Sibling assessments (e.g., NIHSS) use different instruments. No score or severity is provided, so observable entity 'mRS score' is not applicable."
127923005,Structure of right tracheobronchial lymph node (body structure),Chart entry: right tracheobronchial lymph node,"The documentation entry names the right tracheobronchial lymph node as the anatomical structure of note. Attributes include node type, tracheobronchial location, and right laterality. Category: Body structure. This aligns with Structure of right tracheobronchial lymph node (SCTID 127923005). Using a laterality-unspecified parent would be less exact, and choosing a different nodal region would miscode the site. The phrase 'Chart entry' is contextual and does not alter the anatomical meaning, keeping the structure code appropriate."
161947006,Nocturnal cough and wheeze (finding),Nocturnal coughing plus wheezing.,"The entry lists the two symptoms together and specifies nocturnal timing, without additional attributes. As a Clinical finding, it maps exactly to SNOMED CT 161947006. Coding to cough-only or wheeze-only concepts, or to combined symptoms without the nocturnal qualifier, would be less accurate. The “plus” phrasing is a stylistic synonym that retains the same concept."
79440004,Product containing corticosteroid and/or corticosteroid derivative (product),Medication reconciliation identifies a corticosteroid and/or corticosteroid derivative product,"This reconciliation note references a product in the corticosteroid and/or corticosteroid derivative class, consistent with the concept definition. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It avoids details on dose form, strength, or indication. Using 'and/or' prevents narrowing to only one subclass. Parent concepts that include non-corticosteroid steroids are overly broad, and child/sibling concepts specifying only derivative or particular routes are overly narrow. SCTID 79440004 is the most precise match."
167867009,Multiple joint synovial fluid (specimen),"Specimen submitted: synovial fluid, multiple joints","This submission-style wording identifies a specimen of synovial fluid with sources from multiple joints, fitting SCTID 167867009. The main concept is specimen identification. Category: Specimen. The multiple-joints qualifier narrows the code to the specific SNOMED concept rather than a generic synovial fluid specimen and avoids single-joint children. The phrasing adds no additional attributes such as timing, laterality, or associated conditions."
419385000,Use - dosing instruction imperative (qualifier value),Utilize (as the dosing instruction imperative),"This entry uses the synonym “Utilize” to indicate the imperative action verb in dosing instructions, explicitly framed in the dosing context and without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 419385000 (“Use - dosing instruction imperative”) is the best match because “utilize” here is a clinically safe paraphrase of “use” and does not imply route or modality. Sibling verbs like “Take,” “Apply,” or “Administer” would be less appropriate because they carry administration-specific implications. The synonym does not alter the intended concept, so the original code remains correct."
224303005,Education currently received (observable entity),Currently receiving education,"This phrasing is a direct paraphrase of the concept, expressing the present receipt of education without type or level. Category: Observable entity. It matches SCTID 224303005 because it conveys the current state of education being received. It does not introduce attributes that would shift coding to children like specific educational stages or to siblings such as ""Education achieved."" It is not a clinical procedure and thus does not map to patient education or teaching codes."
1204478002,Futuna (geographic location),Futuna — locality,"This entry names Futuna and indicates it as a locality, maintaining focus on geographic location without implying an administrative hierarchy or relationship. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Location, specifically the concept Futuna (geographic location) [1204478002]. A generic parent would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts referring to different or more specific entities would not match. “Locality” is used here as a general synonym for place and does not introduce new attributes or alter the code."
257657002,Recreational facility (environment),Environment: recreational facility,"Main concept: an environment described as a recreational facility; this indicates the type of location without additional qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Environment (Environment or geographical location). The correct and most specific mapping is Recreational facility (environment), SCTID 257657002. Parent concepts like Facility (environment) are vague, and more specific children (e.g., Sports facility) are not warranted by this general label."
271935000,Biopsy interpretation (observable entity),Interpretation of biopsy,"This phrasing is a direct paraphrase of the concept label, referring to the interpretive component tied to a biopsy. The main medical concept is the interpretation, not the biopsy procedure or a diagnosis outcome. As an Observable entity, SCTID 271935000 is the most accurate match. Sibling concepts like a tissue diagnosis (clinical finding) or the biopsy procedure (procedure) would add different semantics; here, only the interpretive observable is indicated."
122665008,Specimen from pancreas obtained by pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection) (specimen),Pancreatic specimen from Whipple resection.,"The entry states a specimen from the pancreas and specifies it was obtained during a Whipple resection, synonymous with pancreaticoduodenectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This precisely matches SCTID 122665008 by including both the organ and the method. It is more specific than general pancreatic specimens and does not suggest other procurement routes like biopsy or distal pancreatectomy, which would be siblings. The synonym “Whipple resection” is clinically equivalent and preserves code selection."
214324004,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision, on highway, between motor vehicle and safety island, passenger of motor vehicle injured (event)",Motor vehicle vs safety island collision on highway with passenger injured,"This concise phrasing captures the event: motor vehicle traffic collision with a safety island, on a highway, and the injured person is the passenger. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The “vs” shorthand is a common clinical synonym indicating collision between two entities and does not change the concept. It maps to SCTID 214324004; broader concepts or different counterparts (barrier, pole) would be inaccurate, and driver-injured variants would be incorrect for this wording."
63177006,Stretch reflex (observable entity),Stretch reflex heading,"A section heading naming 'stretch reflex' signifies the observable entity is the subject, with no attributes (e.g., normal/abnormal) or procedures implied. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity; code SCTID 63177006. Parent 'reflex' is too broad, and specific tendon reflexes or DTRs are not stated. The heading context does not alter the concept, making 'Stretch reflex' the most precise code."
418932006,Oral swab (specimen),Mouth swab sample obtained,"The phrase indicates that the obtained sample is a mouth swab, i.e., a swab specimen from the oral cavity. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to Oral swab (specimen) [418932006], as 'mouth' is synonymous with 'oral' and the object is the specimen. No cheek-specific or throat-specific detail is provided, so more specific child/sibling concepts are inappropriate."
242814005,Exposure of member of public to radiation from diagnostic medical isotopes (event),Patient-reported: I was exposed to radiation from diagnostic medical isotopes as a bystander.,"The concept is an exposure event reported by an individual identifying themselves as a bystander, i.e., a member of the public, with radiation originating from diagnostic medical isotopes. Category: Event. This matches SCTID 242814005; it is neither a patient undergoing imaging nor an occupational exposure, and it specifically involves diagnostic isotopes rather than therapeutic sources. “Bystander” is a synonym for a public member in this context and does not change the coded meaning."
1381844000,Fibrin glue (substance),Fibrin surgical sealant,"This wording denotes the fibrin-based sealant substance and is a recognized synonym for fibrin glue. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The most specific match is Fibrin glue (substance), SCTID 1381844000, because the term identifies the fibrin composition and the sealant nature without describing an application or a branded product. A broader parent such as surgical sealant (substance) lacks the fibrin specificity, and other sealant substances are siblings with distinct materials. No new attributes are introduced."
364049006,Lower respiratory tract observable (observable entity),Lower respiratory tract observation parameter,"This entry denotes a parameter used in observation for the lower respiratory tract, without defining the parameter’s type, method, or results. The key concept is an observable entity associated with the lower respiratory tract. In SNOMED CT, this is an Observable entity and maps precisely to 364049006. It is not a parent concept (not general respiratory) and not a child concept (no specific property like sputum viscosity). It remains within the same semantic scope as the preferred term through a neutral paraphrase."
215190003,Accident due to breakage of part of animal-drawn vehicle (event),Follow-up note referencing accident due to breakage of part of animal-drawn vehicle,"Although documented in a follow-up note, the core concept is an accident caused by breakage of a part of an animal-drawn vehicle. The attributes captured remain accident event, animal-drawn vehicle, and part breakage as the mechanism. In SNOMED CT, this is an Event, best represented by 215190003. An encounter or ‘follow-up’ situation code would not encode the external cause itself; parent accident codes lacking mechanism or sibling mechanisms (collision, overturn) are less precise. The follow-up context is documentation and does not alter the event concept or introduce temporal attributes to be coded differently."
428549008,Secondary ST-T abnormality on electrocardiogram (finding),Assessment: secondary ST-T abnormality on electrocardiogram,"This assessment documents the presence of a secondary ST-T abnormality on ECG, matching the concept exactly. It is a Clinical finding. The explicit secondary ST-T phrasing pinpoints SCTID 428549008 as the most precise code. General ST-T abnormality or abnormal ECG parent concepts would be insufficiently specific, and sibling primary ST-T abnormality would be inappropriate. The entry avoids introducing etiology, severity, or other qualifiers."
370454004,Ginkgo biloba preparation (product),Pre-procedure review lists: ginkgo biloba product,"This entry references a ginkgo biloba-containing product in a pre-procedure review context without adding any detail like dose, route, or formulation. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The precise concept is “Ginkgo biloba preparation (product).” Parents such as nonspecific herbal products are too broad, and child concepts (e.g., standardized extract or dosage form) would be overly specific and are not stated. The context label does not alter the product identification."
394794000,Health clinic managed by voluntary or private agents (environment),NGO-run health clinic,"This statement identifies a health clinic operated by an NGO, i.e., a voluntary/private agent. The concept is within the Environment or geographical location hierarchy and best aligns with SCTID 394794000. No additional attributes beyond management type are implied. The generic parent “Health clinic (environment)” does not specify management, and a sibling such as “Government health clinic (environment)” conflicts with the NGO wording. The synonym “NGO-run” is clinically equivalent to voluntary/private management and leaves the code selection unchanged."
736150009,Declined to perform inhaler technique (situation),Inhaler technique performance refused.,"The passive construction still communicates refusal of performing inhaler technique. No cause or timing attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 736150009 maps exactly to declined performance of inhaler technique. Parent concepts covering general refusal are broader, and siblings like “unable to perform” or “inhaler education refused” would misrepresent the statement. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent variant."
43342005,Capric acid (substance),"Capric acid, a saturated C10 fatty acid","Capric acid is the common name for the saturated 10‑carbon (C10:0) fatty acid decanoic acid. This is a Substance concept in SNOMED CT, and 43342005 Capric acid (substance) is the exact match. The descriptive phrase “a saturated C10 fatty acid” provides classification consistent with the same molecule and does not imply a broader category or different chemical form. Parent concepts like Medium-chain fatty acid are less precise because the entry specifies capric/decanoic acid by name; salts/esters or sibling fatty acids are not indicated."
215972000,"Forced landing while taking off, member of ground crew or airline employee injured (event)","Problem list external cause: forced landing while taking off, airline staff injured.","The problem list item sets the external cause as forced landing during takeoff and identifies the injured party as airline staff, equivalent to airline employee. It aligns with the Event SCTID 215972000. Parent terms are too generic and siblings specifying different victims or different aviation events would miscode. The synonym choices preserve semantics without introducing new attributes."
699232007,"Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure - Sports/Performing Arts Module score (observable entity)",DASH optional module: Sports/Performing Arts score,"The DASH Sports/Performing Arts module is an optional DASH module, and the entry focuses on its score. No numerical value or timing is included. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 699232007 specifically encodes the Sports/Performing Arts Module score within DASH. Referring to it as an “optional module” aligns with how DASH is structured and does not introduce a different concept. Sibling concepts like the Work Module score or total DASH score are excluded by explicitly naming the Sports/Performing Arts module."
463393006,Esophageal stent extractor (physical object),Esophageal stent extraction instrument,"This entry uses 'extraction instrument' to denote the physical object designed for removing esophageal stents, still mapping exactly to 'Esophageal stent extractor' SCTID 463393006. Category: Physical object (device). It is not a procedure or observable; it is the device itself. A parent concept without anatomic specificity is too broad, and children with specific mechanism or design are not specified here, keeping it at the correct level."
1279589000,American Joint Committee on Cancer rcT1a (qualifier value),History note: AJCC rcT1a documented,"As a history note, this entry documents the AJCC rcT1a staging qualifier, meaning recurrent clinical T1a. It maps to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value American Joint Committee on Cancer rcT1a. Parent concepts like rcT category or rcT1 lack the subcategory detail, and siblings such as cT1a or pT1a represent different contexts. The wording remains focused on the qualifier and does not introduce site, extent, or other attributes."
69321000119105,History of simple excision of pterygium (situation),Past surgical history: simple excision of pterygium.,"The wording places the simple excision of pterygium squarely in the past surgical history, which is a situation statement rather than an active procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. This exactly aligns with History of simple excision of pterygium (69321000119105). Choosing a parent concept (e.g., History of excision of pterygium) would remove the specified technique. Selecting a sibling that includes grafts or adjuvant therapies would add attributes not present. The procedure concept alone would be inappropriate because the statement does not indicate a current intervention."
396163008,Milligram/kilogram (qualifier value),Notation: mg/kg,"The entry provides the notation mg/kg, which is directly the unit Milligram/kilogram (SCTID 396163008), a Qualifier value. There is no time dimension or different unit magnitude, so this excludes concepts such as mg/kg/min or mcg/kg. As a notation-only expression of the unit, it cleanly maps to the given qualifier without invoking parent or child concepts."
16215611000119102,Specimen from right lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchial aspiration procedure (specimen),Specimen: bronchial aspirate—right lower lobe of lung,"This is a specimen entry specifying both the method ('bronchial aspirate' from an aspiration) and the site ('right lower lobe of lung'). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen and maps exactly to 'Specimen from right lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchial aspiration procedure.' A broader site-only specimen code would be incomplete, while siblings like BAL, bronchial washing, sputum, or tracheal aspirate are procedure/site mismatches. The dash notation adds no extra attributes and preserves conceptual equivalence."
81611004,Retrospective audit (procedure),Retrospective audit recorded,"The entry conveys that a retrospective audit, the procedure of interest, has been recorded, but the core concept remains the retrospective audit itself. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Retrospective audit (procedure) SCTID 81611004 is the exact match because it specifies an audit done after the events. Parent concepts like Audit (procedure) do not capture the temporal detail, and sibling concepts such as Prospective audit or Internal audit would add incorrect or extraneous qualifiers. 'Recorded' indicates documentation and does not alter code selection."
411786003,Hordeum vulgare pollen diagnostic allergen extract (product),"Diagnostic allergen reagent, barley pollen","This entry uses 'diagnostic allergen reagent' to denote a product intended for diagnostic testing and specifies 'barley pollen,' which corresponds to Hordeum vulgare pollen. It is a Pharmaceutical/biologic product in SNOMED CT. With no method, concentration, or therapy details, it maps best to the Hordeum vulgare pollen diagnostic allergen extract rather than a parent generic reagent or a modality-specific child."
63619003,"Fiberoptic cable, device (physical object)",Optical fiber cable (device),"“Optical fiber cable” is a clinically safe synonym for “fiberoptic cable,” and the device qualifier keeps the focus on the physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). The wording does not specify a specialized subtype or application, so narrower concepts like endoscopic light-guide components or other optical instruments are not implied. Parent-level devices would be too generic, and siblings like electrical cable devices are excluded by the optical fiber descriptor. Thus, SCTID 63619003 is the most accurate match."
223773002,Part of Australasian country (geographic location),Area within an Australasian country,"This entry specifies a generic area inside a country in Australasia, equivalent in meaning to 'part of Australasian country' and correctly maps to SCTID 223773002. Category: Geographic location. It avoids naming any administrative level or specific place, so it does not drift into child concepts. The Australasian bound clarifies the regional scope, ensuring it does not match broader or different regional parents/siblings."
718589007,Gastric pH strip (physical object),Gastric pH paper,"This concise entry denotes the paper-based strip meant for assessing gastric pH, without adding procedural or result details. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 718589007 is the exact match because the gastric context is explicit, distinguishing it from generic pH paper. Alternative device concepts (probes/meters) and observable or procedure concepts are not appropriate since the entry refers strictly to the physical consumable."
466795007,"Bladder brachytherapy system applicator, manual (physical object)",Manual applicator for bladder brachytherapy system,"The device is an applicator used with a bladder brachytherapy system, explicitly manual in operation. The main concept is a manually operated brachytherapy applicator for the bladder, with attributes of site (bladder) and manual operation. It fits the SNOMED CT Physical object (Device) category, and SCTID 466795007 most precisely identifies this item. Parent concepts that are generic to brachytherapy applicators or lack manual specificity would be broader, and sibling/child concepts such as powered applicators or applicators designated for other anatomical sites are excluded by the wording. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term without introducing new details."
78228009,Tellurium-129m (substance),Radionuclide Te-129m,"This entry uses a clinically standard synonym with the element symbol and metastable designation to denote Tellurium-129m. It is a Substance in SNOMED CT and does not imply any clinical procedure or exposure. The 'm' ensures it is the metastable isomer, not the ground-state isotope, so Tellurium-129m (substance) [78228009] is the exact match. Parent or sibling codes would be less specific and inappropriate for this precise nuclide."
767315006,Product manufactured as transdermal dose form (product),Transdermal dose-form product,"The entry names a product defined by its manufactured dose form being transdermal, which matches the SNOMED CT Product category concept “Product manufactured as transdermal dose form.” It does not introduce any ingredient, brand, strength, release characteristics, or specific presentation (e.g., patch subtype), so it is neither a child concept nor a sibling like oral or topical dose forms. It is more specific than a parent concept such as generic manufactured dose form without route. The wording uses a clinically standard synonym (“dose form” vs “dosage form”) that does not alter code selection."
2461000175101,Pulmonary rehabilitation service (qualifier value),Service title: pulmonary rehabilitation,"Using “service title” expresses the formal label of the service and keeps the concept as pulmonary rehabilitation service, matching SCTID 2461000175101 (qualifier value). The main concept is the service classification; there are no added attributes such as timing, severity, setting, or referral. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. More general services would reduce specificity, and procedural concepts would not fit because the entry indicates a service title rather than an action performed."
87337004,Sulfur iodide (substance),Chemical name: sulfur iodide,"Stating the chemical name directly identifies the substance sulfur iodide without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, coded as Sulfur iodide (substance) [87337004]. The wording does not suggest a medicinal product, exposure, allergy, or laboratory measurement. Thus, broader parent concepts or different iodine-sulfur compounds are less appropriate, and the specific substance concept is the most precise match."
444804000,Multidisciplinary care conference report (record artifact),Multidisciplinary patient care conference report,"In this wording, “patient care” clarifies the clinical purpose of the multidisciplinary conference, and “report” identifies the artifact documenting it. This is a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. The best match is 444804000, which explicitly denotes the report of a multidisciplinary care conference. Coding the conference as an event or any other document type (e.g., care plan or progress note) would not align with the stated artifact. The phrase does not add attributes like diagnosis or severity, maintaining unique codability to the specified concept."
115420001,"Antibody band pattern, function (observable entity)",Antibody band pattern function observable,"This entry explicitly identifies the item as an observable and names it “antibody band pattern function,” directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 115420001 (Observable entity). It avoids adding any attributes such as specimen, method, or interpretation. Choosing a general band pattern concept would be too broad, and siblings focused on different properties would misalign. The wording is a clear, equivalent expression of the same observable concept."
307851007,Record type (record artifact),EHR record type,"This indicates the metadata 'type' used within an electronic health record system, still referring to the type classification of a record. The precise SNOMED CT concept is Record type (record artifact) SCTID 307851007. Mentioning EHR is contextual and does not shift the concept to status, format, or a specific subtype. Parent 'Record artifact' would be too general, and siblings such as 'record status' or 'record field' are different constructs."
224065007,Maryland (geographic location),US state: Maryland,"The phrase identifies Maryland specifically as a U.S. state, which is a geographic location and not an organization or clinical finding. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). The most accurate code is Maryland (geographic location), SCTID 224065007. Referencing the type (“US state”) is classificatory context and does not shift the coding to the generic class of U.S. states or to another hierarchy level."
414160002,Exposure to carbon dioxide (event),CO2 exposure noted in chart,"A documentation-oriented phrase confirming an exposure event to carbon dioxide, without adding route, timing, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the most precise code is Exposure to carbon dioxide (event), SCTID 414160002. Parent concepts would be overly general, and sibling concepts involve other gases. No attributes suggesting child concepts (route, occupational setting) are present. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
217358003,Carbon monoxide fumes from conflagration in church (event),Carbon monoxide fumes in the setting of a church blaze,"A 'blaze' here denotes a large fire consistent with a conflagration, and the entry retains the agent (CO fumes) and location (church), describing an exposure event. SNOMED CT categorizes this as an Event. SCTID 217358003 exactly captures CO fumes from a church conflagration. Parent concepts like generic CO exposure or fire-in-church without the CO attribute would be less specific, and disorders such as poisoning are not stated. The synonym 'blaze' is acceptable for conflagration and does not alter code selection."
218078002,Accident caused by explosion of pressure cooker (event),History: accident linked to explosion of pressure cooker,"This historical note records an accident causally linked to a pressure cooker explosion, matching SCTID 218078002 under the Event hierarchy. It avoids additional qualifiers (timing beyond being in history, injury types, or locations). The phrasing stays within the exact concept scope; parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts that only describe an explosion would not include the accident context."
122641005,Specimen from ileum obtained by segmental resection (specimen),Ileal tissue specimen from segmental resection,"This entry indicates a tissue specimen originating from the ileum obtained via segmental resection. Concepts: specimen, site (ileum/ileal), method (segmental resection). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 122641005 is the best match because it encodes the exact source and procurement technique. Parent concepts would be too broad without the method, and sibling techniques (biopsy or polypectomy) would not match the wording. 'Ileal tissue specimen' is a clinically safe synonym for a specimen from the ileum."
726738003,Cytology report (record artifact),Cytology lab report,"The entry indicates a lab-generated report dealing with cytology, explicitly a document artifact rather than a clinical finding or procedure. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and matches Cytology report (record artifact) [726738003]. A generic Lab report would be too broad, and a cytology test or specimen concept would be wrong, as the wording centers on the report. No additional attributes (e.g., site, timing, results content) are introduced, so no child or sibling concept provides a better fit. “Lab report” is a common synonym for laboratory report and remains semantically equivalent."
890135005,Contact with Jacobaea vulgaris (event),Exposure: contact with Jacobaea vulgaris,"This statement denotes an exposure event specifically via contact with the species Jacobaea vulgaris. It does not add attributes like timing, severity, accidental intent, or outcomes, keeping it within the Event domain. The precise species reference matches SCTID 890135005, whereas broader parents like “Exposure to plant” would lack the species specificity. Sibling or child concepts implying allergic reaction, ingestion, or toxic effect are not suggested by the wording. The term “exposure: contact” is a clinically equivalent phrasing for a contact event and does not change code selection."
224049006,Hawaii state (geographic location),Aloha State (Hawaii),"“Aloha State” is the widely recognized nickname for the U.S. state of Hawaii and, with the parenthetical clarification, denotes the same state-level geographic entity. No attributes beyond naming the location are present. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location; the code 224049006 Hawaii state (geographic location) is the precise match. This does not refer to specific islands or cities, thereby excluding child/sibling concepts. The nickname is a safe synonym that does not alter coding."
1268444006,Surgical margin involved by Merkel cell carcinoma in excised skin specimen (observable entity),Pathology: Merkel cell carcinoma extends to the surgical margin in the excised skin.,"This wording indicates that Merkel cell carcinoma extends to (i.e., reaches) the surgical margin in an excised skin specimen, confirming margin involvement. The observation is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT. SCTID 1268444006 is the best match because it is specific to MCC involvement at the margin in skin excision. Broader margin involvement codes lack the tumor type, and negative margin concepts are not supported. ‘Extends to the margin’ is a recognized phrase for positive margin and remains equivalent without adding new attributes."
426410001,Removal of ventricular assist device (procedure),Patient statement: my ventricular assist device was removed,"Even in patient-reported phrasing, ‘my ventricular assist device was removed’ clearly describes the removal procedure. The main concept is the procedure of VAD removal, without additional attributes like side or specific model. This maps to SNOMED CT Procedure 426410001. Parent concepts would be overly broad and child concepts adding laterality would be over-specified. The statement distinguishes removal from related sibling concepts such as deactivation or insertion, making 426410001 the most precise match."
123034006,8 hours (qualifier value),Noted: 8 hours,"The phrase indicates a noted duration of eight hours. The main concept is the Qualifier value '8 hours', with SCTID 123034006 as the precise match. The contextual verb 'Noted' does not add attributes such as frequency or conditionality, so alternate parent or sibling concepts are not more accurate."
79287008,"Tampon, device (physical object)",Equipment designation: tampon (device),"This designates the equipment item as a tampon (device), indicating a Physical object. It corresponds to SCTID 79287008 Tampon, device without specifying site or use. A parent device concept would be overly broad, and any child with anatomical qualifiers would be too specific. The phrasing is a safe synonym that does not introduce new attributes."
427196009,National Cancer Institute histologic grading system (staging scale),NCI histologic grade classification,"The term 'classification' here denotes the formal scale used for histologic grading and names NCI as the authority. No grade, site, or result is provided—only the scale. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s Staging/assessment scale (qualifier value) category. The SCTID 427196009 concept precisely captures the National Cancer Institute histologic grading system. Alternatives such as generic histologic grading classification or sibling scales (e.g., Nottingham) are not suggested by the wording, ensuring this is the most accurate code. 'Classification' is a clinically safe synonym for 'grading system'."
242512004,Burning due to contact with hot surface of solid fuel stove (event),Burn secondary to contact with hot solid fuel stove surface,"The entry attributes a burn to contact with the hot surface of a solid fuel stove, specifying the external cause. This is an Event. SCTID 242512004 best fits because it encodes the burn resulting from contact with a hot solid fuel stove surface. Broader concepts or those involving different heat sources would not be as precise. The phrase “secondary to” is a causal synonym of “due to,” maintaining equivalence without adding attributes."
463611001,Mechanical tachometer (physical object),Mechanical tachometer in equipment inventory,"The entry denotes the presence of a mechanical tachometer in an inventory context, but the object itself is the focus. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). The mechanical qualifier ensures the precise mapping to Mechanical tachometer (physical object), not to generic tachometer or electronic variants. Inventory/location context does not create a different SNOMED concept; no additional attributes of type, severity, timing, or association are introduced."
438405000,High pitched cry (finding),High pitch to the cry,"Main concept: high-pitched cry; attribute: pitch high. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. This concise description purely denotes the cry’s high pitch and is equivalent to SCTID 438405000. It does not introduce cause, age, timing, or severity, so a broader abnormal cry code or sibling codes (e.g., hoarse cry) would be less accurate."
224956002,Lips pink (finding),Chart entry: lips pink.,"This entry documents the Clinical finding that the lips are pink, clearly indicating site and color. It is best coded as Lips pink (finding) [224956002]. Broader parent classes do not specify pink, and sibling concepts identify different colors or abnormalities. The chart context is simply documentation style and does not alter the concept or add attributes."
432061007,Specimen from vein obtained by biopsy (specimen),Histology specimen: vein (biopsy).,"This entry denotes a histology specimen with source vein and method biopsy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It correctly maps to 432061007, matching the exact combination of vein source and biopsy collection. A parent such as “Biopsy specimen” lacks vein specificity, and arterial siblings would be incorrect here. The histology context does not introduce new attributes; it frames the same specimen concept."
1109201000112105,Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Yersinia (organism),Confirmed ESBL-producing Yersinia,"The phrase specifies the organism Yersinia and confirms the ESBL-producing property. This is an Organism concept. The exact match is ESBL-producing Yersinia (SCTID: 1109201000112105). Mapping to parent Yersinia (organism) would ignore the resistance trait, and mapping to species-level ESBL Yersinia would assume detail not present. The term “confirmed” is contextual and does not introduce attributes like site or disease; the content remains the organism with its ESBL phenotype."
1306651009,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Photographic record: extraoral left facial half, full smile, teeth in centric occlusion.","This entry describes the photographic record artifact: an extraoral image of the left facial half with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact (Physical object). The specified modality, laterality, expression, and occlusion align exactly with SCTID 1306651009. Broader parent concepts lack critical qualifiers, and sibling artifacts with right laterality or different expressions would be incorrect for this wording. The phrasing uses clinically equivalent synonyms."
465391006,Transillumination phlebectomy system control unit (physical object),Transillumination phlebectomy system base control unit,"This entry designates the base control unit of the transillumination phlebectomy system, which is a device component and thus a Physical object (Device). The focus remains on the control unit rather than the full system or other components, aligning with SCTID 465391006. More general parent concepts are insufficiently specific, and siblings (light source, handpiece) are not implied. The wording is a safe synonymic variant that maintains the same concept without adding extraneous attributes."
408654003,Specimen obtained by amputation (specimen),Accessioned specimen obtained via amputation,"The specimen is described as accessioned and obtained via amputation, directly indicating 'Specimen obtained by amputation.' The category is Specimen. Operational terms like 'accessioned' do not add clinical attributes that would alter coding to parent or child concepts. It excludes site-specific details and other procedure types, supporting SCTID 408654003."
469782001,Material-handling lift (physical object),Warehouse material-handling lift,"The phrase identifies a material-handling lift located in a warehouse setting; the setting does not change the object’s identity. The main concept is a lift intended for materials. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This matches Material-handling lift (SCTID 469782001) most precisely; parent categories would be too broad, and specific child devices (forklift, dumbwaiter, freight elevator, hoist, personnel lift) are not implied because no subtype or human transport is mentioned."
700456002,Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (event),Reported exposure to diethylstilbestrol,"This entry states that exposure to diethylstilbestrol has been reported, maintaining the core concept of exposure without adding route, timing, or harm. It best fits Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (event), SCTID 700456002, in the Event hierarchy. The reporting context does not introduce a situation with explicit historical context, nor does it indicate adverse outcomes or administration. More general parent concepts are less specific, so the agent-specific event is the correct and most precise code."
9883003,"Cargo handling gear, device (physical object)",Cargo handling gear device,"The main concept explicitly named is a manufactured device used for handling cargo, i.e., cargo handling gear. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). This wording directly matches the preferred term and identifies the object without adding type, function specifics beyond 'handling cargo,' timing, or causality. A broader parent like 'Device (physical object)' would be insufficiently specific, and children such as specific cargo hooks, cranes, or nets are not indicated. Therefore, SCTID 9883003 is the most precise match."
61762001,Plasmodium chabaudi (organism),"Plasmodium chabaudi, species-level","The wording specifies that the reference is at the species level for Plasmodium chabaudi. This aligns with SNOMED CT Organism SCTID 61762001. The entry does not introduce attributes like presence, causation, or testing outcomes, so clinical finding codes are less fitting. It is more precise than a genus-level parent and does not indicate any subspecies or alternative species, supporting the selection of the exact organism concept."
57955009,Hot weather (physical force),Local weather is hot,"The entry states the weather is hot and introduces no clinical attributes; 'local' simply situates the observation context without changing the nature of the weather. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. This fits Hot weather (physical force) [57955009]. Parent concepts like Weather (physical force) would be nonspecific, and siblings like Heat wave or High ambient temperature are not implied. The wording remains a direct expression of hot weather."
773212005,Mechanical break-force limb muscle tester (physical object),Mechanical break-force limb muscle tester utilized in follow-up session,"This phrasing confirms the use of the specific mechanical break-force limb muscle testing device during a follow-up, which does not add or change device attributes. The identity remains a Physical object defined by mechanical modality, break-force method, and limb muscle focus. More general testers would be less specific, and alternative modality devices would be different siblings. The entry is best coded as the mechanical break-force limb muscle tester."
276746005,Environmental event (event),Environmental event documented in chart,"This entry identifies an environmental event and notes documentation context without asserting timing or type. The main concept is an environmental event; category: Event. Environmental event (event) [276746005] is the precise match. Parent Event (event) is too broad; child concepts for specific environmental phenomena (e.g., heat wave) are not mentioned. The documentation phrase is contextual and does not introduce a distinct SNOMED attribute that would change code selection."
426280005,Respired desflurane concentration (observable entity),Concentration in respired air: desflurane,"This phrasing indicates the measured concentration of desflurane in respired air, which is equivalent to respired gas in clinical parlance and is an Observable entity. It best matches SCTID 426280005, as it neither specifies inspired vs expired nor adds dosing or MAC context. Parent concepts would be too general, and child/sibling observables with phase‑specific qualifiers (inspired, expired, end‑tidal) are not indicated."
469017007,Dental x-ray film holder (physical object),Dental x-ray film holder apparatus,"The main concept is the apparatus designed to hold dental x-ray film, which is the dental x-ray film holder. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). The term 'apparatus' does not alter the identity and remains within SCTID 469017007, without expanding to general dental equipment or narrowing to technique-specific variants. Siblings like sensor holders or bite blocks are excluded by the explicit 'film holder' wording."
1193917004,Flap creation - action (qualifier value),Flap created,"The passive phrasing indicates that a flap was created, i.e., the surgical action performed. This corresponds to the qualifier value 'Flap creation - action' [1193917004] used to represent procedural methods. It does not convey procedure type, anatomical site, or flap variant, preserving the general action nature. More specific or different actions (advancement, rotation, incision) are not implied, so this exact action concept is appropriate."
278270002,M alphanumeric strain (qualifier value),Alphanumeric 'M' strain code,"This entry conveys a strain code that is alphanumeric and begins with M, which is exactly the type specified by M alphanumeric strain. The concept is not a clinical finding or disorder but a Qualifier value used in microbiological typing. It maps best to SCTID 278270002 because it asserts the M-prefixed alphanumeric pattern without introducing specifics like M1 or any organism name, thereby avoiding child or sibling concepts."
288909002,Does move food in mouth (finding),Does move food in mouth,"This is essentially the preferred term restated, explicitly affirming the presence of moving food in the mouth. It maps exactly to the Clinical finding 'Does move food in mouth (finding)' (288909002). It does not imply chewing, bolus formation, difficulty level, or timing, avoiding inappropriate mapping to parent or sibling concepts. The wording is precisely congruent with the concept."
217461001,Jump from burning factory (event),Jumped from the burning factory building,"The entry specifies a jump from the factory building while it is burning, preserving the exact setting and action. Category: Event. SCTID 217461001 is most precise, as generic “Jump from burning building” omits factory specificity and “Factory fire” omits the jump. No details such as height or outcomes are added, avoiding child concepts that would require those attributes."
258778006,Millikatal (qualifier value),Please report in millikatal,"This directive specifies millikatal as the unit for reporting, which is the unit of catalytic activity. As a unit designation, it is a Qualifier value and aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 258778006. It avoids introducing measurement magnitudes or derived units (e.g., per liter), so parent or sibling unit concepts would be less precise. The wording is a context of usage but does not alter the underlying unit, maintaining equivalence to Millikatal (qualifier value)."
1365815003,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror of left buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Dental photography: intraoral mirror image of left buccal segment—teeth in centric occlusion.,"The statement identifies a photographic intraoral image viewed via mirror of the left buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion, which is a record artifact. It matches SNOMED CT concept 1365815003 by including all necessary attributes. Broader parent artifacts would lack specificity, and sibling artifacts with alternative laterality, view, or occlusion would be incorrect. 'Dental photography' and 'mirror image' are clinically equivalent phrasing to the preferred term without changing code selection."
224011007,Part of Canada (geographic location),Canadian area (unspecified),"“Canadian area (unspecified)” denotes an unidentified area within Canada, i.e., a part of the country. This belongs to the Geographic location hierarchy and maps best to SCTID 224011007. Coding to Canada as a whole would be too broad, while selecting specific provinces or municipalities would be too narrow. The synonym “area” is acceptable and does not alter code selection."
310002000,Assessment service (qualifier value),Diagnostic report service classification: assessment service,"The classification of service in a diagnostic report as “assessment” remains a qualifier value concept. It maps cleanly to Assessment service (qualifier value) [310002000]. No procedural details, specialty attributes, or subtypes are indicated, avoiding parent/sibling misclassification."
430814002,Family history of neuropathy (situation),Patient-stated family history of neuropathy,"The phrasing makes clear the patient reports a family history of neuropathy, with no further qualifiers. The key concept is family history of neuropathy, a Situation with explicit context. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is 430814002 Family history of neuropathy. Coding to neuropathy (disorder) would incorrectly imply a personal diagnosis, and specifying types like polyneuropathy or diabetic neuropathy would add unsupported detail. The 'patient-stated' qualifier does not alter the concept, only the source."
228751006,Semicircular implant (physical object),Device: semicircular implant,"This line-item style entry identifies the device type as a semicircular implant, which is a Physical object. It aligns with Semicircular implant (SCTID 228751006). The contextual label “Device:” does not imply placement or clinical status; it simply categorizes the object. Mapping to parent implant device would lose the specific geometry, and any child or sibling concepts that differ by shape or site are not supported by the text."
409633002,Smallpox vaccination site (observable entity),Smallpox vaccine administration site,"This phrase specifies the site associated with the administration of the smallpox vaccine and does not add extra attributes or findings. It is an Observable entity that maps directly to SCTID 409633002 |Smallpox vaccination site (observable entity)|. “Administration site” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “vaccination site,” and it preserves the focus on the site rather than the procedure itself. Broader parents like “Vaccination site” lack the vaccine type specificity, and siblings denoting findings (e.g., scars) would not be appropriate. The wording cleanly identifies the specific vaccination site for smallpox."
737433005,Hypoglycemia clinical management plan (record artifact),Low blood sugar management plan,"This entry identifies a management plan for hypoglycemia using the synonym 'low blood sugar,' clearly describing a documented plan artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 737433005 is the correct selection since it specifically encodes a hypoglycemia clinical management plan. Coding to a general management plan would be insufficiently specific, and coding to Hypoglycemia (disorder) would conflate a condition with a record document. The synonym 'low blood sugar' is clinically equivalent to hypoglycemia and does not alter attributes or scope."
223673006,Norway (geographic location),Chart entry: Norway,"This is a simple chart entry naming Norway, with no further qualifiers or attributes. The main concept is the country Norway, categorized in SNOMED CT as a Geographic location. It does not suggest parent regions or child places and introduces no clinical details. Consequently, SCTID 223673006 is the precise selection."
88801000119102,History of malignant neoplasm of tonsil (situation),Documented history of tonsil carcinoma,"This entry states that a history is recorded for carcinoma of the tonsil, which is a malignant neoplasm. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. 'Tonsil carcinoma' is a clinically equivalent term for malignant neoplasm of the tonsil and does not add histologic subtype beyond malignancy. The most accurate code is 88801000119102. Parent concepts like history of malignant neoplasm (site unspecified) or sibling concepts like history of oropharyngeal malignancy would be overly broad, and current disorder codes would conflict with the explicit history context."
429247002,History of malignant neoplasm of bone (situation),Hx of bone cancer,"This phrase conveys a personal history (“Hx”) of cancer arising in bone. It does not introduce subtype, laterality, or current status; it is purely historical context. The appropriate SNOMED category is Situation, and SCTID 429247002 (History of malignant neoplasm of bone) fits exactly. The parent concept of generic malignant neoplasm history would be too broad, and the disorder concept would incorrectly imply active disease. Sibling concepts such as family history or history of secondary malignancy do not apply, and the synonym “bone cancer” is a clinically standard way to refer to malignant neoplasm of bone without adding specificity."
731320005,Entire tributary of splenic vein (body structure),Imaging anatomy: splenic vein tributary,"This entry references the anatomical structure in an imaging context but still solely denotes the tributary of the splenic vein. No pathology, procedure, or specific named vein is implied. It is a Body structure, and Entire tributary of splenic vein (731320005) is the exact concept. Broader parents and specific tributary children would not match the general anatomical wording. The context label ‘Imaging anatomy’ does not change the underlying structure being coded."
297564003,Indonesian language (qualifier value),Provider-patient communication language: Indonesian,"The entry specifies Indonesian as the language for provider-patient communication, aligning exactly with the Qualifier value SNOMED CT 297564003. It does not introduce attributes like modality, translation, or preference; the statement remains focused solely on the language. Broad parent concepts are too general and sibling languages would not match. Thus, the Indonesian language qualifier is the most precise selection."
730738002,Entire bone tissue of distal phalanx of ring finger (body structure),Whole bone tissue of ring finger distal phalanx—anatomical site,This entry indicates an anatomical site and specifies 'whole bone tissue' of the 'ring finger distal phalanx.' It remains a Body structure and exactly matches 'Entire bone tissue of distal phalanx of ring finger' (730738002). The inclusion of 'anatomical site' is contextual and does not change the encoded structure. It avoids broader parents and narrower child concepts by emphasizing completeness of bone tissue at the correct phalanx and digit.
58510007,Structure of shaft of phalanx of third toe (body structure),"Phalanx shaft, third toe","The phrase conveys the shaft portion of a phalanx in the third toe and nothing else, consistent with an anatomy Body structure entry. SCTID 58510007 matches because it denotes the structure of the shaft of the third toe phalanx generically. More general parents (e.g., 'Phalanx of third toe') fail to specify 'shaft,' while children such as 'Shaft of distal phalanx of third toe' would be too specific given the wording. The comma-separated phrasing does not introduce new attributes."
300549004,Unable to have sexual intercourse (finding),Patient reports inability to have sexual intercourse,"This entry documents the patient’s reported inability to have sexual intercourse, conveying the same Clinical finding without additional attributes. It aligns with SNOMED CT 300549004 because it conveys an inability, not difficulty or pain, and no etiology is given. Parent concepts like generic sexual function findings are too broad, and sibling concepts such as dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, or reduced libido introduce different phenomena and would not be correct. The phrase 'reports' adds documentation context, not a clinical qualifier, so the code remains the same."
223921007,County Belfast (geographic location),County Belfast appears in lab requisition,"The lab requisition context simply reports that the location “County Belfast” is present; the coded concept is the geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). No new attributes are added that would redirect coding. A parent concept would be overly broad, and siblings (e.g., city-level Belfast) would misrepresent the stated county. The exact match is SCTID 223921007."
223713009,Argentina (geographic location),Country: Argentina,"This is a field-value statement where the country value is Argentina. It should be coded to Argentina (geographic location), SCTID 223713009, in the Location hierarchy. The entry does not assert residency, travel, or nationality—only the named country entity—so mapping to a parent, child, or sibling concept would be less accurate."
182164003,Entire joint of upper limb (body structure),Entire joint structure of upper limb,"The phrase specifies the whole joint structure in the upper limb and does not introduce any non-anatomical attributes. It belongs to the Body structure category. SCTID 182164003 (Entire joint of upper limb) best fits, as it captures the entire-structure intent. A parent term would be too general, and any child is too specific because no particular joint is identified."
411927003,Prosopis juliflora specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Prosopis juliflora specific allergen extract for diagnosis,"This entry conveys a species-specific allergen extract used for diagnosis and identifies Prosopis juliflora, aligning with a diagnostic product rather than a therapeutic one. The SNOMED CT category is Product, precisely matching “Prosopis juliflora specific diagnostic allergen extract (product)” SCTID 411927003. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term, adding no extra attributes such as concentration, formulation, or patient reaction. It is more specific than the parent diagnostic extract and avoids siblings like therapeutic extracts or other species. The concept remains uniquely and precisely mapped to the designated diagnostic allergen product."
364803003,Finding related to ability to swallow saliva (finding),Ability to manage saliva by swallowing — finding,"The phrase describes a finding concerning ability to manage saliva through swallowing; 'manage saliva by swallowing' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of saliva-swallowing ability. It is a Clinical finding. It precisely matches SCTID 364803003 because it focuses on ability related to saliva swallowing. It does not introduce a determination of status, avoiding child concepts, and is more specific than non-saliva swallowing findings."
735328006,Urological surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Urological surgery inpatient care plan,"The entry explicitly names a care plan for urological surgery in the inpatient setting, identifying the artifact as a documented plan of care rather than a procedure or clinical condition. The main concepts are care plan (record/document), urological surgery (the specialty and surgical domain), and inpatient (hospitalized context). This fits SNOMED CT category Record artifact and precisely matches “Urological surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact)” SCTID 735328006. More general parents like a generic care plan or a non-inpatient urological surgery care plan would omit the inpatient attribute. Children specifying a particular urologic procedure (e.g., nephrectomy) or unit would be too specific. Sibling concepts such as outpatient urologic surgery care plans would be incorrect given the inpatient wording."
34090001,Manual extraction of milk from lactating breast (procedure),Manual expulsion of breast milk from a lactating breast,“Manual expulsion” conveys the hand technique used to express milk from a lactating breast. Main concept: manual extraction/expulsion of breast milk. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It is more precise than a parent concept for expression and excludes siblings involving mechanical pumps or breastfeeding assistance. The term “expulsion” is a valid procedural synonym and does not introduce extra attributes.
710666009,Immunoglobulin M antibody to Legionella pneumophila 9 (substance),Legionella pneumophila serogroup 9-specific IgM,"The entry conveys an IgM antibody specific to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 9, which is the substance concept in question. The main concept is an antibody substance; attributes are immunoglobulin class (IgM) and target serogroup (9). The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It corresponds to SCTID 710666009 and is more specific than parents lacking serogroup detail, and distinct from siblings with other Ig classes. No additional attributes like assay results or timing are present."
734341000,Specimen from mass of posterior mediastinum (specimen),Posterior mediastinum mass specimen,"This entry specifies that a specimen originates from a mass in the posterior mediastinum, using a slightly reordered phrasing. The main concept is a specimen with a clear source. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym of the preferred term and does not imply method or pathology. SCTID 734341000 is the most accurate code. Parent concepts that omit ‘mass’ are too broad, and child/sibling concepts that add biopsy technique or neoplasm status would introduce attributes not stated here."
361234006,Sources isolation (procedure),Provide source isolation,"This directive reflects carrying out the procedure of source isolation for the patient. The concept is a Procedure, and SCTID 361234006 maps precisely to source isolation. No additional attributes are introduced. Choosing a generic Isolation (procedure) would be broader, and sibling procedures (e.g., Protective isolation) describe different purposes. The verb 'provide' is a clinically acceptable synonym indicating execution of the same procedure."
312783009,Entire subcapital section of head of femur (body structure),Entire subcapital femoral head section,"This entry specifies the entire subcapital section pertaining to the femoral head. The main concept is solely an anatomical structure, without any extra attributes. Category: Body structure. Wording maps directly to SCTID 312783009, and the inclusion of 'entire' prevents misclassification to a non-'entire' variant or a broader structure such as the head of femur overall. Sibling concepts like femoral neck or capital region are not mentioned and would be incorrect."
70327001,Structure of all fingers (body structure),Area of interest: all fingers,"The entry provides a documentation context but specifies only the anatomical area, 'all fingers', without side, condition, or substructure detail. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 70327001 is the correct code for the structure of all fingers. Parent concepts lacking the 'all' aggregate are less precise, and child concepts focusing on particular finger parts are too specific. Sibling concepts referring to toes or other hand regions are not indicated. The context label leaves the anatomy unchanged."
81858005,Cloudy (qualifier value),Assessed as cloudy.,"Here, the qualitative assessment is “cloudy,” presented without further attributes. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Qualifier value Cloudy [81858005], an appearance/clarity descriptor. Broad parent descriptors would be less specific, and sibling terms (hazy, turbid, opaque, clear) are not implied. The entry does not establish a clinical finding, supporting use of the qualifier value."
285659007,Acceleration (physical force),Acceleration during movement,"This wording situates acceleration in the context of movement but does not introduce additional attributes such as magnitude, direction, or injury mechanism. The main concept remains acceleration as a physical force. The SNOMED CT category is Event (Physical force), with 285659007 as the appropriate code. Mentioning movement is a contextual detail that does not change the coded concept or imply a different sibling like deceleration; it remains aligned with the acceleration physical force."
434249007,Specimen from ear obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Fine needle aspiration specimen from ear,"The entry conveys a specimen collected by fine needle aspiration and the source site as the ear, which precisely corresponds to SNOMED CT 434249007 (Specimen). Omitting laterality or specific ear subsite keeps it at this concept level. Using “fine needle aspiration” rather than “biopsy” is synonymous in clinical usage for FNAB specimens, and does not alter the coding. Parent concepts lacking either the method or site are less specific, and siblings such as needle (core) biopsy or swab do not match the described method."
119331003,Skeletal muscle specimen (specimen),Skeletal muscle specimen,"The main concept is a specimen consisting of skeletal muscle tissue. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Specimen and matches SCTID 119331003 exactly. The wording names the specimen source unambiguously as skeletal muscle, without introducing collection method, preservation, laterality, or subsite. Broader parents like “Muscle specimen” or “Tissue specimen” are less precise because they do not specify skeletal muscle, and children such as “Biopsy specimen from skeletal muscle” would add a method not present here. No sibling concepts (e.g., cardiac or smooth muscle specimen) fit because the tissue type is clearly skeletal."
64237003,Structure of left half of head (body structure),Target site: left half of head,"This contextual label indicates the anatomical target site is the left half of the head, but the coded concept remains the Body structure itself. It aligns with SCTID 64237003. No additional attributes such as conditions or procedures are introduced. Parent head structures are nonspecific, and siblings or children would misrepresent laterality or scope. The phrasing simply frames the site in planning terminology without changing the anatomical meaning."
116155002,Ampulla of Vater cytologic material (specimen),Cytology sample sourced from Ampulla of Vater,"This phrasing identifies a cytology specimen with the anatomical origin clearly stated as the Ampulla of Vater. Category: Specimen. “Cytology sample” is synonymous with cytologic material, and the site specificity ensures the most precise fit is 116155002. No method, timing, or associated condition is provided, avoiding misclassification to sibling concepts like brush cytology or to parent generic cytology entries."
251921003,Maximum expiratory flow rate at 75 percent of vital capacity (observable entity),MEF at 75% VC,"This denotes Maximum Expiratory Flow (MEF) at 75% of vital capacity, without additional qualifiers. It is an Observable entity since it represents a named spirometry measurement. The SCTID 251921003 is best because the parameter exactly corresponds to the 75% VC maximum flow measurement. Generic MEF without the VC percentage and siblings like MEF25 or MEF50 would be incorrect mappings. MEF is a standard synonym for maximum expiratory flow rate and does not change the concept."
411787007,Lolium perenne diagnostic allergen extract (product),Lolium perenne allergen extract for diagnostic use,"This wording identifies the allergen extract from Lolium perenne and explicitly states diagnostic use, signifying the diagnostic allergen product. SNOMED CT category: Product. It matches SCTID 411787007 precisely. A general allergen extract product without diagnostic qualification would be broader, and any mention of therapeutic use would be a different concept. No procedural method (e.g., skin prick) or other attributes are introduced, keeping the code selection accurate."
285719001,Mechanical abrasion (physical force),Causative force identified as mechanical abrasion,"The text specifies the causative force type as mechanical abrasion, focusing on the force rather than clinical outcome. No severity, site, or timing is added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 285719001 is appropriate because it represents mechanical abrasion specifically; a parent concept like mechanical force is too general, and sibling forces like shear or friction (without abrasion) are less precise. This is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the same mechanism."
309057002,Breast direct smear specimen (specimen),"Breast sample, direct smear on slide","The entry describes a specimen from the breast that has been prepared on a slide as a direct smear. Category: Specimen. This precisely corresponds to 'Breast direct smear specimen'. Broader parents lack the detail of the smear method, and narrower siblings (e.g., FNA smear, nipple discharge smear) would require attributes not present here. The wording maintains the exact source and preparation technique without adding extra qualifiers."
309278008,Female genital tissue specimen (specimen),Follow-up: reviewed female genital tissue specimen results,"This statement indicates results review for a specimen comprised of tissue from female genital structures, without adding subsite or method attributes. It is a Specimen category term mapping to “Female genital tissue specimen (specimen)” SCTID 309278008. Using a broader parent would omit the female genital source, while child concepts tied to specific organs like cervix or uterus would be too detailed for the wording. Sibling concepts involving other specimen materials are excluded by the explicit tissue label. The follow-up context does not alter the specimen identity, supporting code 309278008."
251518007,Turns/amplitude ratio (observable entity),Turns divided by amplitude ratio (EMG),"This phrasing describes the same metric as turns/amplitude ratio by explicitly stating that turns are divided by amplitude, a standard EMG observable. It provides no numeric value, interpretation, or body site, keeping it as an observable entity. The most precise SNOMED CT concept is 251518007 Turns/amplitude ratio (observable entity). Generic ratio observables would be too vague, and reversing the division (amplitude divided by turns) would map to a different concept. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and maintains appropriate code selection."
309187005,Dental tissue specimen (specimen),Container contents: dental tissue specimen,"The entry identifies the contents of a container as a specimen made of dental tissue. Category: Specimen. This precisely aligns with Dental tissue specimen (309187005). The statement does not mention specific dental substructures or other oral anatomy, so child/sibling concepts are not indicated, and parent concepts would be too broad."
425641001,Family Anaerolineaceae (organism),Phylogenetic assignment: Anaerolineaceae family,"The entry communicates a phylogenetic classification outcome at the family rank, naming Anaerolineaceae. It remains an organism taxonomy statement without clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is an Organism concept; Family Anaerolineaceae is the precise match. Parents (higher taxa) or children (lower taxa) would not align with the explicitly stated family rank."
1365826009,Photographic intraoral direct left lateral view image in centric occlusion displaying overjet (record artifact),Intraoral direct left lateral photograph in centric occlusion showing overjet,"This statement identifies a photographic record captured intraorally with a direct left lateral view during centric occlusion and indicates that overjet is shown. It describes an imaging record, not a clinical finding, placing it in the Record artifact category. The wording aligns precisely with SCTID 1365826009. Broader parent artifacts or sibling variants (e.g., right lateral, extraoral, non-CO views, or images displaying other features) would be less specific. The synonym ""showing"" for ""displaying"" and ""photograph"" for ""image"" do not alter the coded concept."
386918005,Docetaxel (substance),Docetaxel drug substance,"The term 'drug substance' here identifies docetaxel as the underlying chemical entity rather than a formulated product, aligning with SNOMED CT’s Substance hierarchy. The precise mapping is Docetaxel (substance) SCTID 386918005. There are no product details or procedural context, so product or administration codes would be incorrect. Class-level or sibling substances are not indicated because the entry specifies the exact compound docetaxel."
411878009,Silk waste specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Silk waste allergen testing extract (diagnostic product),"The entry frames the item as a diagnostic product used in allergen testing, sourced from silk waste, which matches the product concept 411878009. Category: Product. Terms like “testing extract” and “diagnostic product” are synonyms indicating diagnostic allergen extract without adding new attributes such as administration route or test type. A broader parent lacking source specificity would be less accurate, and a sibling referencing silk generally would not match the ‘waste’ detail. No child granularity is implied."
312231003,Heavy particle radiation (physical force),High-mass particle radiation,"‘High-mass’ here is a synonym for ‘heavy’ and indicates radiation due to heavier particles, maintaining the same scope without specifying exact particle types or any clinical context like exposure or dose. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It is more specific than ‘Ionizing radiation’ but not as narrow as naming a single heavy particle, so parent concepts are too broad and child/sibling concepts are too specific. This is a clinically safe paraphrase for SCTID 312231003."
56109004,Intermediate care hospital (environment),Hospital providing intermediate care,"This phrasing describes the facility type by the level of care it provides, which is intermediate care, i.e., an intermediate care hospital. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It fits SCTID 56109004 because it still denotes a hospital environment defined by intermediate care services, without implying acute, rehab, or specialty functions. A broader parent like Hospital (environment) is less appropriate due to the stated care level, and sibling types (e.g., acute or rehab hospitals) are not implied. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and does not introduce extra attributes beyond the environment type."
366518008,Finding of passive range of elbow pronation (finding),Physical exam finding of passive elbow pronation range,"The entry describes a physical examination finding about passive range of pronation at the elbow, preserving the attributes of passive modality, elbow site, and pronation movement. It is appropriately a Clinical finding and maps to SCTID 366518008. Mentioning the exam context does not convert this into a procedure code; the focus remains the finding itself. A broader parent (e.g., passive elbow motion finding) would omit the pronation detail, and a sibling (active pronation range) changes the activation. No extra attributes like normality, laterality, or magnitude are introduced."
257566007,Automatic railway level crossing with gates (environment),Automated rail grade crossing with barriers,"Here, “automated” substitutes for automatic, “rail grade crossing” for railway level crossing, and “barriers” are synonymous with gates (e.g., boom barriers/gates). Category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 257566007 is the best match since it specifies automated operation and gate/barrier presence. A parent crossing concept without automation or barriers would be too broad, and siblings lacking gates would be wrong. The barrier term is clinically equivalent to gates in this context."
247510002,White flecks in nails (finding),Nails show white flecks on exam,"This documents an examination finding: white flecks present on the nails. Category is Clinical finding. The best code is White flecks in nails (finding), SCTID 247510002, because the observed pattern is punctate and nail-limited. Parent leukonychia lacks the punctate detail, and sibling concepts for lines (Mee’s or striata) or diffuse whitening are excluded by the exact wording. No etiology, severity, laterality, or timing is specified."
269791004,Accidental asphyxia in bed (event),Accidental asphyxia while in bed,"The phrase indicates an accidental asphyxial event happening in bed, aligning with the Event semantic tag. SCTID 269791004 is the exact match because it encodes accidental asphyxia in the bed setting. Removing the bed attribute would be overly broad, and adding mechanisms or outcomes would be inappropriate. The wording avoids introducing cause, severity, or timing beyond the bed context."
315613000,Target diastolic blood pressure (observable entity),Intended diastolic blood pressure,"The wording indicates the intended target value for the diastolic component of blood pressure, not a measured reading. Attributes are diastolic and target/intended. This is categorized as an Observable entity since it represents a parameter set as a goal. SCTID 315613000 (Target diastolic blood pressure) is the most precise match. A parent concept like Target blood pressure lacks diastolic specificity, while siblings such as Diastolic blood pressure (as an observable measurement) refer to actual values rather than targets. 'Intended' is clinically equivalent to 'target' within planning contexts and does not shift the coding to another concept."
223599007,Bhutan (geographic location),Origin of sample: Bhutan,"The entry gives Bhutan as the origin of a sample; the location value is Bhutan and is the entity to code. The main concept is the geographic location Bhutan. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, precisely represented by Bhutan (geographic location) SCTID 223599007. The contextual phrase 'origin of sample' does not point to a different concept. No sublocation within Bhutan is specified, and using a broader parent would reduce specificity."
1078411000119105,History of partial replacement of joint of left shoulder with prosthesis (situation),History noted: left shoulder hemiarthroplasty,"The entry records a history of a left shoulder hemiarthroplasty, which is a partial joint replacement using a prosthesis. Attributes include situation (history), laterality (left), and partial replacement. Category: Situation with explicit context. This maps precisely to history of partial replacement of the left shoulder joint with prosthesis. A parent concept of unspecified shoulder joint replacement history is less specific, and siblings such as total replacement history or findings of prosthesis presence would not match the partial procedure history stated."
874872000,Measured quantity of intake of casein in 24 hours (observable entity),Casein ingestion amount in a 24-hour interval,"This entry uses 'ingestion' as a synonym for intake and specifies an amount measured within a 24-hour interval. Main concept: casein intake; attributes: measured quantity and 24-hour interval. Category: Observable entity. It maps exactly to the SCTID, and alternatives without time or referring to other substances would be wrong. 'Ingestion amount' is clinically equivalent to 'intake amount' here and does not introduce route or dosage attributes beyond the intended observable."
304165003,Anterior wrist approach (qualifier value),Surgical approach: anterior wrist,"The phrase specifies a surgical approach to the wrist via the anterior aspect, which corresponds exactly to Anterior wrist approach (SCTID 304165003). It functions purely as a qualifier indicating route and site, with no additional attributes like laterality or procedure type. Category: Qualifier value. More general or different-orientation approaches (parent or sibling concepts) would not fit the explicit anterior wrist orientation. The inclusion of “surgical approach” does not alter the meaning; it remains the same qualifier concept."
290081003,Breast non-tender (situation),HPI: no breast tenderness reported,"The history of present illness documentation negates breast tenderness, meaning the breast is not tender. This is a contextual clinical statement, so the SNOMED CT Situation category is appropriate, and it maps to Breast non-tender (situation), SCTID 290081003. The entry avoids adding laterality, severity, timing, or other conditions. Parent concepts would lack the specificity to the breast, and child concepts specifying laterality do not match the text. Sibling concepts such as Breast tenderness or Breast pain would miscode the absence stated. The wording is a common clinical synonym and supports the same code selection."
76483006,Haemulon melanurum (organism),Scientific name: Haemulon melanurum,"Listing the scientific name explicitly as Haemulon melanurum anchors the concept to a specific species. The main concept is the organism, fitting SNOMED CT’s Organism category with SCTID 76483006. Parent taxa or generic organism categories would be too broad, and no child or sibling taxa are implied. The wording is purely taxonomic and introduces no clinical attributes."
431889006,Specimen from upper limb obtained by biopsy (specimen),Order: upper limb biopsy specimen,"An order entry indicating a specimen to be obtained by biopsy from the upper limb identifies both the anatomical region and the method. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 431889006 is the appropriate code. Parent concepts that generalize site or method are inadequate, and child concepts introducing subsite detail are not supported. Siblings for lower limb or other sampling methods would be incorrect for this wording."
465707002,Transesophageal pacing lead (physical object),Esophageal pacing lead,"In clinical usage, 'esophageal pacing lead' refers to the same device designed for transesophageal cardiac pacing. The phrase identifies the physical object and adds no extra attributes. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. Given established synonymy, 465707002 is the most precise match. It is not an 'esophageal catheter' or a general 'electrode' alone, so sibling or parent concepts are less appropriate."
26121000181100,Pseudonocardia antitumoralis (organism),Pseudonocardia antitumoralis — species,"The dash-separated phrasing emphasizes that “Pseudonocardia antitumoralis” is the species, which is semantically equivalent to naming the organism entity at the species level. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact match is Pseudonocardia antitumoralis (organism), SCTID 26121000181100. No clinical attributes (e.g., detection or infection) are included. Parent or sibling organism concepts are less accurate because the specific species is declared, and no strain details suggest a child concept."
284751008,Launderette (environment),Laundromat,"This entry uses the common American English synonym for a launderette, denoting the same public self-service laundry environment. The main concept is an environmental location only, with no added attributes. Category: Environment. SCTID 284751008 is the most precise match because a laundromat is clinically equivalent to a launderette; it does not imply a different type of facility (e.g., industrial laundry or residential laundry room). Parent or sibling concepts would be less specific or incorrect."
228840004,Radiotherapy beam modifier dimensions (observable entity),Radiotherapy beam modifier dimensions assessed,"The entry indicates assessment of the dimensions of a radiotherapy beam modifier, with the primary concept being the dimensional attribute of the modifier, an Observable entity. Assessed is an action context and does not introduce new clinical attributes beyond dimensions. A general device dimension observable would be too broad, and related siblings like position or material differ from dimensions. The wording does not specify a particular modifier subtype, avoiding child concepts."
252125005,Ocular test distance (observable entity),Ocular test distance documented in report,"Report-style phrasing indicating that the parameter 'ocular test distance' was documented, with no numeric result or specific test subtype mentioned. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 252125005 is the exact match as it represents the ocular test distance parameter. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling or child concepts like specific chart distances or working distance are not implied here."
70609006,Clonicottus recalvus (organism),Taxon name: Clonicottus recalvus,"Here the organism is designated by its taxon name, Clonicottus recalvus, clearly indicating the species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This is an exact match to Clonicottus recalvus (organism), SCTID 70609006, and does not introduce any additional attributes. Parent, child, or sibling taxa would not be as precise."
285064007,Domestic back garden (environment),Home backyard,"This phrasing uses the US-english synonym 'backyard' for 'back garden' and specifies a home (domestic) setting. It represents an Environment concept. It maps precisely to SNOMED CT 285064007 because 'home backyard' captures both domestic residency and the back portion of the property. More general 'backyard' without the domestic qualifier could drift to non-domestic settings, and 'garden' generic parents lack the back placement. No extra attributes are added."
304141001,Hip joint approach (qualifier value),Follow-up documentation: hip joint approach,"This follow-up note records that the approach used was the hip joint, corresponding to 'Hip joint approach (qualifier value)' 304141001. The main concept is the procedural approach attribute; no further attributes are added. Category: Qualifier value. It distinctly identifies the hip joint rather than a general joint or hip region, so parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate. The contextual wording does not alter the semantic equivalence with the qualifier."
387455006,Oxazepam (substance),History note—ingredient documented: oxazepam,"Within a history context, this records oxazepam as an ingredient, still pointing to the chemical substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Oxazepam (substance) SCTID 387455006 is the exact code. No product, dosing, or clinical finding attributes are provided, so mapping to medicinal product or finding concepts would be incorrect. The specificity to oxazepam excludes parent class and sibling substances."
1216953003,Ability to remember to infuse parenteral nutrition (observable entity),Follow-up topic: ability to remember parenteral nutrition infusion,"Presented as a follow-up topic, the entry still expresses the same underlying observable: memory ability to remember PN infusion. There is no value judgment or timing specification, so it remains an Observable entity. General memory topics are overly broad; observables for different treatment tasks are siblings. The content precisely matches the named observable, making SCTID 1216953003 the correct code."
420763003,Pond (environment),Setting: pond,"This indicates the setting is a pond, directly naming the environmental feature. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It best fits Pond (environment) [420763003]. The term 'setting' is contextual and does not change the core entity. More general concepts (Body of water) or different water features (Lake, Stream, Reservoir, Pool) would be inaccurate. There are no added attributes like artificial/natural or use-case (ornamental, retention)."
40019008,Rourea volubilis (organism),Diagnostic report organism name: Rourea volubilis,"The phrase provides the organism name Rourea volubilis in a report context without asserting detection or causality. The main concept is the species-level organism. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism hierarchy, and the exact code is SCTID 40019008. Contextual wording ('report organism name') does not create a finding-based concept, and parent or sibling taxa would not match the precise species name given."
2184005,Positive beta particle (physical force),Identified: positron,"The central term “positron” denotes the positive beta particle, a Physical force in SNOMED CT. The minimal context “Identified” does not introduce exposure, dose, injury, or process attributes. It is specific compared to generic beta particles and distinct from the electron, ensuring SCTID 2184005 is the correct code without drifting to radiation or decay concepts."
21478002,Structure of short bone (body structure),Short bone (body structure),"The entry names the anatomical entity 'short bone' and explicitly labels it as a body structure, which corresponds directly to SNOMED CT 21478002, Structure of short bone. This is in the Body structure category. No additional attributes such as location, laterality, pathology, or timing are introduced. Using 'body structure' is a standard descriptor for anatomical concepts and does not change the meaning. Parent concepts like 'bone structure' are too general, and child concepts such as specific carpal or tarsal bones are more specific than the wording provided, so 21478002 is the most precise match."
1293247006,Entire soft tissue of lower abdomen (body structure),Entire soft-tissue of the lower abdomen,"The entry states the full soft-tissue of the lower abdomen, with hyphenation not altering meaning. It is a Body structure concept with attributes: site (lower abdomen), tissue class (soft tissue), and extent (entire). SCTID 1293247006 fits exactly. A parent concept without completeness is broader than intended, and siblings involving upper abdomen or non-specific abdominal soft tissue are inaccurate. Child concepts introducing specific layers would add detail not present."
309905000,Adult intensive care unit (environment),Encounter site: adult intensive care unit,"This expresses the encounter’s site as the adult ICU, identifying the care environment. Main concept: adult intensive care unit encounter location. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The most accurate code is Adult intensive care unit (environment), SCTID 309905000. Parent concepts without the adult qualifier are overly broad, and pediatric/neonatal/specialty ICU environments are incorrect. The entry avoids admission or timing language, preserving a clean environment mapping."
698427001,History of grafting of corneal patch to eye (situation),Intake history documents corneal patch graft in past.,"The intake note documents a corneal patch graft in the past, clearly establishing the situation context of prior procedure with no added attributes such as laterality or indications. SNOMED CT category: Situation. Code 698427001 is the most precise match because it represents history of corneal patch grafting to the eye. A parent concept like general surgical history would be too broad, and using the procedure code would omit the temporal context. The phrase is a semantically equivalent representation."
313813000,Urine arsenic/creatinine ratio measurement (procedure),Urine As over Cr ratio measurement,The entry explicitly indicates measurement of the As/Cr (arsenic over creatinine) ratio in urine as a laboratory procedure. Main concept: urine arsenic/creatinine ratio measurement; attributes: urine specimen and ratio of arsenic to creatinine. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The abbreviation and mathematical phrasing still clearly denote the same test and do not imply a different parent or sibling concept such as single-analyte testing or the observable result value.
86276007,Bleeding gums (finding),Gingival tissues bleeding,"This entry denotes bleeding of gingival tissues, synonymous with bleeding gums. It is a Clinical finding that matches SNOMED CT 86276007. The terminology focuses on the site (gingiva) without adding severity, frequency, or etiology, making broader or disorder-based codes inappropriate. Specific procedural subtypes (e.g., bleeding on probing) are not implied, so the general finding of bleeding gums is the most precise code."
51911008,Structure of base of phalanx of second toe (body structure),Base of the phalanx in foot digit 2,"“Foot digit 2” is an unambiguous synonym for the second toe, and the phrase identifies the base subpart of its phalanx. As a Body structure, this aligns with SNOMED CT 51911008. A parent concept for the phalanx of digit 2 would be less precise (missing the base), while children specifying distal/middle/proximal phalanx bases would exceed the stated detail. No additional attributes (e.g., laterality, condition) are present; it’s strictly anatomical."
1290627005,Plain X-ray of soft tissue of lower limb (procedure),Plain soft-tissue X-ray of the lower limb obtained,"The phrase indicates that a plain soft-tissue X-ray of the lower limb was obtained, which captures modality, tissue type, and anatomical region. It is a Procedure and corresponds to SCTID 1290627005. No extraneous attributes (laterality, subregion, bone/joint, contrast) are added, making parent concepts too broad and child/sibling concepts less accurate than this exact match."
294452000,Allergy to pyrantel (finding),Pyrantel drug allergy noted,"This entry states a drug allergy and identifies pyrantel as the agent, without adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps to Allergy to pyrantel (finding) SCTID 294452000. General parent categories like Drug allergy are too broad, and sibling concepts tied to adverse reactions or intolerances would miscode the allergy finding present here."
106631000119102,Long-term current use of infliximab (situation),Infliximab maintenance therapy — long-term and ongoing.,"“Maintenance therapy” in this setting denotes sustained, long-term ongoing use; “long-term and ongoing” further clarifies duration and status, with infliximab named. This is a Situation with explicit context of a current medication state rather than a procedural administration. The specific SNOMED concept 106631000119102 is appropriate because it captures long-term current use of infliximab. More general maintenance therapy concepts would be less specific, and other drug-specific siblings would not apply. The synonym does not add attributes like dose or indication, preserving precise mapping."
6476001,Death by electrocution (event),Fatal electrocution,"This entry indicates that the electrocution resulted in death, capturing both the cause (electrocution) and the outcome (fatal). It belongs in the Event category and corresponds directly to 6476001. A more general death code would omit the cause of death, and codes for nonfatal electrocution or electric injury are not suitable because the entry explicitly states a fatal outcome. 'Fatal electrocution' is a safe, equivalent synonym for 'death by electrocution.'"
85728002,Morphologic description only (finding),Morphologic description only,"The entry explicitly states that the content is limited to a morphologic description and nothing else, which directly matches the preferred term. The main concept is a documentation or report that provides only morphology-based descriptive content. There are no added attributes such as timing, severity, or site. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. The most precise code is 85728002 (Morphologic description only), as the phrase is identical in meaning to the concept name. Parent concepts like generic 'Clinical finding' are too broad, and sibling concepts such as 'Morphologic abnormality' would incorrectly imply an abnormality rather than the nature of the documentation. The wording is a direct, clinically equivalent representation of the concept."
242324005,Accidental ingestion of herb christopher berries (event),Mistaken ingestion of herb christopher berries,"This entry describes an ingestion event that occurred by mistake, clearly accidental, and names herb christopher berries as the item ingested. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It fits SCTID 242324005, distinguishing it from parent concepts that lack substance specificity, and from sibling concepts such as accidental exposure without ingestion or toxic effects (disorders). ""Mistaken"" is synonymous with accidental in this context and does not alter the coding choice."
443391000124108,Pediatric clear liquid supplement (product),Clear fluid pediatric supplement,"“Clear fluid” is a clinically acceptable synonym for “clear liquid,” and “pediatric” denotes the intended age group. The main concept is a nutritional product with the attributes of clear liquid formulation and pediatric use. Category: Product. This aligns directly with SCTID 443391000124108. More general or alternative forms (opaque liquid, powder, gel) or adult-targeted products would be inaccurate. The wording avoids introducing dose, route, brand, or nutrient specifics."
314695001,Child height = 50th centile (finding),Child height at 50th percentile.,"The statement explicitly identifies the clinical finding that a child's height equals the 50th percentile. The core concepts are child, height, and a percentile value of 50th, with no added attributes such as age band, sex, timing, or causation. This maps directly to SNOMED CT concept 314695001 (Child height = 50th centile), which is a Clinical finding. Broader parent concepts like generic child height percentile findings lack the specific percentile value, and sibling concepts represent other percentiles (e.g., 5th or 95th) or adult height percentiles, making them less precise. Using 'percentile' is clinically equivalent to 'centile' and does not alter code selection."
1353022006,Union for International Cancer Control rcTis(DCIS) (qualifier value),Imaging impression: UICC rcTis(DCIS),"As an imaging impression context, this text still reports the UICC rcTis(DCIS) qualifier. The main concept remains the recurrent clinical Tis for DCIS; imaging can be part of clinical staging but does not alter the rc designation. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The inclusion of rc and DCIS precisely fits SCTID 1353022006, and it excludes parent/sibling alternatives like rcTis(Paget) or cTis(DCIS)/pTis(DCIS). No additional attributes are specified."
122561005,Blood specimen from patient (specimen),Patient’s own blood specimen,"The phrase highlights that the blood specimen belongs to the patient ('own' clarifies source) without adding specifics on site, fraction, or additives. The concept is a patient-sourced blood specimen. Category: Specimen. Blood specimen from patient (specimen) [122561005] is the precise SNOMED CT match. Using a more generic parent (Blood specimen) would omit the source, while children/siblings introducing venous/arterial or blood components would be too specific. The synonymic phrasing remains clinically equivalent and does not change coding."
217599005,Accident due to heat in kitchen (event),Discharge summary: accident due to heat in kitchen (event),"The entry explicitly designates the concept as an event and preserves the defining attributes—heat cause and kitchen location—matching SCTID 217599005 (Event). It does not introduce outcomes such as burns or scalds, thereby avoiding disorder codes. Broader or alternative event concepts that omit cause or location are less precise."
274231001,Structure of arcuate artery of kidney (body structure),Arteria arcuata renis,"The Latin term directly translates to 'arcuate artery of the kidney,' referencing the same anatomical Body structure without adding attributes. It maps exactly to SCTID 274231001 and avoids broader parent categories like renal artery or artery structure, as well as sibling concepts like interlobar artery. The use of Latin is a conventional synonym in anatomical contexts and does not alter the code selection."
706667002,Examination/treatment light (physical object),Exam light used,"The phrase indicates use of the exam light, but the only discrete clinical object mentioned is the examination/treatment light itself. The main concept is the physical object—exam/treatment light—without added attributes. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The most accurate code is Examination/treatment light (706667002). A parent like generic lighting is nonspecific, and children such as surgical lights would over-specify. The verb “used” supplies narrative context but does not change the object being coded or add device characteristics."
90884009,Loculated (qualifier value),Morphology: loculated,"This entry documents the morphology as “loculated,” which serves as a descriptive qualifier rather than a standalone finding. The main concept is a qualitative attribute indicating loculation. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the exact code is 90884009 Loculated (qualifier value). No mention of the involved structure, pathology, severity, or timing is made, so a clinical finding or disorder concept would be inappropriate. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings (e.g., “multiloculated”) add specificity not present. The term remains a pure descriptor, supporting 90884009."
773438008,Oral surgery care plan (record artifact),Oral surgery care plan created,"The entry states the creation of a care plan specific to oral surgery, which identifies the record artifact. The main concept is the oral surgery care plan itself. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 773438008 is the exact match. A parent care plan would fail to capture the oral surgery specialty, and sibling concepts such as treatment plan or operative plan would represent different types of documents; the term 'care plan' is maintained."
714587003,Product containing pancreatic enzyme (product),Problem list note references a pancreatic enzyme therapeutic product,"Even though placed within a problem list note, the referenced entity is a therapeutic product with pancreatic enzyme. Category: Product. Since no administration details, dosage, route, brand, or specific enzyme subtype are given, the general product containing pancreatic enzyme (714587003) is the most precise match."
102413006,Air pollution (event),Air pollution noted,"Saying the air pollution was noted conveys recognition of the event without adding attributes like cause, severity, timing, location, or exposure. The sole concept is air pollution as an environmental event, which in SNOMED CT is Air pollution (event) [102413006] under the Event hierarchy. Parent Environmental pollution is overly broad, and no subtype is specified, so the chosen code is most precise."
181538003,Entire skin of anterior surface of forearm (body structure),Exam focus: entire skin of the anterior forearm,The entry indicates an exam focus but the coded concept is the anatomical site: the entire skin of the anterior forearm. The main concept is skin plus orientation (anterior) with full extent ('entire'). SNOMED CT category: Body structure (Anatomical structure). This aligns with SCTID 181538003; the contextual term 'exam focus' does not change the anatomical mapping. It avoids broader or different-orientation concepts and introduces no additional attributes.
62867004,External beam radiation therapy with radioactive cesium (procedure),"Radiotherapy—external beam, radioactive cesium source","The entry specifies radiotherapy with external-beam modality and a radioactive cesium source. Category: Procedure. This aligns with SNOMED CT 62867004, which is defined by external beam delivery and cesium material. More general radiotherapy or EBRT without source specificity is less precise, and cesium brachytherapy would be a different technique. The dash/phrase structure does not add attributes."
729662004,Entire muscle acting on metacarpophalangeal joint of finger (body structure),Anatomical structure: muscle acting on metacarpophalangeal joint of finger,"This is an anatomical label specifying a muscle whose function is at the finger MCP joint; the leading context (“Anatomical structure:”) does not alter the target concept. No laterality, digit, or movement type is specified. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 729662004 is the precise match, representing an entire muscle defined by action on the finger MCP joint. Parent anatomy concepts are too general, and children that name specific muscles or actions are overly specific. The wording mirrors the preferred term, ensuring accurate coding."
272166009,Dimethacrylate (substance),Material safety documentation lists dimethacrylate as the named substance.,"This longer documentation context still encodes the chemical substance dimethacrylate and nothing else. The category is Substance. Dimethacrylate (substance) SCTID 272166009 is the proper code. No broader methacrylate grouping or specific dimethacrylate derivative is mentioned, so a parent or child concept would be less precise."
761931002,Medication treatment plan report (record artifact),Patient mentions a medication treatment plan report,"Although framed as a patient-reported statement, the core artifact referenced is a report documenting the medication treatment plan. This is best coded as Medication treatment plan report (record artifact) [761931002] in the Record artifact hierarchy. A parent like Treatment plan report lacks the medication specificity, and siblings such as Medication list or Prescription are different artifacts. The context of “mentions” does not alter the artifact or introduce content attributes; it remains the same report concept."
184241007,Obstetric co-op card (record artifact),Pregnancy co-operation card,"This entry uses a full form of “co-operation” and frames the context as pregnancy, still pointing to the same obstetric co-op card artifact. It maps to SNOMED CT 184241007 (Record artifact). Parent concepts are too generic, and siblings like “Antenatal record” would be overbroad. The synonym does not alter the semantics or add any attributes such as status or timing beyond the inherent obstetric purpose."
177055009,Excision of lesion of broad ligament of uterus (procedure),Surgical excision of lesion of the uterine broad ligament,"This explicitly states a surgical excision of a lesion involving the uterine broad ligament, aligning with SNOMED CT 177055009. Category: Procedure. Adding the adjective “surgical” does not change the concept; excision is inherently a surgical procedure. The entry does not specify approach, laterality, or lesion subtype, so parent concepts are too broad and child/sibling concepts adding those attributes would be over-specific compared to the text given."
112143006,ABO group phenotype (finding),Prenatal record: ABO blood group phenotype,"The prenatal record context does not alter the clinical meaning, which remains the ABO blood group phenotype without specifying A/B/AB/O or adding other attributes. It belongs to the Clinical finding category and corresponds to ABO group phenotype (112143006). Parent concepts are too broad, and children naming specific types are too narrow. No procedural or observable entity is implied, so the finding concept is appropriate."
290106009,No bleeding from surface of nipple (situation),No evidence of bleeding at the nipple surface.,"This wording expresses that examination or assessment found no bleeding at the nipple surface, with no extra attributes. The main concept is absence of nipple surface bleeding, which SNOMED CT classifies as a Situation with explicit context. The most precise code is No bleeding from surface of nipple (situation) [290106009]. Parent concepts like 'no bleeding' lack anatomical specificity, and siblings like 'no nipple discharge' refer to ductal output rather than surface bleeding. 'No evidence of' is a standard phrasing for a negative finding and remains equivalent to the target concept."
116769006,Autologous whole blood product (product),Patient’s own whole blood product,"The phrase 'patient’s own' is a clinically common synonym for autologous, and 'whole blood product' identifies the product domain and composition. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This maps precisely to SCTID 116769006, as it conveys the autologous source and whole blood form. It does not introduce extra attributes such as storage conditions, processing, or timing, and it avoids mapping to procedures or the substance domain, ensuring the product concept is captured."
774100006,Oxygen and/or oxygen compound (substance),Ingredient class: oxygen and/or oxygen compound,"The entry describes a substance class suitable for ingredients, and the core term 'oxygen and/or oxygen compound' denotes either oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds. This falls under the Substance hierarchy, with SCTID 774100006 being the precise match. Limiting to oxygen only or to oxygen compounds only would not reflect the stated inclusion. No product, dose form, or therapeutic action is specified, so product or procedure codes are not appropriate."
122631007,Specimen from esophagus obtained by esophagogastrectomy (specimen),"Esophagus tissue, source procedure: esophagogastrectomy",The entry denotes esophageal tissue as a specimen and explicitly names esophagogastrectomy as the source procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122631007 is exact because it represents a specimen from the esophagus obtained by this combined resection. Broader concepts that only indicate esophageal origin or only indicate the procedure would be less specific. Describing the specimen as “tissue” is a common synonym for specimen and does not add attributes like extent or associated conditions.
405030008,Breastfeeding weaning (observable entity),Nutrition assessment records breastfeeding weaning,"The phrase indicates the observation of weaning from breastfeeding within a nutrition assessment context. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 405030008 is the most precise because it captures the specific observable of breastfeeding weaning. Parent concepts like nutrition status or infant feeding in general are broader, and sibling concepts such as cessation of breastfeeding would misstate completion. The wording is a contextual variation without additional attributes."
1373351003,American Joint Committee on Cancer aM1c(1) (qualifier value),Pathway documentation: AJCC aM1c(1),"This entry records the pathway documentation containing AJCC aM1c(1), mapping directly to SNOMED CT concept 1373351003. The medical concept is the AJCC anatomic M category qualifier aM1c(1), and the attribute is the exact subcategory encoded. It belongs to the Qualifier value hierarchy. The 'a' prefix and '(1)' subdesignation ensure it does not align with cM1c(1), pM1c(1), or a generic aM1c without the numeric detail. The wording is a safe synonym and does not introduce new attributes beyond the staging value itself."
224924009,Cottage hospital (environment),Service location: cottage hospital,"The wording specifies the location where the service is delivered as a cottage hospital, without adding attributes. The central concept is care environment. This maps to the SNOMED Environment hierarchy, best captured by Cottage hospital (environment), SCTID 224924009. It is more exact than Hospital (environment) and does not infer other hospital categories. 'Service location' is a neutral synonym for environment and keeps coding unchanged."
43350001,"History and physical examination, license (procedure)",License exam H&P performed.,"This entry confirms that an H&P was performed in the context of a license exam, without introducing extent or outcomes. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It is an exact fit for 43350001, reflecting an H&P tied to licensure rather than general or other-purpose H&Ps. The shorthand 'license exam H&P' is semantically equivalent and does not change the concept."
266889000,Family history: Hemophilia (situation),Pedigree notation indicates family history of hemophilia,"This entry refers to pedigree documentation showing hemophilia in the family history, without specifying hemophilia type or any particular relative. The concept is a family history Situation in SNOMED CT. Code 266889000 (Family history: Hemophilia) is the most accurate. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling or child concepts with subtype or relative specificity would be more detailed than the statement supports. The term 'pedigree' denotes documentation context and does not alter the coded concept."
48833008,Ovis dalli (organism),Chart notation: Dall sheep (Ovis dalli),"This entry uses both the common and scientific names, Dall sheep (Ovis dalli), to denote the same species-level organism. It is an Organism concept mapping to SCTID 48833008. Parent concepts like generic sheep or sibling species are not as precise, and subspecies codes are too narrow. The chart notation context does not change the code selection; the wording remains a straightforward organism reference."
441508005,Product containing C1 esterase inhibitor (product),C1 esterase inhibitor therapeutic product,"The concept is a therapeutic product whose active moiety is C1 esterase inhibitor. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Pharmaceutical/biologic product (Product) hierarchy. The most precise code is 441508005, which covers products containing C1 esterase inhibitor without implying brand, source, or formulation. Parent concepts (therapeutic product generally) are too broad, and children (human plasma–derived or recombinant C1-INH products, or branded items) are too specific. The term “therapeutic product” is a safe synonym for medicinal product and does not introduce additional attributes."
218066001,Accident caused by tin can lid (event),Accident documented as caused by tin can lid,"The entry notes the documentation of an accident with causation attributed to a tin can lid. The central concept is an accidental event with a defined cause, aligning with Event in SNOMED CT. SCTID 218066001 is the exact match because it includes the specific causal agent (tin can lid). Parent concepts lack causal detail, and injury-specific children would add details not present in this entry."
256237001,Temperature change (physical force),Temperature change encountered in environment,"This conveys that a temperature change was encountered in the environment, emphasizing an external ambient condition. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Physical force, capturing temperature change as an environmental factor. No additional attributes like direction, severity, timing, or causation are introduced, so Temperature change (physical force) is the correct code. Parent Physical force is too general, and sibling/child concepts specifying extreme hot/cold or directionality would not fit the neutral wording. Encountered is narrative context and does not alter the concept's identity."
223988003,Welsh island (geographic location),Imaging site: Welsh island,"The entry specifies the imaging site as a Welsh island, clearly denoting a geographic location. The appropriate SNOMED CT code is “Welsh island” (223988003). A generic island parent would omit the Welsh qualifier, and any specific island child would go beyond the given wording. The phrasing is a direct synonym that preserves the concept without extra attributes."
224703007,En suite bathroom (environment),Bedroom with en suite bathroom,"This entry indicates that the bedroom features an en suite bathroom, maintaining the essential relationship of bathroom being directly connected to the bedroom. No extra attributes are provided. The SNOMED category is Environment, with the best match being En suite bathroom (environment). Using simply Bathroom (environment) would omit the attachment detail, and terms like private bathroom can shift to a different sibling concept. The phrase is a clinically equivalent paraphrase aligned to the en suite bathroom concept."
424975005,Record entry (record artifact),Entry exists in the medical record,"This expresses the existence of an entry in the medical record without any subtype specification. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Record entry (record artifact) [424975005] is the most specific appropriate code. Parent-level concepts would be overly broad, and child/sibling artifacts like Discharge summary, Pathology report, or Prescription are not suggested by the wording."
1812481000004109,International Society of Urological Pathology prostate cancer staging system (staging scale),International Society of Urological Pathology prostate neoplasm staging system,"This entry names the ISUP staging system for prostate neoplasm, i.e., prostate cancer, clearly indicating the staging scale. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value — Staging scale (assessment scale). It is the most precise match because it specifies ISUP and staging of the prostate cancer entity. Broader parent scales are less specific, and sibling concepts like AJCC/TNM staging or ISUP grading do not correspond to the text. “Neoplasm” is a clinically equivalent synonym."
701525003,Sterile ultrasound coupling gel (physical object),Sterile echography coupling gel,"“Echography” is a synonym for ultrasound; this entry describes a sterile coupling gel for echographic imaging. SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The sterilization attribute is explicit. No other attributes (e.g., packaging, quantity, use procedure) are introduced, and it does not refer to non-ultrasound gels or nonsterile variants. Thus, the concept maps precisely to SCTID 701525003."
730982000,Entire C3 vertebral foramen (body structure),C3 vertebral foramen,"The entry names the anatomical structure: the vertebral foramen of the third cervical vertebra (C3). This is a Body structure in SNOMED CT and corresponds most precisely to Entire C3 vertebral foramen (SCTID 730982000), which denotes the whole foramen at that level. It does not introduce any condition or attribute (e.g., stenosis, trauma, laterality, or partiality). A parent concept like Vertebral foramen lacks the C3 specificity, and sibling structures such as the C3 transverse foramen or the C3 intervertebral (neural) foramen are different anatomical openings. Child concepts that describe parts of the C3 vertebral foramen would be too narrow, whereas this entry denotes the entire structure."
89328005,"Stimulation of bile secretion, function (observable entity)",Problem list entry: stimulation of bile secretion function,"This phrasing references the same concept in a problem list context, but the core content is the function of stimulating bile secretion. The main concept is the stimulatory physiologic function. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 89328005 remains the best match because the concept is a function, not a disorder or clinical procedure. The context label 'Problem list entry' does not change the underlying meaning or add attributes, so parent concepts like general bile secretion or siblings like inhibition would be less accurate."
223811000,Offaly (geographic location),Offaly,"The entry states the geographic place name Offaly without qualification. In SNOMED CT, this maps directly and most precisely to Offaly (geographic location), SCTID 223811000, which is in the Location hierarchy under geographic locations. No additional attributes (such as subareas, timing, or relationships) are introduced, so parent concepts like 'Geographic location' or sibling counties are too broad or incorrect, and child concepts like towns within Offaly are not implied."
128171007,Tissue specimen from stomach (specimen),Gastric tissue (specimen),"This phrasing identifies a specimen comprised of gastric (stomach) tissue and maps precisely to Tissue specimen from stomach (SCTID 128171007). SNOMED CT category: Specimen (Physical object). It does not add attributes like biopsy versus resection or mucosal versus full thickness, so specialized child concepts are not appropriate. A parent capturing any stomach specimen would be too broad since tissue is explicitly indicated here. 'Gastric' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'stomach.'"
467153000,Bath board (physical object),Patient reports using a bath board,"The concept is a bath board, mentioned via patient-reported usage. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The device identified is explicitly the bath board, fitting SCTID 467153000. A parent like bathing aid would be less specific, and siblings such as bath seat or transfer bench represent different equipment. The usage context does not add features or constraints that change the code."
262551003,Flea bites (event),Impression: flea bites,"The clinical impression states the event of flea bites, not a sequela or injury. No attributes beyond the agent (flea) are included. The SNOMED CT category is Event, with the precise code 262551003 Flea bites (event). Parent concepts like Animal bite (event) are insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts involving other insects would misrepresent the agent. 'Impression' is a context label that does not alter code selection."
19649008,Crossoptilon auritum (organism),Taxon: Crossoptilon auritum,"‘Taxon’ here identifies the exact species-level taxon Crossoptilon auritum, not a genus or family. The concept belongs to the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy, and SCTID 19649008 is the correct code. Mapping to a parent (genus Crossoptilon) would lose specificity, and mapping to another eared-pheasant species would be inaccurate. The entry is strictly taxonomic, adding no clinical or situational attributes."
396806000,"Specimen from pancreas obtained by pancreaticoduodenectomy, partial pancreatectomy (specimen)",Pancreas specimen obtained via Whipple operation,"Main concept: a specimen from the pancreas obtained via the Whipple operation, synonymous with pancreaticoduodenectomy. Category: Specimen. This maps specifically to SCTID 396806000 by naming the organ and exact source procedure. Parent-level “pancreas specimen” lacks the procedural detail, and siblings covering other types of pancreatectomy would misclassify the source. “Whipple operation” is clinically equivalent to pancreaticoduodenectomy and maintains the intended concept."
463112009,"Pulmonary artery catheter, standard (physical object)","Pulmonary artery catheter, standard type","This phrasing identifies the device as a pulmonary artery catheter and adds 'standard type,' which aligns exactly with the standard variant concept 'Pulmonary artery catheter, standard' (SCTID: 463112009). The category is Physical object (Device). It is more specific than the generic parent because the type is specified, and it does not introduce child/sibling features like oximetry, pacing, or thermodilution. No procedural or state attributes are implied."
726555002,Percutaneous angioplasty of transplanted hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance with contrast (procedure),Percutaneous angioplasty—transplanted hepatic vein—fluoroscopic guidance with contrast agent.,"The entry captures the essential components: percutaneous angioplasty of the transplanted hepatic vein with fluoroscopic guidance using contrast agent. It is a Procedure, with SCTID 726555002 being the exact code. Broader parents omit transplant or guidance details, and siblings such as angioplasty of non-transplanted hepatic vein or using alternative guidance diverge from the stated procedure. The phrasing introduces no extra attributes beyond the concept’s scope."
846744006,Cataract of left eye present (situation),Cataract of left eye present,"The main concept is an explicitly present cataract localized to the left eye. Attributes expressed are laterality (left) and assertion of presence. This aligns with a Situation with explicit context SNOMED CT category, not a disorder term, because the phrase includes the explicit presence context. SCTID 846744006 (Cataract of left eye present) is the most precise match. The disorder concept 'Cataract of left eye' lacks the explicit presence context and is therefore less appropriate. Sibling situations such as 'Cataract of right eye present' or 'Cataract of left eye absent' do not fit the wording. No additional attributes (type, severity, cause) are introduced."
15075002,Structure of intervertebral disc space of sixth cervical vertebra (body structure),Palpation reference: C6 disc interspace,"This statement designates the intervertebral disc space at C6 as a reference point, remaining an anatomical term without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 15075002 fits because it represents the structure of the intervertebral disc space of the sixth cervical vertebra. A generic parent like 'cervical disc space' is too broad, and disc tissue or specific adjacent levels would be different concepts. 'Disc interspace' is a recognized synonym for 'intervertebral disc space.'"
160806000,Father remarried (situation),Father is remarried.,"Main concept: father remarried, cast as ongoing status. SNOMED CT category: Situation. The phrase indicates that the father’s marital status reflects a remarriage, which aligns with the situation concept 160806000. It avoids timing, partner details, or implications of step-relatives. Parent concepts would be overly general, and siblings (e.g., “Mother remarried”) do not fit. The copula form maintains equivalence to the preferred term."
213960008,Killed by rolling stock - railway employee (event),Railroad employee killed by rolling stock,"This text identifies a fatality (killed) caused by rolling stock and specifies the victim as a railroad employee, which is synonymous with railway employee. It is an Event concept. SCTID 213960008 matches exactly by combining cause (rolling stock), outcome (death), and role (railway/railroad employee). A generic cause-of-death entry without the occupational role would be less precise, while siblings for nonfatal injury or different roles are incorrect. “Railroad” is an acceptable synonym for “railway” and does not change the intended code."
22520006,Murutucu virus (organism),Murutucu virus (organism),"This entry explicitly names the organism and clarifies its hierarchy by including “(organism),” without introducing any clinical state or event. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. Murutucu virus (organism), SCTID 22520006, is the exact and most specific concept for a taxon reference. Broader parents like Virus or Bunyaviridae would be less precise, and any child concept involving detection or infection would add attributes not present in the wording."
162594009,Deafness suspected (situation),Deafness under consideration (suspected).,"Main concept: deafness being considered, i.e., suspected but not diagnosed. SNOMED CT category: Situation. The wording explicitly communicates suspicion, matching Deafness suspected (situation) SCTID 162594009. It does not include any qualifiers such as laterality, etiology, timing, or severity. A parent concept like confirmed deafness or a sibling like hearing loss suspected would be less precise because the term is specific and unconfirmed."
736773006,Reconstruction of scalp using rotational flap (procedure),Rotation flap reconstruction to scalp,"This communicates a Procedure involving reconstructive rotation (rotational) flap surgery applied to the scalp. It precisely matches SCTID 736773006, identifying reconstruction at the scalp using a rotational flap. Parent concepts lack the technique detail, and sibling concepts differ in flap method. The slight wording variation remains clinically equivalent and avoids adding attributes."
411247003,Diazolidinylurea (in water) (product),Diazolidinyl urea dissolved in water,"This statement communicates the formulation attribute that diazolidinyl urea is dissolved in water, without adding dose, route, or concentration. It is a Product concept and aligns exactly with 411247003 Diazolidinylurea (in water) (product). More general parent concepts would fail to capture the water vehicle, and sibling concepts describing other solvents would not match. “Dissolved in water” is a precise paraphrase of “in water.”"
297281006,Electric potential (physical force),Physical force: electric potential,"This phrasing identifies electric potential as a physical force, which fits the SNOMED CT category Physical force and maps precisely to Electric potential (physical force) SCTID 297281006. The entry does not introduce measurement, risk, exposure, or outcome, avoiding misclassification to observable entities like Voltage or to external cause findings. It is more specific than the parent Physical force and does not imply a sibling such as electric field or current."
699415006,Trophozoite of Entamoeba histolytica-Entamoeba dispar complex (organism),Documentation: Entamoeba histolytica–Entamoeba dispar trophozoite,"Main concept: trophozoite life stage of the histolytica–dispar complex. Attribute: stage = trophozoite. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The context 'Documentation' is neutral; the organism phrase exactly matches SCTID 699415006. Broader organism codes lacking stage are less precise, while cyst-stage or single-species trophozoites are siblings/children that do not match. No clinical finding or infection is asserted."
388248008,Genus Ammotragus (organism),Report references Ammotragus (genus),"This statement references the organism genus Ammotragus. Category: Organism. It most precisely maps to SNOMED CT 388248008 (Genus Ammotragus). Selecting a parent (e.g., Bovidae) would broaden the scope beyond the genus, and choosing a specific species would not be supported. The reporting context is non-attribute and keeps the focus strictly on the genus-level organism."
118367002,Blue laser light (physical force),Blue laser light described,This patient- or clinician-facing phrasing retains the exact physical force—blue laser light—without adding attributes or implying a procedure or exposure event. It matches SNOMED CT 118367002 Blue laser light (physical force). A parent like Laser light lacks color specificity; a sibling like Blue light lacks the laser qualifier; thus the chosen concept is the most accurate.
285650006,Magnetism (physical force),Force of magnetism,"The phrase is a direct paraphrase of magnetism as a force and does not introduce new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. Magnetism (physical force) [285650006] is the exact match, as the entry targets the phenomenon of magnetic force rather than environmental fields, exposure scenarios, or medical technologies. Parent Physical force is too broad, and siblings like Electricity or Electromagnetism describe different forces, making magnetism the correct specific code."
411142001,Paraben mix (product),Test kit component: paraben mix,"This entry indicates that the product is a component of a test kit, while the concept remains the product “paraben mix.” No allergy or diagnostic result is asserted. The SNOMED category is Product. SNOMED CT 411142001 is the most precise match. It should not be coded to a general kit or testing procedure, nor to generic paraben products (parent) or single-paraben items (child). The context label does not alter the coded concept."
702112000,Skin treatment sock (physical object),Patient wears a skin treatment sock,"This patient-reported context identifies the same physical object—a skin treatment sock—without adding clinical attributes beyond use. The category is Physical object. SCTID 702112000 matches the device precisely. More generic parent codes for socks lack the treatment purpose, and other sibling devices (e.g., compression socks, stockings) are not mentioned. The wording avoids details like laterality, frequency, or indications, keeping the mapping to the exact concept."
245069001,Structure of tendon of scalenus medius (body structure),Imaging anatomy: tendon of the middle scalene,"The entry identifies the imaging anatomy of interest as the tendon of the middle scalene (scalenus medius), without adding condition or laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It best maps to SCTID 245069001 because it directly names the tendon of scalenus medius. Parent concepts for general scalene tendons would be nonspecific, and sibling concepts (anterior/posterior scalene tendons) are not applicable. It does not mention an attachment site or subportion, avoiding child concept mapping."
736375002,Hemodialysis care plan (record artifact),Chart: hemodialysis care plan,"This phrasing indicates that the chart contains a hemodialysis care plan, keeping the focus on the plan artifact and adding no new attributes. SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The exact code is Hemodialysis care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736375002. Parent or generic plan concepts lack the modality detail present here, and sibling dialysis modalities do not apply. This does not represent a clinical finding or the performance of hemodialysis but the documented care plan."
762614005,Sextuplets with all six stillborn (finding),Narrative: she had sextuplets and all six were born dead.,“Born dead” is clinically equivalent to “stillborn.” This narrative clearly states sextuplets and that each was stillborn. The concept is a Clinical finding precisely captured by SCTID 762614005. Parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate because they either lack outcome specificity or describe different multiple counts/outcomes. No extraneous attributes are introduced.
256781008,Glans skin flap (substance),Intraoperative tissue: glans skin flap,"This identifies the intraoperative tissue as a skin flap from the glans, directly mapping to the SNOMED CT Substance 'Glans skin flap' (256781008). The term avoids introducing technique (pedicled/free), thickness, donor status, laterality, or timing details beyond context. A parent concept such as 'Skin flap (substance)' is not sufficiently specific, and a sibling that references other tissue (e.g., mucosa) or other penile areas would be inaccurate. Therefore, the most precise code is 256781008."
721919000,Nurse discharge summary (record artifact),RN discharge summary,"The main concept is a discharge summary authored by an RN (registered nurse), which is a specific type of nurse and therefore fits the nurse-authored artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The most precise mapping is Nurse discharge summary (record artifact) SCTID 721919000 because RN falls under nurse authorship. Using Discharge summary alone would drop the author role, and siblings like Physician discharge summary or other professional-specific summaries would be incorrect. 'RN' is a clinically safe synonym for nurse here and does not alter the code selection."
246521001,Weight of resected tissue (qualifier value),Tissue weight (resected),"This label-style entry presents the attribute 'tissue weight' and clarifies the context '(resected)', making it clear the property applies to surgically removed tissue. The main concept is the property 'weight' of resected tissue. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It aligns with SCTID 246521001 as it denotes the same qualifier without stating a measured result. Broader parents (e.g., tissue weight without context) are under-specified; siblings such as 'length of resected tissue' or 'specimen weight' shift to different attributes or scopes. The parenthetical clarification keeps the coding precise to the intended concept."
118341007,Q-switched laser beam (physical force),Q-switched laser beam utilized during session,"This context indicates utilization of a Q-switched laser beam, but does not introduce the purpose, target, wavelength, or laser medium, keeping the focus on the physical force. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. SCTID 118341007 is the most precise code due to the explicit Q-switching; parent 'laser beam' lacks specificity, and siblings (e.g., continuous-wave laser beam) are not supported by the wording. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and leaves code selection unchanged."
85496008,Chenopodium album (organism),Botanical species confirmed: Chenopodium album,"This statement confirms the botanical species Chenopodium album. Category: Organism. Confirmation is contextual and does not introduce new clinical attributes; the core concept remains the organism species. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 85496008 and excludes broader (genus) or different concepts (pollen, substance, product). No sibling species are implied, ensuring the species-level organism code is most accurate."
265138009,Primary open reduction of fracture of elbow and fixation with Hook fixation plate (procedure),Emergency to OR: Primary open reduction of elbow fracture and hook plate fixation,"This entry documents that the patient went emergently to the OR for a primary open reduction of an elbow fracture with hook plate fixation. Concepts: elbow fracture, open reduction, hook plate fixation, primary. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The precise mapping is SCTID 265138009 because it includes the primary open reduction and the specific hook fixation plate. Sibling/parent concepts that describe closed reduction, external fixation, unspecified plate, or revision do not match the explicit wording. The urgency context does not change the procedure specifications."
285660002,Deceleration (physical force),Deceleration observed,"This phrase indicates observation of deceleration as a force, not describing outcomes or adding qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. Deceleration (physical force) [285660002] is the correct match because it identifies the specific force of reduced velocity. Parent Physical force is too broad, while siblings such as Acceleration or Impact are different forces. No attributes (severity, timing, cause, associated conditions) are included, so the unqualified deceleration force is the precise concept to encode."
223666001,France (geographic location),Travel history: France,"France is specified within a travel history context, but the coded entity remains the geographic location. The main concept is France; 'Travel history' is a note section label. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). France (geographic location) SCTID 223666001 is the correct code that represents the country. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., other countries) are not indicated, and child subdivisions of France are not mentioned. The entry avoids timing or severity details, keeping the mapping uniquely to the country-level location."
16309008,"Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase (substance)","Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase","The entry names the specific enzyme carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase without any qualifiers or added context. The main medical concept is the enzyme itself, which in SNOMED CT is modeled as a Substance. This maps directly and precisely to SCTID 16309008 (carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase (substance)). Broader parent concepts like Enzyme (substance) would be less specific, and sibling concepts such as cis,cis-muconate cyclase lacking the 'carboxy' designation would not capture the exact molecule named here. No attributes such as activity, deficiency, source, or formulation are stated, so the substance concept is the most accurate code."
122574004,Duodenal fluid specimen (specimen),Follow-up: pending duodenal fluid sample results,"The follow-up context notes a sample whose type is duodenal fluid, which is fluid from the duodenum as a specimen. Category: Specimen. Duodenal fluid specimen (122574004) is appropriate because the entry focuses on the specimen identity without method or associated conditions. Broader parents (intestinal fluid specimen) and method-specific siblings (aspirate) do not fit. The word “sample” is a synonymous term for specimen and does not alter the code."
766747005,Exploration of bilateral adrenal glands (procedure),Follow-up record: bilateral adrenal glands exploration,"The follow-up record notes the procedure of exploration of both adrenal glands, with bilaterality stated. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The correct match is Exploration of bilateral adrenal glands (procedure), SCTID 766747005, because it reflects the bilateral scope without adding approach or other actions. A parent concept lacking bilaterality is less specific, and unilateral sibling procedures would contradict the wording. The entry does not introduce planning or history-of semantics beyond documenting the completed procedure."
734337004,Specimen from mass of nasopharynx (specimen),Specimen: mass of nasopharynx,"This label-style entry clearly identifies the specimen’s anatomic source as a mass of the nasopharynx, matching SNOMED CT 'Specimen from mass of nasopharynx' (734337004). Category: Specimen. The absence of method (biopsy, excision, FNA) or tissue subtype means it should not be coded to a more specific child. The explicit 'mass' attribute makes it more precise than a general 'Specimen from nasopharynx' parent and avoids siblings referring to lesions or tumors."
1340117000,Ripasudil hydrochloride (substance),Substance: ripasudil hydrochloride,"This entry labels the item explicitly as a substance and names ripasudil hydrochloride, with no additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It aligns exactly with SCTID 1340117000. Concepts for medicinal products or preparations would require dose form or strength, which are not present, and the parent ripasudil (substance) would omit the hydrochloride specification."
225645007,Fear of wetting self in public (finding),Worried about wetting self in public,"This states worry about wetting oneself in public, which is equivalent to fear. Main concept: worry/fear of public self-wetting; attribute: public context. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. SCTID 225645007 fits exactly because the phrase includes the specific outcome and setting. Parent concepts such as general worry are too nonspecific, and incontinence disorders reflect actual leakage, which is not present here. ‘Worried about’ is a clinically safe synonym that preserves intent."
14715007,Dextran 75 (substance),Dextran (75 kDa),"The concept expressed is the dextran polymer with a specified molecular weight of 75 kilodaltons, which is synonymous with Dextran 75. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The explicit 75 kDa designation requires the Dextran 75 (SCTID 14715007) code rather than the generic Dextran (substance) or other molecular-weight variants. There is no added context that would shift coding to a medicinal product or procedure."
411937008,Dolichovespula maculata venom specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),D. maculata venom diagnostic allergen extract,"The abbreviated species (D. maculata) still unambiguously refers to Dolichovespula maculata, and the entry states this is a venom-based diagnostic allergen extract. The concept is a Product, matching Dolichovespula maculata venom specific diagnostic allergen extract (SCTID 411937008). Broader parents (e.g., generic vespid venom extract) would lose the named species detail, and siblings for other vespid species are inconsistent with the wording. No therapeutic or procedural attributes are introduced; it remains a diagnostic allergen extract product."
284559008,Boating marina (environment),Locale: boating marina,"The entry identifies the locale as a boating marina, directly pointing to the environmental concept. Category: Environment (environment). It neither generalizes to a broad waterfront area nor specifies a different structure like a dock or jetty. No additional clinical attributes are added, so the most accurate SNOMED CT match is 284559008 Boating marina (environment)."
1231799000,History of revision of treatment of root canal of anterior tooth (situation),Previously revised root canal of a front tooth noted,"This phrasing indicates a previously revised (retreated) root canal on a front tooth, which corresponds to an anterior tooth. The concept is historical and localized to the anterior region, making it a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 1231799000 is the most precise match. Selecting a procedure concept would be incorrect because the action is not current, and broader concepts without the anterior specification would be less precise."
224909000,Sixth floor (environment),Sixth storey,"“Sixth storey” uses the term storey (floor) to denote the sixth level of a building, mapping to Sixth floor (environment) [224909000]. The main concept is strictly the environmental level, with no specific building type, unit, or functional area. SNOMED CT category: Environment. General storey or floor concepts are parents that lack numeric specificity; any other numbered storey is a sibling and would be incorrect. The British English synonym “storey” is clinically equivalent to “floor” and does not change code selection."
408471009,Cardiothoracic transplantation (qualifier value),Cardiothoracic transplant domain,"“Domain” denotes the categorical scope of transplantation relevant to cardiothoracic structures, consistent with a qualifier value. There are no added attributes or organ specifics. The most precise match is Qualifier value 408471009. A parent without cardiothoracic context would be insufficiently specific; sibling procedure concepts (e.g., cardiac transplant) would inappropriately imply a specific intervention rather than a categorical value."
448757004,Angulation osteotomy of diaphysis and external fixation (procedure),Radiograph: status post diaphyseal angulation osteotomy stabilized by external fixation,"Imaging wording documents a prior angulation osteotomy at the diaphysis with ongoing external fixation stabilization, exactly describing the targeted procedure. Category: Procedure. It best maps to 448757004 since both components—diaphyseal angulation osteotomy and external fixation—are present. Parent entries lacking fixation or angulation would not be as accurate, and siblings such as internal fixation or rotational osteotomy are inconsistent. The radiographic context does not alter the underlying procedure."
444400000,Exposure to Streptococcus (event),Microbiology note: exposure to Streptococcus,"The entry indicates a microbiology documentation context while stating exposure to Streptococcus only. No disease state, species, or timing attributes are included. SNOMED CT category: Event. The appropriate code is Exposure to Streptococcus (event) [444400000]. Concepts for general exposure to bacteria are too broad, and species-specific exposure entries are not warranted by this general genus mention. The context label does not affect the concept selection."
422239001,Oregon (geographic location),State of Oregon,"The wording explicitly identifies Oregon as a state, which is a synonymic clarification of the same geographic entity. The concept type is Geographic location, and the correct SNOMED CT code is Oregon (geographic location) SCTID 422239001. It does not introduce any other attribute or suggest a different administrative subdivision. It avoids broader concepts such as the country and excludes more granular child entities like cities or counties, keeping the mapping exact."
1141724004,No injury due to laser (situation),Patient reports no injury from laser.,"This is a patient-reported negative statement specifically about injury caused by a laser, which matches 'No injury due to laser' (SCTID: 1141724004). Category: Situation. The patient context does not alter the core concept; no extra attributes are added. It is more precise than generic 'no injury' and clearly distinct from any concepts asserting presence of injury."
1260427008,Maternal antepartum and/or intrapartum and/or postpartum period (qualifier value),Documentation context: maternal AP/IP/PP period,"The entry uses AP (antepartum), IP (intrapartum), and PP (postpartum) abbreviations to denote the maternal timing context for documentation. This is a Qualifier value usage and maps directly to SCTID 1260427008, which includes any of these maternal stages. Selecting a single-stage qualifier would be too specific relative to the inclusive phrase. The abbreviations are clinically conventional and semantically equivalent, adding no extraneous attributes."
258488008,Lymph node smear (specimen),Pathology specimen is a lymph node smear,"The statement identifies the specimen submitted to pathology as a smear from a lymph node. The main concept is the specimen type; no attributes like technique (e.g., FNA), site details beyond 'lymph node', or timing are included. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. 'Lymph node smear (specimen)' 258488008 is the exact match. Parent concepts such as 'Lymph node specimen' are too broad and include tissue or aspirate forms, while sibling concepts like 'Lymph node biopsy specimen' would misclassify the preparation."
257691003,Road junction (environment),Road junction location,"This concise entry indicates the location is a road junction, and it adds no other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps exactly to 257691003 Road junction (environment), avoiding both overly broad parent concepts and specific child/sibling junction types, thus representing the most accurate code choice."
257616009,Forest (environment),Forest environs,"“Environs” refers to the environment or surroundings, specified as forest. No extra attributes like cause or subtype are present. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Environment, and Forest (environment) SCTID 257616009 fits exactly. Broader parent categories would be less precise, and forest subtype children are not implied. The synonym is a linguistic paraphrase that maintains the same concept and coding."
430297000,Cytologic material obtained from unspecified body site (specimen),Cytopathology sample—anatomic site unspecified,"This denotes a cytopathology sample (a synonym for cytologic material) and explicitly states the anatomic site is unspecified, aligning with the Specimen code 430297000. It refrains from naming a site or method, preventing misclassification into more specific child/sibling concepts such as cervical cytology or aspirate cytology. The synonym does not change semantics, and 'anatomic site unspecified' matches the target qualifier."
249354004,Moistness of nasal mucosa (observable entity),Nasal mucosa moisture status (no value),"This entry states that the status of the moisture of the nasal mucosa is being referenced, explicitly noting that no value is provided, which keeps it within the Observable entity domain. The precise match is Moistness of nasal mucosa (SCTID: 249354004). Broader parent observables or those lacking site specification would be less accurate, and sibling or child finding concepts that specify dryness, increased moisture, or normal moisture would incorrectly add a result not present."
702510000,Corticated fertile egg of Ascaris lumbricoides (organism),Parasitic organism: corticated fertile egg of Ascaris lumbricoides,"The entry identifies a parasitic organism and provides the species, stage, and defining attributes: egg, corticated, fertile. This corresponds to the Organism category and maps to SNOMED CT 702510000, which specifically describes the corticated fertile egg of A. lumbricoides. More general parent concepts or sibling variants (e.g., decorticated or infertile) would not match the stated features. The contextual phrase 'Parasitic organism' does not introduce a finding; it simply frames the organism type."
180787005,Abductor hallucis myocutaneous flap (substance),Abductor hallucis muscle-skin flap,"“Muscle-skin flap” is a standard clinical paraphrase of a myocutaneous flap, and specifying abductor hallucis as the source confines the meaning to that particular tissue substance. This belongs to the Substance hierarchy. The most specific code is Abductor hallucis myocutaneous flap (substance), SCTID 180787005. Parent terms like muscle-skin flap without the source are too broad, and sibling concepts with different tissue mixes or sources would be inaccurate. The entry does not add attributes beyond the defined tissue type and source."
88999006,Heat (physical force),Heat indicated in report,"The report indicates heat, but no additional attributes like exposure, injury, environment, or intensity are provided. The concept fits the Physical force hierarchy, mapping precisely to Heat (physical force) [88999006]. Parent Physical force would be too broad, and child or sibling concepts such as heat exposure, thermal burn, or high ambient temperature add context or outcomes that are not stated. Thus, 88999006 is the exact match."
472929000,Central venous catheter tip submitted as specimen (specimen),CVC line tip provided as specimen,"This entry identifies the specimen as the tip of a central venous catheter (CVC) and indicates it was provided as a specimen. It fits the Specimen hierarchy and uniquely corresponds to SCTID 472929000. No diagnostic test, procedure, or additional attributes are introduced. A parent concept like catheter tip specimen is less precise, while sibling concepts for non-central catheters are excluded by “CVC.” The abbreviation and phrasing are clinically equivalent and do not change code selection."
409547007,Cold zone (environment),Reported being kept in the cold zone,"This patient-reported statement indicates placement within the cold zone, with the codable concept being the environmental zone itself. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the precise match is Cold zone (environment) [409547007]. The phrasing does not imply hot/warm zones, temperature, or contamination attributes; it simply confirms the environmental location. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling zones would be incorrect."
369439002,Entire foramen rotundum (body structure),Round foramen (foramen rotundum),"The phrase uses a common English synonym 'round foramen' and clarifies it with the standard term, which denotes the same anatomical opening. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 369439002 is appropriate because it captures the entire foramen rotundum; the synonym does not change scope or add attributes. Concepts like 'foramen ovale' or 'foramen lacerum' are distinct sibling structures, and sided variants would be too specific. No timing, severity, pathology, or laterality is implied."
411735008,Oncorhynchus mykiss diagnostic allergen extract (product),Oncorhynchus mykiss allergen extract for diagnostic use,"The wording highlights the species (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and states that the allergen extract is for diagnostic use, which characterizes a testing product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This matches SCTID 411735008 since it’s a diagnostic allergen extract derived from rainbow trout. Parent-level diagnostic extracts without species are too broad, while other fish species would be incorrect. The phrase does not imply immunotherapy or contain test outcomes, supporting the chosen product concept."
431900006,Marking of skin of spine using magnetic resonance imaging guidance (procedure),Marking the spinal skin under MR imaging guidance,"This entry indicates that spinal skin was marked under MR imaging guidance, capturing the procedure's action, site, and modality. It belongs to the Procedure category, and SCTID 431900006 is the most precise code. Concepts lacking MRI guidance or specifying other modalities are less accurate. 'MR imaging' is a standard synonym for MRI, and the phrasing does not introduce extra attributes."
399273000,Sagittal-oblique axial emissive projection (qualifier value),Axial emissive projection with sagittal-oblique alignment,"The entry defines an axial emissive projection with sagittal-oblique alignment, which is the same geometry as the preferred term. The main concept is the projection qualifier. SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It aligns with 399273000 by including emissive basis, axial plane, and sagittal-oblique orientation. A parent like “axial emissive projection” lacking the obliquity would be underspecified, and siblings specifying other alignments or planes would be incorrect. “Alignment” here is a synonym for orientation and does not alter the concept."
287972005,Introitus enlarged (situation),"On inspection, the introitus is enlarged","The sentence conveys an observed enlarged introitus, without additional detail such as cause or severity. This closely matches 'Introitus enlarged (situation)' SCTID 287972005, categorized as a Situation with explicit context of presence. Using a more general parent concept would lose specificity, and body-site or etiology-specific children would add information not in the text. 'Is enlarged' is a direct synonym confirming the same coding."
223899002,South Yorkshire (geographic location),Named location: South Yorkshire,"The text conveys that the named location is South Yorkshire, avoiding any clinical or relational attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 223899002 is exact because the entry refers to the place South Yorkshire, not to a parent (Yorkshire/England) or a child locality (e.g., Sheffield). The contextual phrase 'Named location' does not change the concept; it simply identifies the value as a geographic name."
285400005,Air pressure (physical force),Air pressure as the physical force,"The statement identifies air pressure specifically as the physical force involved, without adding details such as intensity or location. This is a Physical force and maps to Air pressure (physical force) [285400005]. Using the parent Physical force would be too broad, and selecting more specific or different-context concepts (e.g., atmospheric pressure, airway pressure, exposure to air pressure) would be incorrect because those attributes are not stated. The wording is an explicit restatement of the same concept."
309101008,Cartilage specimen (specimen),Chondral tissue specimen,"The adjective ‘chondral’ is clinically synonymous with ‘cartilage,’ and the entry identifies a tissue specimen without adding extra attributes. The main concept is a specimen of cartilage tissue, in the SNOMED CT Specimen category. The appropriate code is ‘Cartilage specimen (specimen)’ SCTID: 309101008 because the material is cartilage. Parents are too general, while children or siblings with biopsy method or specific cartilage subtypes would be inaccurate for this phrasing. Using ‘chondral’ does not alter the concept and remains semantically equivalent."
52250000,X-ray electromagnetic radiation (physical force),X-ray EMR,"Here 'EMR' stands for electromagnetic radiation, and the phrase specifically denotes X-ray electromagnetic radiation with no procedural, exposure, or dosing qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, matched by SCTID 52250000. The abbreviation does not alter clinical meaning and remains equivalent to the preferred term. It is more specific than parent concepts such as undifferentiated radiation and does not imply sibling bands (e.g., UV) or child variants; thus, the base X-ray radiation code is appropriate."
285722004,Mechanical crushing (physical force),Mechanical crushing as the mechanism,"The statement explicitly identifies mechanical crushing as the mechanism and includes no other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It precisely corresponds to Mechanical crushing (physical force) SCTID 285722004. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., generic crushing, compression, blunt force) do not match as well, and injuries are not claimed, ruling out disorder mappings."
1348227000,Fall from horse (event),EMS note: fall from horse,"The source of documentation (EMS) does not alter the clinical event: a fall from a horse. The main concept is the event of falling from a horse, with no additional attributes such as timing, severity, or injuries. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This wording maps exactly to Fall from horse (event), SCTID 1348227000, and is more specific than parent or broader sibling concepts."
77627007,75V-2621 virus (organism),Microorganism name: 75V-2621 virus,"This entry states the microorganism name as 75V-2621 virus and includes no clinical attributes such as positivity or infection. Category is Organism. The exact organism SCTID 77627007 is the appropriate code because the entry is purely taxonomic. Parent or sibling concepts would be either broader or refer to different organisms. The descriptor 'microorganism name' is a neutral label, maintaining semantic equivalence."
73029005,Fibrinogen Baltimore IV (substance),Specified molecule: Fibrinogen Baltimore IV,"The entry identifies the named molecule as Fibrinogen Baltimore IV, maintaining focus on the exact substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 73029005 is appropriate because the text refers to the specific fibrinogen variant by name. A parent category like fibrinogen or fibrinogen variant is less precise, and sibling variants do not match the Baltimore IV designation. No clinical state or quantitative attribute is added."
69362002,Hospital-based ambulatory surgery facility (environment),Hospital-based ambulatory surgery facility,"The entry explicitly names the hospital-based ambulatory surgery facility, matching the SNOMED CT concept 69362002, which is categorized as an Environment. No attributes beyond the care setting are introduced. This is more precise than a parent or generic ambulatory surgery facility because it specifies the hospital-based context, and it avoids sibling concepts such as free-standing ambulatory surgery centers or generic hospital environments. The wording corresponds exactly to the preferred term, ensuring the most specific and correct code selection."
80123004,Lower middle class economic status (social concept),Socioeconomic status: lower middle class,"The text identifies the person’s socioeconomic status specifically as lower middle class, with no added qualifiers. This fits the Social concept category and maps directly to SNOMED CT 80123004. A parent concept like socioeconomic status without tier specification would be too general, and siblings (e.g., upper middle class, lower class) describe different tiers. The phrasing is a standard way clinicians document the same concept and does not change code selection."
8521000175109,Suicide plan (observable entity),Suicide plan reported in interview,"This entry indicates that during interview, a suicide plan was reported, confirming the existence of a plan and mapping to Suicide plan (observable entity) [8521000175109]. The interview context does not add clinical attributes; it remains an observation of a plan’s presence. It avoids details of method, timing, or intent strength, separating it from ideation, intent, or attempt concepts."
246560004,Foot preference (observable entity),Dominant foot per history,"Dominant foot per history conveys the historical report of foot preference, not specifying side or other attributes. It remains an Observable entity and matches SNOMED CT 246560004. Side-specific children are excluded due to no laterality; parent or sibling concepts like limb dominance or handedness do not match the foot-specific scope here."
79906008,Structure of genitofemoral nerve femoral branch (body structure),Dissection structure: femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve,"Within a dissection context, the named structure remains the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve, a Body structure that maps to SCTID 79906008. The entry does not include any attributes such as laterality, abnormality, or intervention details. Parent mapping to the entire nerve would be less specific, and sibling mapping (genital branch) would be incorrect. This is a clear, exact reference to the femoral branch structure."
394575008,Postnatal clinic (environment),Postnatal clinic environment,"The entry specifies the environment explicitly and names it as a postnatal clinic, which is an Environment concept in SNOMED CT. This maps most precisely to SCTID 394575008. Broader clinic environments would be less specific, and ward or unit settings are different facility types. The wording adds no details beyond identifying the environment, keeping the selection focused on the designated postnatal clinic."
721967005,Tissue pathology biopsy report (record artifact),Tissue pathology biopsy report in chart,"The entry identifies that the chart contains a tissue pathology biopsy report, which is a document artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It precisely matches 721967005, indicating a report of tissue pathology derived from a biopsy. More general report artifacts would lose specificity, while sibling concepts like cytology would be a different modality. The phrase adds only documentation context (‘in chart’) and introduces no clinical attributes or results."
285328003,Carbon dioxide laser light (physical force),Carbon dioxide laser light,"The entry explicitly names the physical force as carbon dioxide laser light, which is the emitted laser light from a CO2 laser source. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. This precisely matches SCTID 285328003 because it specifies the subtype of laser light as carbon dioxide rather than a generic laser. Parent concepts like Laser light (physical force) are too broad, and sibling concepts such as argon or Nd:YAG laser light are not appropriate because the wording identifies carbon dioxide specifically. It is not a device or a procedure, so device concepts or therapeutic procedure codes are excluded."
890098008,Contact with footwear (event),Clinician documented contact with footwear,"The entry specifies that a clinician documented the occurrence of contact with footwear, with no added attributes such as injury or temporality beyond normal documentation context. The main concept is contact with footwear. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This precisely matches SCTID 890098008; broader parent categories (e.g., contact with objects) are less specific, and sibling concepts pertaining to other garments or materials are not indicated."
313284006,Serum cortisol (substance),Patient was told about serum cortisol,"A patient statement referencing 'serum cortisol' still denotes the analyte cortisol in serum, which is a Substance concept. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Serum cortisol (SCTID 313284006). The wording does not introduce levels, timing, or procedures, so observable or test concepts are not indicated. The explicit serum context prevents mapping to broader cortisol or to other specimen-specific cortisol substances."
116305001,Coccyx finding (finding),Assessment includes a coccyx finding,"This indicates that the clinical assessment contains a finding focused on the coccyx, without details of type or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The assessment context does not modify the core concept. Parent classes are too general, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., coccygeal pain, injury) add unsupported specificity. Coccyx finding (116305001) is the most accurate match."
106153001,Third cranial nerve finding (finding),Third nerve finding mentioned in summary,"This entry conveys that a clinical finding concerning the third nerve (CN III) is noted in a summary, with no attribute detail provided. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The most precise match is 106153001 Third cranial nerve finding. Using a broader parent concept would omit nerve specificity, and mapping to children like palsy/dysfunction would infer abnormality absent from the statement. 'Third nerve' is a clinically accepted synonym for the third cranial (oculomotor) nerve and does not change the coding."
773433004,Obstetric antenatal care plan (record artifact),Obstetric prenatal care plan note,"This entry indicates a note documenting a prenatal (antenatal) care plan for obstetric care, clearly a record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It maps to 'Obstetric antenatal care plan (record artifact)' due to the combination of obstetric context and antenatal timing within a plan document. Procedural antenatal care codes or encounter codes would be incorrect, as this is about the recorded plan, not the delivery of care. The synonyms used do not alter the concept."
309972001,Dental surgery department (environment),Visited: Dental Surgery Department,"The entry indicates the place visited, but the coded concept is exclusively the environment: the dental surgery department. It is classified under Environment (environment) and corresponds to SNOMED CT 309972001. The verb 'visited' does not introduce clinical attributes that change the concept. Using a broader department or a different sibling environment like a dental clinic would be less precise than the specific dental surgery department."
309119004,Excised fascia specimen (specimen),Fascia excised—submitted as specimen,"This phrase indicates fascia was excised and submitted as a specimen, capturing both tissue identity and method without additional qualifiers. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 309119004 in the Specimen hierarchy. Using a parent fascia specimen would be less specific, and siblings such as fascia biopsy specimen would introduce a different method. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase to the preferred term."
1306624006,Photographic extraoral image of full face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Exam photos: full-face extraoral with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion,"This entry refers to exam photographic content that is extraoral, full-face, with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion, which is a record artifact. SCTID 1306624006 is the precise code because it matches these attributes exactly. A more general extraoral face photo would omit critical details, while siblings such as smiling or intraoral photos would miscode the artifact. The phrasing “exam photos” simply denotes context of capture and does not introduce new attributes, preserving code accuracy."
722175001,Psychosomatic medicine service (qualifier value),Psychosomatic medicine service following,"This text indicates that the psychosomatic medicine service is following the case, centering on the service identity. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 722175001 is the correct selection as it names the psychosomatic medicine service specifically. Procedure concepts like follow-up visits would not be appropriate because the entry is about the service type, not a particular clinical encounter. Parent and sibling service qualifiers are either too broad or represent different services than psychosomatic medicine."
761939000,Structure of distal epiphysis of left femur (body structure),Distal epiphysis of left femur,"The entry explicitly identifies the anatomical site as the distal epiphysis of the femur with left-sided laterality. This is a Body structure (Anatomical structure) and aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 761939000 “Structure of distal epiphysis of left femur.” It is more precise than the parent concepts like “Structure of distal epiphysis of femur” (no laterality) and avoids child or sibling structures (e.g., specific condyles or right side). The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not introduce any condition, procedure, or additional attributes."
1365870000,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror and corrected of right buccal segment with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),Intraoral mirror photo (orientation corrected) of right buccal segment with teeth in centric relation.,"This entry specifies an intraoral photographic image captured via a mirror, explicitly noting that the orientation has been corrected, and focuses on the right buccal segment with the teeth in centric relation. The main concept is a dental photographic record artifact with attributes: intraoral, mirror-viewed, corrected, right buccal segment, and centric relation. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 1365870000 is the most precise match because it encodes exactly this combination of view, correction, region, and occlusal position. Parent concepts lacking one of these attributes (e.g., not corrected or not specifying centric relation) would be too broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., left buccal segment, lingual segment, or non-mirror view) would misrepresent laterality or technique. The phrase “orientation corrected” is clinically equivalent to “corrected,” and “intraoral mirror photo” matches “photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror,” without adding or changing attributes."
223372009,French Polynesia (geographic location),Travel destination recorded: French Polynesia,"The entry identifies French Polynesia as a travel destination, but the entity to code is the geographic location itself. It belongs to the SNOMED CT category Geographic location (Location) and maps to SCTID 223372009. The wording avoids broader regions or specific islands, preventing misclassification to parent or child concepts. The travel context does not add attributes to the location, confirming French Polynesia (geographic location) as the correct code."
298791001,Passive range of shoulder extension (observable entity),Passive range of shoulder extension,"The entry explicitly names the observable of passive range of motion for shoulder extension. It targets the movement of extending the shoulder, assessed passively (the examiner moves the joint), without adding laterality, values, or clinical modifiers. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. This best matches 298791001 because it is specific to passive ROM of shoulder extension. Broader parents like passive range of shoulder movement are less precise, and siblings such as active shoulder extension ROM or passive shoulder flexion are not indicated by the wording."
1187154009,Structure of fourth lumbrical muscle of hand (body structure),Teaching note: fourth lumbrical muscle of the hand,"The phrase designates the fourth lumbrical muscle in the hand as the subject of a teaching note, which remains an anatomical reference only. Category: Body structure. The SNOMED CT concept 'Structure of fourth lumbrical muscle of hand' (SCTID 1187154009) is the precise match, because it encapsulates the ordinal and location. Parent concepts omit the 'fourth' detail, and sibling concepts describe different lumbricals. The teaching context does not alter or add attributes to the anatomical concept."
420340005,"Brachial pulse, function (observable entity)",Brachial pulse function data element,"Describing it as a data element emphasizes the documentation field for the function of the brachial pulse, which is exactly an Observable entity. This corresponds to SCTID 420340005. There are no result values or qualifiers, so it cannot be mapped to a finding or a procedure. Parent observables lacking site specificity would be too broad, and other arterial pulse sites are excluded. 'Data element' is a neutral synonym that keeps the observable’s semantics intact."
702217001,"Dental implant debridement brush, biodegradable (physical object)",Biodegradable brush for dental implant debridement,"The phrase describes a physical brush intended for debridement of dental implants and specifies biodegradability, matching the device concept 702217001. Category: Physical object. This is more precise than a parent without the biodegradable qualifier and is distinct from sibling devices such as general toothbrushes or implant brushes that are not biodegradable."
462936003,Psychiatric-therapy vagus nerve electrical stimulation system (physical object),Neurostimulation system targeting the vagus nerve for psychiatric therapy,"The entry describes a neurostimulation system targeting the vagus nerve, with psychiatric therapy as its intended use—clearly a Physical object (Device). The inclusion of therapy domain selects 462936003 rather than a general vagus nerve neurostimulator system (parent) or other indication-specific siblings. It avoids referencing procedural performance or individual components, maintaining focus on the complete system."
224926006,Inner city (environment),Inner-city region,"The phrase identifies a region classified as inner-city, maintaining a geographic/environmental meaning only. No cause, severity, timing, or clinical associations are included. The category is Environment or geographical location. Although 'region' might imply spatial extent, it still refers to the inner-city environment and does not warrant mapping to a parent or to non-inner city concepts. The best match remains 224926006."
170723004,Ophthalmological treatment changed (situation),Ocular therapy changed,"This communicates that therapy for the eyes has been changed, with no extra qualifiers. It is a Situation and matches 170723004 Ophthalmological treatment changed (situation). ‘Ocular’ is synonymous with ophthalmological regarding the care domain, and ‘therapy’ aligns with treatment. Parent concepts would be nonspecific, while child or sibling concepts that introduce type of change or modality (start/stop/medication) are not indicated by the wording."
5791000124105,Cephalometric stomion superius point (body structure),Reference: stomion superius point,"The entry succinctly names the stomion superius point as a reference, indicating the specific cephalometric anatomical landmark. Main concept: cephalometric stomion superius point. SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This aligns with SCTID 5791000124105, avoiding broader stomion or other lip points. The term 'reference' is a neutral descriptor that maintains equivalence and adds no attributes."
300083003,External ear finding (finding),External ear finding noted on exam,"This entry documents that an examination noted a clinical finding of the external ear, without specifying type, side, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 300083003 is the best match because the content centers on a finding of the external ear, and the exam context does not change the concept. Parent concepts (Ear finding) lack the external ear specificity, and children (pinna/canal findings or abnormalities) are not evidenced. The wording remains semantically equivalent to the concept."
2561005,Eastern kingbird (organism),Eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus),"The entry provides both the common and scientific names, clearly identifying the organism Eastern kingbird, category Organism, matching SCTID 2561005. The binomial Tyrannus tyrannus is the exact scientific designation for this species, confirming specificity. Parent taxa (genus Tyrannus, family Tyrannidae) are less specific, and sibling species (e.g., Western kingbird) would not match the stated binomial. Including both names does not add attributes; it reinforces the precise species code."
672281000119109,History of carcinosarcoma of uterus (situation),History of uterine carcinosarcoma.,"The entry explicitly states a past history of carcinosarcoma located in the uterus. The main concept is a prior diagnosis, which is a situation rather than an active disorder. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with a Situation concept, specifically “History of carcinosarcoma of uterus” (SCTID: 672281000119109). It does not introduce details such as stage, treatment, recurrence, or timing beyond the fact of history, and it specifies the exact morphology (carcinosarcoma) and site (uterus), making broader parent concepts like “History of malignant neoplasm of uterus” too general and child concepts (e.g., endometrial carcinosarcoma) too specific. The wording matches the concept precisely without adding attributes."
16216331000119107,Cerebrospinal fluid smear specimen (specimen),Diagnostic report lists: CSF smear specimen,"The diagnostic report enumerates a CSF smear specimen, directly aligning with the concept 'Cerebrospinal fluid smear specimen'. The main concept is the smear specimen derived from cerebrospinal fluid. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. No staining, analysis type, or condition is added, so child or sibling concepts are not implied. It is appropriately specific compared to the parent CSF specimen."
86656007,Salmonella Krefeld (organism),S. enterica serovar Krefeld,"This is a concise taxonomic synonym naming the same organism as Salmonella Krefeld. The main concept is the organism identity without clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 86656007 most precisely represents this serovar. Broader parents (species/subspecies) and sibling serovars would not match as precisely, and disorder codes would be inappropriate."
444231000124103,Lysine and tryptophan-free formula (product),Order: lysine/tryptophan-free formula,"This order statement indicates procurement/use of a formula lacking both lysine and tryptophan. The primary concept is the product itself; the context of “Order” does not alter the product attributes. Category: Product. It aligns exactly with Lysine and tryptophan-free formula (444231000124103). A parent like general formula is too nonspecific, and a sibling naming only one amino acid omission would be insufficient. The slash construction is a clinically standard synonym for “and” and does not change the intended code."
258432004,Sebum specimen (specimen),Specimen material: sebum,"The phrase explicitly identifies the specimen material as sebum. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and Sebum specimen (specimen), SCTID 258432004, matches exactly. The wording does not introduce collection methods, anatomical sites, or timing details that would alter coding. Parent concepts are too general, while sibling materials refer to different secretions or collection approaches. There are no qualifiers implying a more specific child concept."
102640000,Inosine (substance),Analyte name: inosine,"This identifies inosine as an analyte by name without discussing levels or measurements, which keeps the focus on the substance itself. In SNOMED CT, the best fit is the Substance concept Inosine (substance) [102640000]. Observable entities like “inosine level” or procedures would require measurement context, which is absent here, and parent or sibling substances are less specific."
728031006,Entire facet of subtalar joint (body structure),Documentation: subtalar joint facet identified,"This narrative documentation records identification of the subtalar joint facet, specifying the anatomical facet only. It is a Body structure and maps to SCTID 728031006. The entry does not introduce laterality, pathology, or subfacet designation and therefore avoids coding to parent or child concepts. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent paraphrase of the same structure."
466160002,Surgical mist irrigation tip (physical object),Packaging label reads: surgical mist irrigation tip,"A packaging label that names 'surgical mist irrigation tip' denotes the exact device component. Category: Physical object (device). The entry includes 'tip' and 'mist' in a surgical irrigation context, matching 466160002. It does not introduce unrelated attributes or alternate device types such as whole irrigators or non-mist variants."
701134001,Microdialysis system analyzer (physical object),Microdialysis analyzer unit (system),"Main concept: the analyzer unit of a microdialysis system. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). This phrasing explicitly ties the analyzer to the microdialysis system, which aligns with SCTID 701134001. Generic analyzers or other microdialysis devices would miscode the reference. The synonym is clinically equivalent and introduces no additional attributes."
77740007,Struck by falling tool (event),Patient reports being struck by a falling tool,"The statement clearly describes the person being struck by a tool that was falling, which is exactly 'Struck by falling tool (event)' SCTID 77740007. The main concept is an Event in SNOMED CT. It provides specificity beyond broader categories (falling object) and does not imply alternative mechanisms (e.g., thrown tool). The wording does not introduce injury details, body site, severity, or intent, keeping the code selection precise."
1351708006,Glaesserella parasuis serotype 10 (organism),Organism: Glaesserella parasuis serotype 10,"This entry highlights the organism field and names Glaesserella parasuis with serotype 10. The main concept is organism identification with an exact serotype attribute; it does not add clinical findings or host details. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The most precise code is Glaesserella parasuis serotype 10 (1351708006). A parent organism code without serotype would be less precise, and siblings for other serotypes would not match. The label 'Organism:' adds context but does not change the coding target."
215201000,"Animal-drawn vehicle accident involving collision between animal-drawn vehicle and animal, occupant of animal-drawn vehicle injured (event)",Occupant injured in collision between animal-drawn vehicle and animal,"The entry states an accident event where an animal-drawn vehicle collided with an animal and the injured party was an occupant of that vehicle. The main concepts are collision with an animal, animal-drawn vehicle, and injured occupant. SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 215201000 is the most precise match because it explicitly covers animal-drawn vehicle accidents involving collision with an animal and specifies the injured person as an occupant of the vehicle. Broader parents like generic transport accidents or animal-drawn vehicle accidents without collision are less specific, and siblings such as pedestrian injured, rider of animal injured, motor vehicle collisions, or non-collision events would be incorrect. The wording uses standard terms and does not add attributes beyond those inherent to the concept."
242912008,Assault with truncheon (event),Incident: assault with baton,"The entry identifies an assault event and specifies the instrument as a baton, a synonym for truncheon, with no added attributes like injuries or timing. It is an Event concept. Assault with truncheon (event) [242912008] best fits, as it explicitly codes assault with this instrument. More generic assault codes would be less precise, and the synonym does not affect code selection."
25200002,Sound wave (physical force),Pressure wave of sound,"This paraphrase specifies that the pressure wave pertains to sound, which is semantically equivalent to 'sound wave' as a physical force. It most precisely maps to SNOMED CT 'Sound wave (physical force)' (SCTID 25200002) in the Physical force category. The entry avoids additional attributes (e.g., loudness, frequency, cause, exposure) and thus does not warrant mapping to siblings/children like 'Noise' or 'Ultrasound'. The parent 'Physical force' would be less specific and therefore inferior to this exact match."
1204486002,Pitcairn (geographic location),Home location: Pitcairn,"Pitcairn is identified as the home location, expressing the place name in living context. The main concept remains the geographic location Pitcairn, SNOMED CT category Geographic location, SCTID 1204486002. The entry does not point to a distinct child like Pitcairn Island or to a differently named jurisdiction; thus the provided concept is the exact match."
215857000,"Hit by boat or part thereof after fall from boat, swimmer injured (event)","ED triage note: swimmer injured after fall from boat, struck by boat/part","The triage documentation indicates a swimmer who fell from a boat and was struck by the boat or its part, which satisfies the exact mechanism described. The main concept is the external cause event involving a fall from boat and subsequent hit by boat/part. Category: Event. It aligns precisely with SCTID 215857000, capturing both elements and the injured swimmer without adding body site or timing beyond the sequence. Broader parents or isolated mechanisms are incomplete; narrower children naming specific parts would be over-specified. 'Struck by boat/part' is synonymous with 'hit by boat or part thereof.'"
414099007,Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Serotype O126:H27 (organism),Bacterium: Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli O126:H27,"This is a bacterium designation, naming Escherichia coli with enteroaggregative pathotype and serotype O126:H27. It conveys only the organism identity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, precisely matching 414099007. Choosing a parent like Escherichia coli alone or EAEC without the serotype would lose specificity, and sibling pathotypes or serotypes would be wrong. The prefixed label 'Bacterium:' clarifies the biological category without adding clinical attributes."
768765001,Product containing chlorine and/or chlorine compound (product),Preparation containing chlorine or chlorine compound (product),"Using “preparation” within the product domain signals a formulated product that contains chlorine or a chlorine compound, without implying medicinal status or specific function. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This maps to SCTID 768765001 since the composition criterion is the presence of chlorine/ chlorine compounds. Selecting a child concept like “Sodium hypochlorite preparation (product)” would be overly specific and not warranted by the wording."
701944003,"Ventilator tester, line-powered (physical object)",Incoming inspection: ventilator tester (line-powered),"The entry documents a ventilator tester with the parenthetical attribute 'line-powered'. Category: Physical object. Including the line/mains power detail makes the specific code for a line-powered ventilator tester the best match, excluding a general ventilator tester concept and any battery-powered sibling. The inspection context is not an attribute of the device and does not affect the classification."
1187075004,Russian Federation (geographic location),Russian Federation — country-level location,"This states the country-level location as the Russian Federation without adding contextual attributes. It maps to Russian Federation (geographic location) [1187075004] within the Location hierarchy. Broader parent concepts are too general, and child or sibling locations are not implied. The phrase simply reinforces the granularity level, keeping the concept precise and equivalent to the preferred name."
430336008,Family history of color blindness (situation),Past family history: color blindness,"This denotes color blindness within the family history section, not a personal prior condition. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context; 430336008 is the most accurate code. It avoids subtype detail and relative specification, which would better fit child concepts, and is narrower than generic parents."
463972002,"Menstrual pad, unscented (physical object)",Inventory: menstrual pad (unscented),"This entry lists a menstrual pad with the qualifier unscented in an inventory context. The concept is a physical object; category Physical object. It maps to SCTID 463972002 because the object's scent attribute is explicit. A parent without the unscented detail would be less specific, and scented variants or non-pad products would be incorrect. The inventory label is contextual and does not introduce new attributes."
167875003,Ankle joint synovial fluid (specimen),Sample source: ankle joint synovial fluid,"This states the specimen source as synovial fluid from the ankle joint, which matches Ankle joint synovial fluid (specimen), SCTID 167875003. The SNOMED category is Specimen. No timing, severity, or laterality is introduced. Parent concepts lacking “ankle joint” are too general; siblings (e.g., knee synovial fluid) do not fit the source indicated here."
217438003,Accident due to fall from burning theater (event),"During a theater fire, the patient accidentally fell from the building","This narrative states a theater fire (‘burning’) and a fall ‘from the building,’ preserving the accidental event context. Category: Event. ‘During a theater fire’ and ‘fell from the building’ are paraphrases of ‘from burning theater,’ making it equivalent to SCTID 217438003. It is more specific than generic falls and does not introduce unnecessary substructure or timing details beyond the fire context."
1149144004,Contact with Epicauta vittata (event),Toxicology consult: Epicauta vittata exposure,"Within a toxicology consult context, the entry states exposure to Epicauta vittata without suggesting poisoning or effects, keeping it as a contact event. The main concept is contact/exposure to this species, which is an Event in SNOMED CT. 'Exposure' is an acceptable synonym for 'contact', making SCTID 1149144004 the correct, specific code. Concepts like toxic effect or cantharidin poisoning would be inappropriate because the entry does not describe an adverse outcome."
1237463001,International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework food level (observable entity),IDDSI food level documented,"Although this adds the documentation context, the concept is still the IDDSI food level observable. The added word 'documented' does not introduce a different concept; it simply indicates status in the record. This remains an Observable entity. Parent generic food texture observables do not carry the IDDSI specification, and the drink-level sibling is not relevant. No child concept is suggested because no exact level is reported."
417451006,Procedure needed (situation),Documentation: procedure required,"The statement records that a procedure is required, synonymous with 'needed,' without specifying type or schedule. Main concept: documented need for a procedure. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 417451006 is the correct mapping. Broader needs are not precise enough, and siblings indicating planning or completion are not appropriate. This remains a generic need, not a specific kind of procedure, thus avoiding child concepts."
122728001,Specimen from testis obtained by inguinal exposure with testicular isolation and biopsy (specimen),Histology specimen: testicular biopsy (inguinal exposure with isolation),"This histology specimen statement specifies a testicular biopsy sample acquired by inguinal exposure with testicular isolation, which matches the method requirements of the SNOMED specimen concept. It remains firmly in the Specimen category. More general biopsy specimen concepts lack the approach detail, and procedural concepts would be inappropriate. Parent/child/sibling distinctions are respected by retaining only the required attributes and avoiding any additions such as laterality or extent."
122183004,Bordetella pertussis antigen assay (procedure),Assay for Bordetella pertussis antigen,"This phrase clearly indicates a laboratory assay targeting Bordetella pertussis antigen, classified as a Procedure. It maps to Bordetella pertussis antigen assay (procedure), SCTID 122183004. The wording does not introduce timing, result, specimen, or method details, avoiding child or sibling concepts like rapid antigen variants, antibody testing, PCR, or culture, and is more specific than parent categories that lack organism detail."
174041007,Laparoscopic emergency appendectomy (procedure),Operative procedure: Laparoscopic emergency appendectomy,"The documentation style indicates the performed operation and specifies appendectomy via laparoscopy under emergency conditions, which is a Procedure mapped to SNOMED CT 174041007. Alternatives without the emergency qualifier or without specifying the laparoscopic approach would be less precise, so parent or sibling concepts are not appropriate. The entry does not add cause, laterality, or adjunct techniques (e.g., robotic assistance). The phrasing is a clear procedural statement equivalent to the preferred term."
18523001,Nudity (finding),Documented nudity,"The entry confirms nudity is documented, without adding attributes such as cause or context. Main concept: nudity; attributes: none. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. This aligns exactly with 18523001 (Nudity), and does not imply partial exposure or behavioral issues, avoiding misclassification to other concepts."
771082000,Acute medicine care plan (record artifact),Acute medicine care plan documented,"This entry conveys that an acute medicine care plan has been documented, emphasizing the record artifact rather than clinical actions. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps precisely to Acute medicine care plan (771082000). A more general care plan concept would omit the specialty modifier, and siblings like management plan or clinical note would misclassify the artifact. The term 'documented' reflects the recording status and does not add clinical attributes beyond the existence of the plan."
310203004,Pediatric Accident and Emergency department (environment),Pediatric ED (department),"This entry specifies the pediatric ED and explicitly indicates it is a department-level environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It best matches Pediatric Accident and Emergency department (environment) SCTID 310203004. A parent like ED (environment) lacks the pediatric qualifier, and siblings that denote events (ED visit) or organizations (ED service) would be inappropriate because the text is strictly a place. 'ED' is a widely used synonym for A&E/ER and does not change the coding intent."
6893006,First stage of labor (finding),Stage one of labor,"“Stage one of labor” plainly denotes the first stage of labor and does not introduce any additional qualifiers. As a Clinical finding, it corresponds to SCTID 6893006. It is more specific than a general labor finding and does not subdivide into latent or active phases, so child concepts are not implicated. The ordinal synonym is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
438064007,Genus Soehngenia (organism),Isolate classified as Soehngenia (genus),"The entry communicates classification of an isolate at the genus level, naming Soehngenia. No species, site, or disease markers are provided. The concept fits the Organism hierarchy and is best mapped to Genus Soehngenia (organism), SCTID 438064007. Broader organism categories lack the specificity implied by the genus name, while species-level children are too specific and not supported. The parenthetical rank '(genus)' serves as a clinically equivalent synonym for the genus concept without changing code selection."
769267001,After flossing (qualifier value),After flossing teeth,"The entry specifies 'after flossing teeth,' which is a descriptive way to express the same temporal qualifier value relative to flossing. It fits the Qualifier value category and maps directly to SCTID 769267001. Parents like generic 'after' or 'oral hygiene' are less precise, and siblings referring to different activities are inappropriate. The added 'teeth' clarifies the standard flossing target without altering the concept or adding attributes."
261360005,Charnley approach (qualifier value),Operative strategy: Charnley approach.,"The entry documents the operative strategy in terms of the approach “Charnley,” which maps to the Qualifier value Charnley approach (261360005). No body site, procedure, laterality, or modifications are introduced, preserving a pure approach qualifier. Parent concepts are overly broad and would reduce specificity; sibling approaches are not indicated. The phrase “operative strategy” serves contextual framing without changing the underlying concept, making this a clinically equivalent and precise reference to the Charnley approach."
1306625007,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Clinical record photo of right half of face in 45-degree extraoral view; lips at rest; jaws in centric relation.,"The text specifies a clinical record photo that is extraoral, showing the right half of the face in a 45-degree view, with lips at rest and jaws in centric relation. These match the concept exactly. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. 'Lips at rest' is equivalent to 'lips relaxed.' This would not map to a procedure code because it refers to a record. Parent/sibling concepts differing by laterality, angle, or jaw/lip state would be less accurate."
427562009,Blood in upper airway (finding),Blood noted in the upper airway,"The term 'noted' reflects observation of blood within the upper airway, consistent with a clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This exactly matches 427562009 because it records the presence of blood at that location without claiming etiology, severity, timing, or symptoms like cough. More general 'blood in airway' would omit the upper location, and disorder terms like epistaxis or upper respiratory tract hemorrhage would imply ongoing bleeding, which is not stated."
81257009,"Extremity testing for strength, dexterity or stamina (procedure)","Limb strength, dexterity, and stamina test administered","This entry states that a test was administered to assess limb (extremity) strength, dexterity, and stamina, which is procedural. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It aligns with SCTID 81257009 because it clearly specifies extremity testing and includes all three attributes, avoiding laterality, specific named tests, or results. Parent concepts are broader and less specific, while children/siblings like upper-limb strength tests or finger dexterity assessments are narrower and not as appropriate. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent variation of the preferred term."
216429008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, prison (environment)",Injury sustained inside the prison,"The entry indicates that an injury (an accident context) took place inside a prison, specifying the environmental site and no further clinical attributes. This maps to SNOMED CT “Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, prison (environment)” (216429008). Category: Environment. It is more precise than the general place-of-occurrence parent, and does not suggest any sibling environment. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase specifying the same setting without broadening or narrowing the scope."
1222758004,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I:19 (qualifier value),Histopathology addendum: AJCC Stage I.,"While the context references a histopathology addendum, the entry itself only specifies AJCC Stage I and does not state pathologic versus clinical staging or any substage/site. The concept is a Qualifier value matching American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I:19, SCTID 1222758004. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling/child concepts (Stage II, IA) are not indicated. The context does not alter the staging value being coded."
184882003,Disabled registration application - full report (record artifact),Review notes: full report of disabled registration application present,"This entry confirms the presence of the full report pertaining to a disabled registration application in a review context. The category is Record artifact. The review note context is incidental and doesn’t change the artifact’s identity, making SCTID 184882003 the exact fit and avoiding broader or summary report mappings."
302102002,Lower back hair score (observable entity),Hair score—lower back region,"The concept here is the hair score limited to the lower back region. It is an Observable entity and matches SCTID 302102002, which defines the observable for the lower back hair score. The hyphenated phrasing does not alter the meaning or introduce new attributes. The wording excludes other anatomical areas, so sibling concepts (e.g., chest hair score, upper back hair score) are not applicable, and a parent concept (generic hair score) would be too nonspecific."
305529006,Under care of cardiac surgeon (finding),Patient under cardiac surgeon’s care,"This clearly denotes that the patient’s care is provided by a cardiac surgeon, which maps precisely to “Under care of cardiac surgeon (finding).” The main concept is the care relationship and provider type; no condition details or timing attributes are included. It is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT. Broader parent categories would be overly generic, and sibling concepts for other specialists would be incorrect. The phrasing is a straightforward restatement of the same finding and thus matches SCTID 305529006 most accurately."
217198006,"Fumes from combustion of polyvinylchloride and similar material in conflagration, in lodging house (event)",PVC-and-similar-material combustion fumes noted in lodging house conflagration,"This phrasing notes combustion fumes from PVC and similar material within a lodging house conflagration, including material, event type, and location. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It aligns precisely with SCTID 217198006. Parent concepts that generalize the fumes or setting and sibling concepts involving different locations or materials would not be as precise. The hyphenated phrase is stylistic and retains the same clinical meaning without adding attributes."
1356758000,Union for International Cancer Control cN1(sn) (qualifier value),Impression: UICC cN1(sn) category,"The impression documents the UICC TNM clinical nodal category cN1 with sentinel node notation (sn). It is a Qualifier value that maps to SNOMED CT 'Union for International Cancer Control cN1(sn) (qualifier value)' (SCTID 1356758000). The wording avoids site or pathological details, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate. 'Category' is a synonym for the nodal staging qualifier and does not change coding."
705083008,Sensation of irritation of eye proper (finding),Eye irritation noted in ROS,"Documenting eye irritation in the review of systems indicates a patient-experienced symptom, not an objective sign, with no expansion into cause, laterality, or timing. This is a Clinical finding best captured by Sensation of irritation of eye proper (finding), SCTID 705083008. Choosing parent concepts (e.g., eye symptom) would be overly broad, and siblings like eye pain, pruritus, or foreign body sensation would incorrectly shift the symptom quality. The ROS context clarifies the subjective nature while preserving the precise meaning of eye irritation."
281137000,Entire carotid sinus (body structure),Complete carotid sinus anatomy,"This entry designates the complete carotid sinus as an anatomical entity. The key concept is the entire carotid sinus, and no other attributes are introduced. Category: Body structure. The best match is SCTID 281137000, which represents the entire carotid sinus. More general parents (e.g., carotid artery) or siblings (left/right carotid sinus, carotid body) do not match the specific anatomy and completeness given here. 'Complete' is a clinically equivalent descriptor to 'entire.'"
13912007,High voltage electricity (physical force),Physical force: high voltage electricity,"By labeling it explicitly as a physical force and naming high voltage electricity, the statement maps directly to SNOMED CT 13912007 (Physical force). No attributes related to exposure, injury, or circumstance are included, so situation or disorder hierarchies are not relevant. The specificity of 'high voltage' makes it more precise than the parent Electricity (physical force) and distinct from siblings such as Low voltage electricity. The colon usage is documentation style and does not alter the concept, keeping the same code."
244172000,Skin structure of posterolateral surface of thigh (body structure),Skin overlying the posterolateral surface of the thigh,"“Overlying” indicates the skin covering the specified surface, here the posterolateral thigh, which corresponds exactly to SCTID 244172000 under Body structure. More general parents lack the posterolateral localization, and siblings tied to either posterior or lateral alone fail to capture the combined region. The term remains within skin, not layer-specific (epidermis/dermis), and introduces no clinical attributes, maintaining accurate mapping."
466109003,"Tympanostomy tube, semi-permeable membrane (physical object)",Patient reports a semi-permeable membrane tympanostomy tube,"This patient-reported context still centers on the device type and design feature: a tympanostomy tube with a semi-permeable membrane. The main concept is a device under Physical object (Device). The wording does not introduce laterality, in situ status, or timing for coding; it simply names the device class. The semi-permeable attribute necessitates the specific SCTID 466109003 rather than a generic tympanostomy tube concept."
76104008,Not confirmed by (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value),Follow-up note: not confirmed by,"The follow-up note heading provides context, but the coded concept remains the qualifier “not confirmed by.” There is no specification of what it is not confirmed by, maintaining generality. This is a Qualifier value and maps to SCTID 76104008. More specific child qualifiers that cite a confirming method would be inappropriate, and sibling/parent concepts like “confirmed by” or “not confirmed” (without ‘by’) would not be as exact."
14035003,Death by hanging (event),Death secondary to hanging,"This formulation conveys that the death was secondary to hanging, i.e., caused by hanging, which is an Event. It is a clinically equivalent paraphrase for death by hanging and matches SCTID 14035003. The phrase does not introduce intent or other contextual attributes, so it remains at the general level rather than a child concept. It is more precise than generic death, justifying this code."
429023001,History of Ewings sarcoma (situation),History of Ewing's tumor,"‘Ewing’s tumor’ is a clinically accepted synonym for Ewing sarcoma, and the entry clearly expresses a personal past history without asserting current disease or adding other attributes. This maps to the SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context concept History of Ewings sarcoma (429023001). Coding to the active disorder would be incorrect; choosing a general history-of-neoplasm parent is too broad; and family-history siblings are not applicable. The synonym does not introduce new clinical details."
112298009,Salmonella Cochin (organism),Organism identified: Salmonella Cochin,"This documentation line names the identified organism without adding site, disease, or test result details beyond the identity itself. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. While 'identified' is contextual, the coded content remains the organism’s taxon; it does not warrant a finding or infection code. Parent Salmonella concepts are too general and sibling serovars are different organisms, so Salmonella Cochin (organism) is the precise mapping."
368337008,Entire base of phalanx of ring finger (body structure),History note: entire base of ring finger phalanx,"Within a history note, this line records the anatomical reference as the entire base of a ring finger phalanx, avoiding laterality and phalanx-level specification. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 368337008 is the best fit, denoting the complete base of a ring finger phalanx. Parents lacking the ‘entire’ qualifier and children specifying proximal/middle/distal phalanx are less appropriate for this wording. The context label does not introduce new attributes or change coding."
244598002,Entire ligamentum flavum (body structure),Complete ligamentum flavum,"The concept expressed is the ligamentum flavum in its complete form, with no segmental limitation or added findings. This belongs to the Body structure hierarchy and aligns with Entire ligamentum flavum (SCTID 244598002). Parent concepts would be too broad, and children specifying particular spinal regions or partial structures would be too narrow. 'Complete' is used as a clinically safe equivalent to 'entire' and does not change coding."
315302009,Reconstruction of maxilla with flap (procedure),Procedure: flap reconstruction of maxilla,"This entry labels the intervention as a flap reconstruction of the maxilla, which is semantically equivalent to “Reconstruction of maxilla with flap,” mapping to SCTID 315302009. Main concepts: maxilla and use of a flap in reconstruction. Category: Procedure. The flap attribute ensures specificity beyond the parent reconstruction concept, and absence of subtype or indication avoids child/sibling concepts. The paraphrase does not alter the clinical meaning."
868198000,Suborder Cornidovirineae (organism),Taxon rank (suborder): Cornidovirineae,"This explicitly states the taxon rank as suborder and names Cornidovirineae, leaving no ambiguity about the organism's classification level. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It aligns with SCTID 868198000 and does not add any clinical context, so mapping to parent (order) or child (family/species) concepts would be inappropriate."
358249008,Sodium bicarbonate hemodialysis dry concentrate cartridge (product),Maintenance note: sodium bicarbonate dry concentrate cartridge (hemodialysis),"This maintenance context identifies the product as a sodium bicarbonate dry concentrate cartridge for hemodialysis. Attributes are clearly ingredient (sodium bicarbonate), indication (hemodialysis), formulation (dry concentrate), and packaging (cartridge). SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 358249008 exactly corresponds to this item. Broader dialysis bicarbonate concentrate concepts without cartridge form and sibling products like liquid concentrate or powder bags are less appropriate. The maintenance note framing does not change the product identity or introduce additional attributes."
387996004,Allium sativum specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Garlic IgE (specific),"The phrase indicates IgE that is specific to garlic; the parenthetical clarifies specificity without implying a result or procedure. This is a Substance and aligns with SNOMED CT 387996004. Coding to a general IgE or to a different allergen would be less precise, and a disorder like garlic allergy would misrepresent the concept. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent to “Allium sativum-specific immunoglobulin E.”"
411663000,Citrus paradisi diagnostic allergen extract (product),Citrus paradisi diagnostic allergen reagent (allergen extract),"This entry clarifies it is a diagnostic allergen reagent and explicitly denotes it as an allergen extract from Citrus paradisi, pointing to the diagnostic product. Category: Product. SCTID 411663000 best fits. Parent concepts lacking species or reagent type are too general; siblings for other species or therapeutic extracts would be incorrect. The term “reagent” is a standard synonym in laboratory context for a diagnostic extract and does not alter the underlying product concept."
264349002,Cerebral function analyzing monitor (physical object),Supplies/equipment list entry: cerebral function analysing monitor equipment,"The phrase identifies the monitor as 'equipment', which is a neutral category term, while keeping specificity to the cerebral function analysing monitor. The concept is a physical device. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). The best code is 264349002. General monitoring equipment or siblings representing different modalities would be less precise. The list context does not add attributes that would change coding."
399000008,Mayer projection (qualifier value),Mayer’s projection,"The possessive form “Mayer’s projection” is a conventional variant naming the same specific radiographic projection, not altering clinical meaning or adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The exact code Mayer projection (399000008) is the best fit; broader parent qualifiers or different named projections would be less appropriate because the entry explicitly identifies the Mayer projection."
214560008,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving being accidentally pushed from motor vehicle while in motion, driver of motor vehicle injured (event)",History: injury to driver after accidental push from a motor vehicle in motion during a noncollision traffic accident.,"This history note conveys the mechanism (accidental push from a moving motor vehicle), driver injury, and noncollision traffic accident context, which together match SCTID 214560008. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Parent or sibling concepts lacking either the noncollision detail or the push mechanism would be inappropriate. The wording is equivalent to the preferred term and remains attribute-neutral beyond the defined concept."
223523003,Chad (geographic location),Country designation: Chad,"This frames Chad as a designated country name, consistent with the concept of a sovereign geographic location. Main concept: Chad. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The descriptor 'designation' does not change the underlying concept; SCTID 223523003 is the precise match."
1172622001,Victim of incest (finding),Incest survivor,"“Survivor” is commonly used interchangeably with “victim” in clinical documentation to indicate a person who has experienced a particular form of abuse; here, incest. It conveys the same Clinical finding as SNOMED CT 1172622001 without adding explicit timing or severity. It is more specific than parent concepts for sexual abuse because it identifies the familial nature of the abuse, and it does not shift to sibling concepts like rape or domestic violence. Thus, the precise code is “Victim of incest (finding).”"
257618005,Golf course (environment),Environment: golf course,"Here, the environment is explicitly identified as a golf course, which is a place descriptor. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The best match is Golf course (environment), SCTID 257618005. The entry does not imply other sports facilities or specific course components (green/fairway), so siblings or children are not indicated. The context label 'Environment' is consistent with coding the location concept only."
59432006,"Ligature, device (physical object)",Supplies entry: ligature device,"Framed as a supplies entry, the text still names the object—a ligature device—matching SNOMED CT 59432006 in the Physical object (Device) hierarchy. No additional attributes (e.g., absorbability, size, location) are implied. Broader device concepts would be non-specific, and siblings like bands or clips represent different devices. It does not describe ligation as a procedure, maintaining correct device coding."
311895002,Via cranial fossa (qualifier value),Surgical approach: via cranial fossa,"The phrase explicitly frames the qualifier as a surgical approach and identifies the route as via the cranial fossa, with no added details like sub-region or technique. In SNOMED CT, 'Via cranial fossa (qualifier value)' is the appropriate category and code because it denotes the route modifier used in procedure descriptions. More general parent qualifiers lack the anatomical specificity, while specifying anterior/middle/posterior cranial fossa would be child concepts not supported by the text. The addition of 'Surgical approach:' does not change the meaning; it preserves the qualifier value indicating the route via cranial fossa."
699291010000109,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Chenopodium album (substance),Anti–Chenopodium album IgG,"The entry uses the conventional “anti–” prefix to indicate an antibody directed against Chenopodium album, and it explicitly specifies IgG. This denotes a Substance in SNOMED CT and maps most precisely to “Immunoglobulin G antibody to Chenopodium album” (699291010000109). Parent classes like generic immunoglobulins or non-specific anti-plant antibodies are too broad, while siblings such as anti–Chenopodium album IgE or antibodies to other species differ in immunoglobulin class or antigen. No procedure, measurement, or clinical finding is stated."
710754009,Family education about fall prevention (situation),Family instructed regarding fall prevention,"This entry describes instruction (equivalent to education) given to the family on the topic of fall prevention. The main concept is family-targeted educational activity about preventing falls, which fits SNOMED CT 710754009 Family education about fall prevention (situation) in the Situation category. Parent concepts lacking the family audience specification are less precise, and alternatives such as Patient education about fall prevention or Caregiver education would not match the stated family audience. “Instructed” functions as an education synonym without adding extra attributes."
429763009,History of total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (situation),OB/GYN note: patient has history of total hysterectomy with bilateral removal of ovaries and tubes,"This note describes a past surgical history with the total hysterectomy and bilateral removal of ovaries and tubes (i.e., bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). It is a SNOMED CT Situation; code 429763009 captures the exact combination. Coding to broader “history of hysterectomy” or “history of oophorectomy” would be incomplete, and coding to a procedure concept would be inappropriate given the historical context. The wording uses synonymous terms to BSO without introducing route or cause."
463190000,Ophthalmic curette (physical object),Ophthalmic curette selected for case,"Selection for a case is contextual; the underlying concept is the ophthalmic curette device. This is a Physical object and maps precisely to Ophthalmic curette (463190000). The entry does not imply any narrower subtype (e.g., chalazion) or alternative instrument, so parent or sibling concepts are less accurate than this exact code."
411825005,Helminthosporium halodes diagnostic allergen extract (product),Helminthosporium halodes diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry names the specific diagnostic allergen extract derived from Helminthosporium halodes, which is precisely the product concept SCTID 411825005. The explicit attributes are the source organism (Helminthosporium halodes) and diagnostic use (allergen extract for testing). In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Product hierarchy (pharmaceutical/biologic product, allergen extract). A generic parent like “Allergen extract (product)” lacks the organism specificity, and siblings such as other species’ allergen extracts or therapeutic (immunotherapy) extracts do not fit the diagnostic intent. The wording matches the fully specified name without adding dose, route, or timing, ensuring this is the most precise code."
721914005,Patient consent document (record artifact),Patient consent documentation artifact,"The wording highlights that the documentation of patient consent is an artifact of the health record, focusing strictly on the document. Attributes like timing or consent status are not introduced. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact best matched to 721914005 Patient consent document (record artifact). Broader artifact concepts are less specific, and sibling concepts representing consent states or procedures would be inappropriate because the entry names the document itself. The synonym 'documentation artifact' remains semantically equivalent."
121501000146102,Enclosure bed (physical object),Supply item: enclosure bed,"This identifies a supply/equipment item as an enclosure bed, referencing the device itself. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It corresponds to Enclosure bed (physical object) [121501000146102] and not to an accessory or unrelated bed type. Supply context does not introduce added attributes (purpose, patient age, restraint), and the wording maintains equivalence to the standard term, making the enclosure bed concept the precise match."
464628008,Mortuary rack (physical object),Morgue cadaver storage rack,"The entry specifies a cadaver storage rack located in a morgue, which aligns with the Mortuary rack concept. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 464628008 fits because it targets the mortuary rack and not broader rack objects. Sibling concepts like “refrigerated mortuary unit” or “mortuary trolley” would be incorrect. The terms “morgue” and “cadaver” are contextual synonyms and do not introduce new attributes that alter code selection."
720355007,Testosterone bound to albumin (substance),Testosterone bound to albumin protein,"This wording identifies testosterone bound to the protein albumin, with no added attributes such as concentration, abnormality, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 720355007 correctly captures the specific bound form; a parent like testosterone lacks binding detail, and sibling entries like SHBG-bound or free testosterone refer to different states. Adding “protein” clarifies albumin’s nature but does not change the underlying concept, remaining clinically equivalent."
286168002,Does clean toilet (finding),"Patient statement: ""I clean the toilet.""","A direct patient quote expresses that they clean the toilet, equivalent to the finding ‘does clean toilet.’ The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding and aligns with SCTID 286168002. The quotation provides context without adding attributes such as frequency or level of help. General housekeeping parents lack specificity, and alternative objects or negations are not indicated. The synonymous wording preserves the same code selection."
702824005,Audiology clinic (environment),Care setting: audiology clinic,"This entry designates the care setting as an audiology clinic, pointing to the environment rather than a procedure or organization. It aligns with SNOMED CT Audiology clinic (environment), SCTID 702824005, under the Environment hierarchy. Using a parent like Healthcare facility (environment) would be too broad, and siblings like Outpatient clinic (environment) introduce outpatient attributes not stated here. 'Care setting' serves as documentation context without changing the concept, keeping the environment code most appropriate."
285653008,Mechanical force (physical force),Mechanical force noted by provider,"Provider notation does not change the underlying concept, which is a mechanical physical force. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It maps to 285653008, avoiding broader Physical force and excluding narrower or different-type siblings (e.g., electrical or gravitational forces)."
312080000,Air and water pressure (physical force),Patient-reported: air and water pressure,"Despite the patient-reported context, the entry names the physical force itself: air and water pressure. Category: Physical force. It maps to 312080000 because the concept is the combined pressure of air and water; parent or single-medium child concepts would not reflect both elements."
284659001,Temple - place of worship (environment),Location: temple,"The concept is a location specified as a temple, an environmental context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. This maps to Temple - place of worship (environment), SCTID 284659001, because it names the specific worship environment. It avoids added attributes such as denomination, timing, or sub-sites, making parent generic location/worship concepts less accurate and excluding sibling worship settings."
386860005,Etodolac (substance),Etodolac compound,"Calling etodolac a compound identifies it as a chemical substance, not a product, dose, or action. The main concept is etodolac. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The correct code is Etodolac (substance) SCTID 386860005. More general class concepts (NSAID) would lose specificity, and medicinal product siblings would introduce formulation attributes absent from this entry."
412597002,Camphor + eucalyptus + menthol (product),Camphor + eucalyptus + menthol combo medication,"The term ""combo medication"" denotes a combination medicinal product, and the listed actives are camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol; the main concept is the tri-ingredient product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This corresponds precisely to SCTID 412597002, which captures this combination without specifying formulation attributes. Parents are broader and less specific, children like ointments or inhalers with strengths are not supported by the text, and siblings that change the ingredient set are mismatched. The synonymic phrasing does not introduce any new clinical attributes."
404821007,Psychiatric intensive care unit (environment),Mental health intensive care unit,"The phrase uses “mental health” as a clinically acceptable synonym for psychiatry and clearly indicates an intensive care unit in that specialty as a place of care. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location and the best code is 404821007 Psychiatric intensive care unit (environment). It is not a general psychiatric ward nor a non-psychiatric ICU, and it introduces no extra attributes; thus parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate."
242299005,Accidental ingestion of food contaminant (event),Nursing documentation: accidental ingestion of food contaminant,"This documentation entry records the event of accidental ingestion of a food contaminant without elaborating on type, severity, or outcome. The main concept remains accidental ingestion of food contaminant; SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242299005 is the precise match. Child concepts such as ingestion of specific foreign bodies or toxins and sibling concepts like intentional ingestion are excluded by the wording."
215960006,Aircraft explosion-landing - parachutist injured (event),Indication for imaging: parachutist injured by aircraft explosion while landing.,"The imaging indication states a parachutist injured by an aircraft explosion occurring during landing, an Event. This matches SCTID 215960006, capturing the mechanism (explosion), phase (landing), and injured role (parachutist). Sibling concepts that involve crashes without explosion or different flight phases are excluded by the wording. Using 'while landing' is equivalent to 'during landing' and does not alter the concept."
217817004,Accidental mechanical suffocation in cot (event),Chart problem list: accidental mechanical suffocation in cot,Placing the phrase in a problem list context still denotes the same event: accidental mechanical suffocation in a cot. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 217817004 exactly captures accidental mechanical suffocation in cot. Parent concepts are broader and lack the cot qualifier; sibling concepts cover other locations or mechanisms. The entry maintains semantic equivalence without introducing any new attributes beyond accidental and mechanical in-cot suffocation.
258580003,Whole blood specimen (specimen),Whole blood specimen,"The main concept is a specimen consisting of whole blood. No collection route, anticoagulant, processing, or condition is stated. In SNOMED CT, this is a Specimen category concept, best matched to Whole blood specimen (specimen) 258580003. The broader parent such as Blood specimen would be imprecise because it can include processed derivatives (serum, plasma), while siblings like Serum specimen or Plasma specimen would be incorrect due to processing not indicated. More specific children like Venous whole blood specimen or Capillary whole blood specimen are not warranted because collection source is not specified."
270987006,Serum pyridoxine measurement (procedure),Serum vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) assay,"The entry describes an assay measuring pyridoxine (vitamin B6) in serum, which is a laboratory measurement procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps directly to Serum pyridoxine measurement (270987006), with “assay” serving as a common synonym for measurement that does not add method, timing, or result attributes. It excludes parent concepts without specimen specification and sibling concepts targeting plasma, whole blood, or different analytes like PLP."
224698001,Workshop (environment),The workshop,"Referencing 'the workshop' points to a physical workshop environment, appropriately coded as Workshop (environment) [224698001], an Environment concept. There are no additional descriptive qualifiers (e.g., industrial, automotive) and no event/temporal attributes. It clearly distinguishes from an educational 'workshop' event, ensuring the environmental concept is selected."
109064002,Hydrocortisone sodium phosphate (substance),Hydrocortisone sodium phosphate,"The entry explicitly names the substance hydrocortisone sodium phosphate, which is the corticosteroid hydrocortisone in its phosphate ester sodium salt form. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This matches SCTID 109064002 precisely because it denotes the specific chemical entity without route, dose, or product information. Broader parent concepts such as Hydrocortisone (substance) or Cortisol (substance) would be less specific, and sibling concepts like Hydrocortisone sodium succinate (substance) or medicinal product concepts containing hydrocortisone sodium phosphate introduce formulation or different salt attributes not present here."
242630004,Bite of turtle (event),Nursing note: bitten by turtle,"Nursing documentation states an event of being bitten by a turtle without adding site, severity, timing, or other qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This maps directly to SCTID 242630004 Bite of turtle (event). Choosing a parent like Animal bite (event) or a disorder such as injury due to turtle bite would be less precise or semantically different than the stated event."
1365746009,Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants - Shortened Version score (observable entity),REAP-S total score,"‘Total score’ indicates the overall summary value produced by REAP-S (as opposed to subscale or item scores), which aligns with the intended observable score entity. This remains specific to the shortened version and avoids mapping to generic assessment scores or the full REAP instrument. The wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not add interpretation, maintaining precise code selection."
1333897003,Prone fine needle aspiration biopsy and core needle biopsy of right breast using stereotactic plain X-ray guidance (procedure),Right-sided breast: prone stereotactic X-ray-guided fine-needle aspiration plus core needle biopsy,"The entry describes a Procedure for the right breast involving both fine-needle aspiration and core needle biopsy, performed with stereotactic X-ray guidance in the prone position. SCTID 1333897003 is the most precise code because it incorporates the dual biopsy techniques, right laterality, prone positioning, and stereotactic plain X-ray modality. Parent or sibling concepts that alter any of these components—such as laterality, position, modality, or number of biopsy types—are less appropriate. 'Right-sided breast' is synonymous with 'right breast' and maintains the intended coding."
125576007,Ionizing radiation (physical force),History entry: ionizing radiation,"Although placed in a history note context, the entry articulates only the concept 'ionizing radiation' without stating exposure or any event attributes. It belongs to the Physical force category. The exact code is 125576007. More general parents are not precise enough; child modalities or non-ionizing siblings are not indicated and would be incorrect."
277136005,Motor vehicle on road in collision with bollard (event),ED triage: motor vehicle on road collision with bollard,"In an ED triage context, this records a motor vehicle collision with a bollard that occurred on the road. Main concept: collision event; attributes: motor vehicle, road, bollard. SNOMED CT category: Event. The contextual prefix does not change the event semantics. Using broader transport accident codes would omit the bollard specificity; siblings naming other objects would miscode. No extra attributes (e.g., injury, timing) are added, so SCTID 277136005 is the appropriate precise code."
77942007,Integrin leukocyte adhesive protein (substance),Leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin,"The phrase uses the standard synonym “leukocyte function-associated antigen-1” and clarifies it is an integrin, referring to the LFA-1 heterodimer. The main concept is the molecule LFA-1, expressed as a substance with no clinical attributes added. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This maps most precisely to SCTID 77942007 because LFA-1 is the recognized name of the integrin leukocyte adhesive protein. Broader parent concepts like “beta-2 integrins” or sibling integrins (e.g., CD11b/CD18) do not match the specified antigen-1 identity."
21256006,Human leukocyte antigen Dw23 (substance),"HLA-Dw23 antigen, substance identifier","Labeling HLA-Dw23 antigen as a substance identifier continues to denote the specific antigen substance, corresponding to SNOMED CT 21256006 (Substance). The phrasing avoids any implication of clinical findings or test results, so it should not map to Clinical finding or Procedure concepts. More general parents are insufficiently specific, and siblings represent different antigens. The synonym 'antigen' is clinically equivalent and does not introduce new attributes."
411422003,Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium allergen patch test product (product),Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium patch testing allergen product,"This phrase identifies a product used for patch testing and specifies Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, classifying it as a SNOMED CT Product. It avoids introducing result, dose, or form. SCTID 411422003 is the correct code because it is the designated allergen patch test product for this species; a parent concept lacks specificity, and siblings would indicate different allergens. The wording is a clear synonym for the preferred term without altering the concept."
414485004,Induction room (environment),Imaging context: induction room,"This indicates the imaging context includes the induction room as the location, identifying an environment. The SNOMED CT match is Induction room (environment) [414485004] within Environment or geographical location. More general parent locations are nonspecific, and sibling environments like Operating room or PACU are different sites. The “Imaging context” label is non-clinical metadata and does not change or add attributes to the core concept."
217282005,Accident due to fall from burning tenement (event),Event description: accident due to fall from tenement while on fire.,"The description maintains the accident and fall language, with the tenement identified as on fire (synonymous with burning). SNOMED CT category: Event. Using “on fire” does not alter semantics, ensuring accurate mapping to SCTID 217282005, and it avoids parent/sibling concepts that either omit tenement or the burning attribute."
223859000,Regions of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (geographic location),Geographic region in the UK,"The phrase designates a geographic region located in the UK, aligning with SNOMED CT concept 223859000. Category: Geographic location. It neither maps to the entire United Kingdom (parent) nor to any specific named region (child). ‘Geographic region’ is a synonym that clarifies the nature of the concept without changing its scope or adding attributes."
1287277002,Structure of posterior ramus of fifth thoracic spinal nerve (body structure),Body structure: T5 posterior primary ramus of spinal nerve,"The wording identifies the anatomical entity as the posterior primary (dorsal) ramus of the T5 spinal nerve, with 'Body structure' serving as contextual framing. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This is clinically equivalent to 'posterior ramus' and maps to SCTID 1287277002. More general parents or alternative-level siblings are excluded, and no child-level branching is mentioned."
284507002,Predictability of behavior (observable entity),Predictability of behavior queried on intake,"The entry signals that the intake process queried the observable ‘predictability of behavior.’ No value, severity, or cause is introduced, keeping it within the Observable entity category and matching SCTID 284507002. The intake context does not alter the concept; choosing a procedure or a finding code would be inappropriate."
215525007,"Crushed by lifeboat after abandoning ship, water skier injured (event)",Recreation context: water skier injured by lifeboat crush after ship evacuation,"The entry maintains the full specificity: the injured person is a water skier, the mechanism is crush by a lifeboat, and the timing is after ship evacuation (equivalent to abandoning ship). The SNOMED CT category is Event. The ‘recreation context’ header does not change the coded meaning. This corresponds precisely to SCTID 215525007, whereas general recreational accidents or unspecified boating crush events would not include all the necessary qualifiers."
179789009,Revision augmentation of extra-articular ligament using prosthetic ligament (procedure),Revision augmentation of extra-articular ligament reinforced with synthetic ligament,"“Reinforced with synthetic ligament” expresses augmentation using a prosthetic ligament, with synthetic being a synonym for prosthetic. The wording includes revision and extra-articular ligament, matching SCTID 179789009. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Parent concepts without revision or device detail are broader, and sibling concepts like intra-articular augmentation or reconstruction would misrepresent the specified extra-articular augmentation using a prosthetic ligament."
286339005,Unable to produce appropriate voice volume (finding),ENT assessment: cannot regulate vocal loudness appropriately,"The entry describes inability to regulate vocal loudness appropriately, which is synonymous with the inability to produce appropriate voice volume. This is a Clinical finding. It does not specify increased or decreased loudness, avoiding hypophonia/hyperphonia, nor does it introduce causation. 'Vocal loudness' is a clinically equivalent term to 'voice volume,' supporting the same concept selection."
239005,Ophthalmologic (qualifier value),Subdomain: ophthalmologic,"“Ophthalmologic” is used here to denote a subdomain label, serving purely as an adjectival qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and “Ophthalmologic (qualifier value)” [239005] is the exact match. Concepts involving ophthalmic procedures, diagnoses, or specialties would introduce actions or roles not contained in this subdomain designation."
1304228002,Gamma valerolactone (substance),Substance identified: gamma-valerolactone,"The entry indicates identification of a substance and names gamma-valerolactone, without adding attributes like concentration, timing, or biological context. It remains a pure substance reference. SNOMED CT category is Substance. The specific code Gamma valerolactone (substance) [1304228002] best matches the wording. Broader parent classes or sibling compounds would not capture the exact chemical specified. The context of identification is neutral and does not change the semantic target from the substance."
309930002,Clinical cytogenetics department (environment),Seen in the clinical cytogenetics department,"This documents that the encounter occurred within the clinical cytogenetics department, an environment/location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The department is the focal concept, mapping directly to SCTID 309930002. It does not imply a different unit (e.g., laboratory or clinic) and so parent/sibling concepts would be less accurate."
370541008,Medication dispensed in error (event),Incorrect dispensing of medication,"‘Incorrect dispensing’ signals that the error happened during the dispensing process. This is best captured by SNOMED CT 370541008 (Event) for medication dispensed in error. No details suggest a particular subtype (e.g., dose or patient mismatch), so child concepts are not preferred. Using a parent medication error would remove the important dispensing stage specificity, and administration/prescribing siblings are inconsistent with the text."
116101001,Product containing gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor antagonist (product),Pharmacy formulary product containing a GnRH receptor antagonist,"This indicates a formulary-listed pharmaceutical product whose pharmacologic class is GnRH receptor antagonist. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The formulary context does not change the clinical concept; it remains a product containing a GnRH receptor antagonist, aligning with 116101001. It avoids specifying route, brand, or strength, so children are unnecessary. A broader parent concept would lose the class specificity, and substance-level siblings are incorrect because this is explicitly a product."
88534007,Mansonia (organism),Laboratory taxonomy entry: Mansonia,"This denotes the organism Mansonia as a taxonomy entry, which is the mosquito genus. The correct SNOMED CT Organism code is 88534007. The laboratory context does not introduce detection status, disease association, or species detail; it only frames the same organism concept. Parents like Culicidae or Diptera are overly broad; specific Mansonia species would be too narrow. The synonym preserves the genus-level meaning."
736801001,Length of ramus on right side of mandible (observable entity),Craniofacial morphometric: right mandibular ramus length,"The concept here is the measurable morphometric parameter of right-sided mandibular ramus length. This is an Observable entity describing anatomical length on a specific side. SCTID 736801001 is the precise code because it captures ramus length on the right. Parents without laterality and siblings measuring other aspects or the left side would not be appropriate. The morphometric context is descriptive and does not add any new attributes like modality or numeric values, so the observable selection remains the same."
196314000,Entire subcarinal lymph node (body structure),Subcarinal lymph node on imaging,"The imaging context does not change the anatomical site referenced: the subcarinal lymph node. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. No size, abnormality, or multiplicity is stated. Broader parent categories or station-based groupings would be less exact than the single entire node. 196314000 correctly represents the entire subcarinal lymph node."
415077006,History of primary malignant neoplasm of bronchus (situation),Chart review reveals a history of primary bronchus cancer.,"“History of” conveys past status, and “primary bronchus cancer” identifies a primary malignant neoplasm located in the bronchus. The main medical concept is history of primary malignant neoplasm of bronchus, with the Situation with explicit context category. “Cancer” is equivalent to malignant neoplasm for coding purposes, without adding histologic detail. Coding to broader lung cancer history or to a current disease state would be less appropriate. No additional attributes (laterality, stage, treatment) are present. SCTID 415077006 is the correct selection."
257584009,Cliff (environment),Cliff area,"The phrase refers to the area characterized as a cliff. The main concept is the environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The correct code is SCTID 257584009 because it denotes a generic cliff without more specific features like edge or face. Parent concepts are too nonspecific, and child/sibling concepts are not indicated. “Area” is a neutral contextual term that keeps the meaning aligned with the cliff environment."
372543001,Purine analog (substance),Compound classification: purine analog,"The entry denotes a compound classification of “purine analog,” directly pointing to the substance class defined by structural analogy to purine. It lacks any product, dose, or therapeutic context, so the SNOMED CT category is Substance. The most accurate code is 372543001 Purine analog (substance). Parent classes like “Purine” and specific children like individual purine analog drugs are not supported by this general class wording."
223850001,Islands of Spain (geographic location),Islas españolas,"“Islas españolas” (Spanish islands) is a direct synonym for “Islands of Spain.” The category is Geographic location. It correctly maps to SNOMED CT 223850001, avoiding broader country-level and narrower specific island group concepts. No additional properties are implied."
413164001,No evidence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (situation),Provider reports no evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction.,"The entry documents a provider’s statement that there is no evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction, without adding other attributes. This is appropriately coded as a Situation concept, SCTID 413164001. A parent concept without LV specificity would be overly broad, and sibling concepts target different dysfunction types. The LV abbreviation maintains the same clinical meaning as the expanded term."
282131002,Non-International System of Units unit of frequency (qualifier value),Non-SI frequency unit noted,"This statement notes that a unit used to represent frequency is non-SI. It is a Qualifier value concept referring to unit classification. It matches SCTID 282131002, distinguishing non-SI frequency units from SI units. Using a parent like general frequency unit would be less specific, whereas naming a particular unit would necessitate a child concept. The wording is a safe paraphrase and does not add any attributes beyond unit classification."
223924004,County Londonderry (geographic location),County Derry,"This uses the accepted alternative name 'Derry' for Londonderry at the county level, with 'County' clearly indicating the county entity rather than the city. The concept class is Geographic location. It matches County Londonderry (223924004). Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., other Northern Ireland counties) would be less appropriate, and the child concept 'Derry/Londonderry city' is explicitly avoided by the 'County' qualifier."
55706007,Fibrinogen Wiesbaden (substance),Analyte name — Fibrinogen Wiesbaden,"Framing the term as an analyte name provides a diagnostic-report context without adding presence, quantity, or result attributes. The primary concept is the specific substance, a named fibrinogen variant. Broader analyte terms (parent) or different variants (siblings) would be less precise. This maps most accurately to the Substance concept SCTID 55706007."
78088001,Hospital-based outpatient ophthalmology clinic (environment),Ophthalmology outpatient clinic within hospital (hospital-based).,"The phrasing identifies an outpatient clinic within a hospital that specializes in ophthalmology, which is an environment. This maps to SNOMED CT 78088001 (Environment or geographical location). It maintains outpatient and hospital-based context and avoids implying departments or other specialties. A general hospital outpatient clinic would be less precise, making this code the optimal match."
731592006,All bone marrow of hand (body structure),Anatomic focus: entire bone marrow of hand,"Despite the contextual label 'Anatomic focus', the core concept is 'entire bone marrow of hand', specifying completeness. Category: Body structure. This maps to SCTID 731592006 and is more precise than a parent concept without 'entire'. The entry does not add clinical attributes or restrict to subregions, thus avoiding sibling or child mappings."
13914008,Entire left external iliac artery (body structure),Anatomic focus: left external iliac artery,"This contextualizes an anatomical reference and names the left external iliac artery, implying the whole vessel with left laterality and no pathology or segment described. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The best code is SCTID 13914008 (“Entire left external iliac artery”), as the entry points to the complete left external iliac artery. Broader parents miss laterality; siblings with right laterality or different iliac vessels are not appropriate; and there are no indications of a specific segment or branch."
85169002,Tunnel construction (environment),Tunnel construction (environment),"The main concept expressed is the environmental context of tunnel construction, without introducing patient attributes, timing, or associated conditions. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Environment or geographical location category. The phrase explicitly matches the preferred term and aligns most precisely with SCTID 85169002. Broader parent concepts such as general construction environments would be less specific, and child or sibling concepts that specify a particular tunnel type or method (e.g., road tunnel or tunnel boring) are not indicated by this wording."
444508009,Child examination at 4.5 years with explicit context (situation),Entry states: child exam at four point five years,"Stated plainly, this entry conveys the child exam at 4.5 years using a spelled-out numeric phrase, and introduces no action status or additional modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context for the 4.5-year child examination. A parent situation without age specificity is too broad, while a procedure code would imply the exam was done. Sibling age-specific situations do not fit because this entry is explicitly four point five years."
433799002,Nerve ganglion specimen (specimen),Specimen entry: nerve ganglion,"The wording reflects a log or entry identifying the specimen as ‘nerve ganglion,’ directly matching SNOMED CT 433799002 in the Specimen hierarchy. It introduces no acquisition method, laterality, or specific ganglion site, so parent concepts are too general and child/sibling concepts requiring method or subsite detail would be inappropriate. The ‘entry’ context is administrative and does not affect the specimen code."
771392003,Stability of joint structure of pelvic girdle (observable entity),Pelvic girdle articulation stability (observed),"This entry captures an observation of stability for pelvic girdle articulations (a clinically equivalent term for joints). It is an Observable entity and maps to SNOMED CT 771392003 since it specifies the property and anatomical scope without providing a result or naming a particular joint. More general parent observables or specific child/sibling codes (e.g., SI joint stability) would be less appropriate given the inclusive pelvic girdle wording and the absence of abnormality or laterality details."
282372007,General unit of biological and biochemical measurement (qualifier value),Unit of measure for biological/biochemical quantitation (general),"The wording points to a general unit designation applicable to quantitation in biological and biochemical contexts, without naming any specific unit. The main concept is a unit qualifier in the bio/biochem domain. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 282372007 is the precise match because it represents general units within biological and biochemical measurement. Mapping to a parent Unit of measure would be too broad, and mapping to a child unit (e.g., IU, U/L) would be too specific. The synonym ""quantitation"" does not change the code selection, as it remains within the same measurement domain and level of generality."
387133006,Carisoprodol (substance),Carisoprodol—active ingredient,"Labeling carisoprodol as an “active ingredient” identifies the substance without specifying a product or administration details. This cleanly maps to Carisoprodol (substance), SCTID 387133006, in the Substance hierarchy. Choosing a medicinal product or combination product sibling would add attributes that are not present in the entry."
709848002,Moderately compromised location and extent of edentulous area of oral cavity (finding),Radiographic impression: findings compatible with moderately compromised location and extent of oral edentulous area,"This imaging-context entry states that radiographic findings align with a moderate compromise in the location and extent of an oral edentulous area. The main elements are the edentulous area and the moderate degree of compromise of location/extent. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 709848002 is appropriate because it encodes the specified severity and dimensions; a parent concept would be less specific, and sibling severities would contradict 'moderately.' The phrase 'compatible with' preserves equivalence of the finding without introducing unrelated attributes."
79073004,Venography of lower extremity (procedure),Lower limb venogram,"Using 'venogram' and 'lower limb' communicates a venography of the lower extremity. Categorized as a Procedure, it appropriately maps to 79073004 given the combination of technique and region. No laterality, vessel subtype, or advanced imaging modality is mentioned, so neither broader venography nor more granular lower-extremity subprocedures fit better."
1367573006,Structure of pulp of right little finger (body structure),Terminal pulp of right little finger,"The term 'terminal pulp' denotes the fingertip soft tissue pad (digital pulp) and is specified for the right little finger. This falls under Body structure, and the exact code is SNOMED CT 1367573006. A parent concept such as 'right little finger structure' would include other tissues, while children like 'skin of terminal pulp' are not indicated. The use of 'terminal pulp' is a clinically acceptable synonym that maintains the same anatomical scope."
42919001,Phylloscopus borealis (organism),Common name: Arctic warbler,"The entry uses the common name corresponding to the species Phylloscopus borealis and labels it as a common name, which is contextual only. No added clinical attributes appear. In SNOMED CT, this is an Organism concept, precisely SCTID 42919001. Parent concepts (genus or broader avian groups) would not be specific enough, and sibling species are different organisms. The synonym is authoritative and does not alter code selection."
224009003,Guam (geographic location),Place: Guam,"This entry conveys Guam purely as a place, which aligns with SNOMED CT’s geographic location under the Location hierarchy (SCTID 224009003). The header 'Place' serves as context without introducing attributes that would trigger different codes. Parents like broader regions or countries are too general, and any child locality would be too specific. The term remains equivalent to the preferred concept, retaining the most accurate match."
223962001,Kintyre (geographic location),Travel reference: Kintyre,"The phrase mentions Kintyre as a travel-related reference, but the codable concept remains the named geographic location. This fits SNOMED CT’s Geographic location category, with SCTID 223962001 most precisely matching Kintyre. Broader parent places (e.g., Scotland) or narrower/sibling locales (e.g., Mull of Kintyre, Campbeltown) would be incorrect based on the wording. The contextual label 'Travel reference' does not introduce new attributes affecting code selection."
160957000,Sudden infant death (event),Infant sudden death event,"The phrase reorders the words but maintains the same meaning: an event where an infant dies suddenly. The main concept is the occurrence of sudden death in the infant age group. Category: Event. This maps to SNOMED CT 160957000 as an event representation. It avoids disorder terminology (syndrome) and does not introduce unexpected/unexplained qualifiers, so sibling concepts like SUID or SIDS would be inappropriate. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and retains the event framing."
427489002,Microhm (qualifier value),Use micro-ohm as the unit,"The directive identifies micro-ohm as the chosen unit, representing 10^-6 ohm. Category: Qualifier value. This is equivalent to 'Microhm' and precisely aligns with SCTID 427489002. It avoids parent/sibling units and does not introduce magnitude, context, or condition details beyond unit specification."
422398009,Nanogram/hour (qualifier value),Unit label: ng/hour,"This entry provides the unit label ng/hour, signifying nanogram per hour. It maps to the SNOMED CT qualifier value Nanogram/hour (SCTID 422398009). No additional attributes are present, preventing misclassification to generic or different unit concepts. The abbreviation is equivalent and maintains the same unit selection."
416897008,Product containing tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (product),Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor drug,"This entry names a drug whose mechanism is TNF-alpha inhibition, pointing precisely to the product class containing a TNF inhibitor (416897008). Category: Product. It remains at the class level without specifying a particular molecule or brand, so child concepts (e.g., adalimumab product) are excluded. Broader parents (e.g., immunomodulatory product) or different cytokine-targeting sibling classes do not fit the TNF-alpha target. The term “drug” secures the product hierarchy rather than substance, and the wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
363825004,Intracranial pressure observable (observable entity),Physiologic parameter: intracranial pressure,"The entry labels intracranial pressure as a physiologic parameter, which is the core nature of the observable. Category: Observable entity. It should be coded to 363825004 since it names the parameter without any abnormality, timing, or procedural implication. It does not indicate CSF-specific pressure or disorders like intracranial hypertension, making child or sibling concepts less precise. ‘Physiologic parameter’ is context, not a new attribute."
411304000,Caine mix II (product),Requested product: Caine mix II,"This entry indicates a request but specifically identifies the product Caine mix II. The main concept is the medicinal product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Without any dose, route, or strength details, SCTID 411304000 is the appropriate code. Mapping to a parent local anesthetic product would be too general, and child concepts for specific forms would add unsupported detail. The request context does not affect the product identification."
361328001,Entire renal pyramid (body structure),Specimen site: entire renal pyramid,"This entry indicates the specimen site is the entire renal pyramid, maintaining focus on the whole anatomical pyramid without adding qualitative attributes. It is a Body structure concept. The wording maps precisely to “Entire renal pyramid (body structure).” Using a parent like renal medulla would be overly broad (multiple pyramids), while selecting a child such as renal papilla or base would capture only a portion, contradicting the ‘entire’ specification."
411803004,Bombyx mori diagnostic allergen extract (product),Silkworm diagnostic allergen extract (species: Bombyx mori),"The entry uses the common name and explicitly confirms the species as Bombyx mori, and identifies the product as a diagnostic allergen extract. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It maps precisely to SCTID 411803004 because the species is specified; a parent concept would be too generic, and other silkworm species siblings would be incorrect. This synonymic phrasing does not alter the underlying concept."
215634008,Fall on stairs in water transport (event),Fall on stairs on a watercraft.,"This phrase identifies a fall and the location as stairs, with ‘watercraft’ indicating the water transport setting. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps to 215634008 because it includes both the stair component and water transport context. Parent concepts lack specificity, and siblings involving other structures (e.g., ladders) or land-based contexts are not suitable. ‘Watercraft’ is a standard synonym for a vessel used in water transport, maintaining coding equivalence."
224769008,Domestic vegetable garden (environment),Domestic vegetable garden,"The entry explicitly states a domestic vegetable garden, which matches the SNOMED CT concept Domestic vegetable garden (environment) 224769008. The main concept is an environmental feature at a residence used to grow vegetables, with the attribute 'domestic' clearly indicating home/residential context. Category: Environment. This is the most precise match compared to broader parents like Garden (environment) or Vegetable garden (environment) without domestic specification, and it is distinct from siblings such as community or commercial gardens. No additional attributes are introduced."
223362006,Bora-Bora (geographic location),Patient-reported place: Bora-Bora,"The entry uses a patient-report context label but clearly names Bora-Bora as the geographic location, which is the codable concept. The main concept is Bora-Bora; the phrase does not add attributes like residence duration or travel timing. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location); the best code is Bora-Bora (geographic location) [223362006]. Parent concepts (French Polynesia) are broader and inappropriate, and siblings (e.g., Moorea) are different places. No child localities within Bora-Bora are included. The context label is neutral and does not change the semantic scope."
419252006,Fluoroscopy of penis (procedure),Fluoroscopic study of the penis,"The term 'study' denotes an imaging procedure, and 'fluoroscopic' specifies the modality, with 'penis' as the site, fitting the Procedure Fluoroscopy of penis (419252006). There is no mention of contrast, urethral focus, vascular imaging, or interventional guidance, so sibling or child concepts like urethrograms or cavernosography are excluded. A generic parent like fluoroscopic study without site would be less precise. This is a clinically equivalent paraphrase and remains uniquely codable to the specified concept."
789313002,Photographic image of anterior teeth (record artifact),Clinical media: anterior teeth photograph,"This denotes a clinical media item that is a photograph of the anterior teeth, matching Photographic image of anterior teeth (789313002). Conceptually, it is a record artifact image; explicit attributes are photographic modality and anterior teeth anatomy. Category: Record artifact. It is not a photography procedure and does not include broader or narrower anatomical scope, making parent or sibling concepts less suitable. 'Photograph' is synonymous with 'photographic image'."
249023008,Bishop's score of cervix (observable entity),OB note: cervical Bishop score,"The context 'OB note' frames where the observable is documented but the medical concept remains the Bishop score applied to the cervix. No value, modification, or procedural detail is included. This fits the Observable entity category and maps to SCTID 249023008. More general observables or procedure concepts would be less precise, and modified Bishop score is not indicated. The synonym 'cervical Bishop score' is equivalent to the preferred term and supports the same code."
213882002,Train accident involving explosion (event),Railroad accident with explosion,"This phrasing uses 'railroad' as a synonymous term for 'train/railway,' paired with 'accident' and 'with explosion,' clearly conveying a rail transport accident in which an explosion occurred. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps to 213882002 because it combines the train accident and explosion components. Choosing a parent like 'train accident (event)' would omit the explosion detail; selecting 'explosion (event)' alone would omit the transport accident context. 'Railroad' is a clinically equivalent synonym for train/railway and does not change the code selection."
469993009,Low-air-loss bed (physical object),Low air loss bed in use,"The phrase identifies the specific bed type, with hyphenation omitted ('low air loss') but semantically equivalent. The concept is a Physical object: low-air-loss bed, SNOMED CT 469993009. The note that it is 'in use' adds context but does not introduce attributes that would alter device classification. It is more specific than a generic bed and is distinct from related devices like low-air-loss mattresses, ensuring the most precise match."
270107007,Coroner's postmortem report (record artifact),Coroner's postmortem examination report,"The main concept is a report documenting a postmortem examination authored by a coroner, which is a record artifact. This precisely aligns with SCTID 270107007, since 'postmortem examination report' and 'postmortem report' are clinically synonymous and the coroner attribution is explicit. A generic 'postmortem examination report' (parent) lacks the coroner specificity, and 'hospital autopsy report' (sibling) would imply a different setting/author. No added attributes beyond the inherent coroner authorship are present."
81703003,Chews tobacco (finding),Imaging report (social history): chews tobacco,"This entry records in the imaging report’s social history section that the patient chews tobacco. No timing, frequency, or related conditions are stated. The primary concept is tobacco chewing, which is a Clinical finding. The best SNOMED match is Chews tobacco (finding) [81703003], as it specifies chewing rather than general smokeless tobacco use. Parent codes like Uses smokeless tobacco are too general, and sibling codes such as Uses snuff do not fit. The imaging report context is documentation framing and does not alter the underlying concept, maintaining unique codability."
4191000179101,Emergency nursing report (record artifact),Emergency nursing report file,"The entry denotes a file representing an emergency nursing report, which is a record artifact. The SNOMED CT concept Emergency nursing report (record artifact), category Record artifact, SCTID 4191000179101, best fits. The term “file” simply indicates the stored document form and does not add clinical attributes or alter the artifact type. Parent concepts like general nursing report or unrelated sibling artifacts such as physician reports are less accurate. The wording maintains specificity to emergency nursing and a report."
185014001,Report to benefits agency (record artifact),Patient statement: report to benefits agency,"This presents a patient-reported context but the artifact is still clearly a report to a benefits agency. The context marker does not change the artifact type or introduce additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the precise code is SCTID 185014001. A parent such as generic “report” would omit the recipient; siblings like “request to benefits agency” or “letter” are not correct because the entry explicitly names a report."
155111000146108,Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System score (observable entity),Coronary disease reporting score (CAD-RADS),"A paraphrase using 'coronary disease reporting score' plus the acronym CAD-RADS still denotes the same standardized CAD-RADS score, an observable entity for coronary CTA reporting. Since no category value is specified, SCTID 155111000146108 is the precise match. The wording does not introduce a sibling system or a child category."
10212000,Kocher's sign (finding),Kocher's sign present,"The statement explicitly asserts the presence of Kocher's sign as a clinical examination finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The best code is Kocher's sign (finding) [10212000], since 'present' only indicates that the sign is observed and does not introduce severity, timing, cause, or co-conditions. Broader parent categories are too general, and no other eponymous sign is referenced."
426621004,Genus Alkalilimnicola (organism),Genus Alkalilimnicola,"The entry explicitly names the taxonomic rank and the organism: Genus Alkalilimnicola. The main concept is the organism taxon at genus level without any clinical qualifiers or findings. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with an Organism category concept, specifically SCTID 426621004 for Genus Alkalilimnicola (organism). It does not introduce attributes such as infection, detection status, specimen source, species-level designation, or timing, so parent concepts like broader taxa or child concepts such as specific Alkalilimnicola species are less precise. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and remains a pure genus-level reference."
223661006,Bosnia - Herzegovnia (geographic location),Patient reports living in Bosnia and Herzegovina,"While the text provides living context, the sole specific named entity is the country Bosnia and Herzegovina. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location), and SCTID 223661006 is the most precise code. No broader area or more granular location is stated, so using a parent or child concept would be inaccurate."
122599003,Specimen from breast obtained by radical mastectomy (specimen),Breast sample obtained at radical mastectomy,"This concise documentation indicates a breast sample (specimen) obtained at the time of radical mastectomy. The concept is a Specimen, squarely aligning with SCTID 122599003 through explicit source and acquisition method. More general parents (e.g., breast sample without method) or different mastectomy siblings would not be as precise. 'Sample' is a synonym for specimen that is acceptable and does not change the intended code."
115309002,Antigen of Human immunodeficiency virus 2 protein 41 (substance),HIV-2 p41 antigen,"This entry uses the common shorthand p41 for protein 41 and clearly indicates it is the antigen of HIV-2 p41. The main concept is an antigenic substance corresponding to HIV-2 protein 41. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The synonym p41 is clinically equivalent to protein 41 and does not alter the identity of the substance, keeping the code selection aligned with Antigen of Human immunodeficiency virus 2 protein 41. A parent like HIV-2 antigen lacks the protein specificity, while siblings such as HIV-1 p41 antigen or HIV-2 p36 antigen represent different entities. The entry does not introduce any test results, antibodies, severity, or method, so it remains uniquely codable to the antigen substance rather than a procedure or finding concept."
257471003,Roman numeral III (qualifier value),Recorded as Roman numeral three: III,"The text states the numeral is Roman numeral three and shows 'III', directly fitting Roman numeral III (SCTID 257471003) as a Qualifier value. This phrasing is a clinically safe synonym that clarifies format without introducing attributes. It is not 'Stage III' or 'Grade III', so those qualifier concepts are less appropriate. Sibling numerals and parent generic categories are excluded by the explicit 'III'."
217899000,Accidental stepping on stationary object (event),HPI: mechanism was accidentally stepping on a non-moving object,"The history of present illness describes the mechanism as accidental stepping on a non-moving (stationary) object, which is an Event. Accidental stepping on stationary object (event) [217899000] is the most accurate code because it mirrors the stated mechanism. Parent categories such as generic accidental events lack the specificity, and sibling events (tripping, slipping, collision) or stepping on moving objects are not implied. The synonym “non-moving object” is equivalent to stationary object. No additional attributes (injury details, severity, context) are provided, keeping the mapping exact."
385331001,Botulinum toxin type C (substance),BoNT/C,"BoNT/C is a commonly used abbreviation for botulinum neurotoxin type C. Abbreviation does not alter the substance identity; it still denotes the same serotype C toxin. This maps to SNOMED CT Substance: Botulinum toxin type C (substance) [385331001]. It is more specific than the parent toxin concept and excludes other serotypes, and the entry introduces no product, dose, route, or clinical context that would require a different code."
768459000,Product containing iron and/or iron compound (product),Medicinal product containing iron,"The entry clearly states a medicinal product with iron as an ingredient, mapping directly to 768459000. Category: Product. It does not mention any particular iron salt, route (oral/IV), or dosage form, avoiding child concepts such as ferrous sulfate product or intravenous iron product. It is more specific than a generic product category and is not a substance-level concept, so 768459000 is the precise match."
171242005,Chromosome abnormality screening (procedure),Plan: chromosomal abnormality screening,"This denotes a clinical plan to carry out screening for chromosomal abnormalities, which references the specific Procedure. It maps to SNOMED CT 171242005 because the identified activity is the chromosomal abnormality screening itself. The entry does not include modality, population, or result, keeping it at the appropriate granularity. Parent concepts like generic screening are too broad, and child concepts such as prenatal screening or specific cytogenetic tests would be overly specific absent any indicators in the text."
307431003,Frequency per unit time (qualifier value),Attribute — frequency per unit time,"Main concept: the attribute type is frequency per unit time; the word “Attribute” signals a data element context without changing semantics. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 307431003 is the precise mapping since the phrase describes frequency normalized by time as a qualifier attribute. Parent or sibling qualifiers (e.g., general “Frequency,” “Rate,” “Interval”) would be less accurate given the explicit per-time phrasing. The paraphrase is equivalent and introduces no new attributes beyond its role as an attribute label."
72017006,Structure of inferior conjunctival fornix (body structure),Inferior fornix (conjunctiva),"The parenthetical clarification ensures the term refers to the conjunctival fornix, not another anatomical fornix (e.g., cerebral). Specifying “inferior” unambiguously identifies the lower conjunctival fornix. This is a SNOMED CT Body structure matching SCTID 72017006. Parent concepts like Structure of conjunctival fornix are too general, and the superior fornix sibling does not fit the inferior designation."
1365867004,Photographic intraoral image with view of teeth showing gingival recession (record artifact),Intraoral photographic image documenting gingival recession with the teeth visible.,"The statement identifies an intraoral photographic image that documents gingival recession and confirms the teeth are visible, exactly aligning with the concept’s scope. As a Record artifact, it denotes recorded media rather than a clinical diagnosis. A parent artifact such as generic intraoral photo would not reflect the content showing gingival recession; conversely, using a finding code would misclassify the entry. The wording uses equivalent synonyms and maintains the required attributes without introducing laterality, severity, or other modifiers."
465216002,Solvent recycling system (physical object),History note: solvent recycling system,"Main concept: solvent recycling system documented in a history note, still referring to the same physical object. Attributes: none added to the object identity. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The best code is SCTID 465216002 because the term clearly denotes the solvent recycling system; the history context does not change the concept. Parent generic system entries are too broad, and child specifics (e.g., distillation-only systems) are not stated. Sibling concepts for other solvent-related devices are inappropriate."
409206005,Product containing neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist (product),NK1 receptor antagonist pharmacologic product,"The entry denotes a pharmacologic product classified by its action as an NK1 receptor antagonist. This belongs to the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category. The best match is SCTID 409206005, which represents products containing NK1 antagonists at the class level, without details that would point to a clinical drug or specific ingredient. A substance concept is not appropriate because the entry is framed as a product. The synonym 'pharmacologic product' retains the same scope as 'product' in the preferred term."
223749005,Sulawesi (geographic location),Place name: Sulawesi,"The entry identifies Sulawesi as a place name, keeping the codable concept as the geographic location without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223749005 is the precise match. It does not suggest coding to broader or narrower locations, avoiding parent (Indonesia) or child (provincial) concepts."
64816001,Upper middle class economic status (social concept),Upper-middle socioeconomic status (SES),"This phrasing expresses the socioeconomic status as upper-middle using the common abbreviation SES, which is clinically equivalent to economic status in this context. The main concept is the classification of SES at the upper-middle tier. The SNOMED CT category is Social concept. SCTID 64816001 is the precise match because it codes for upper middle class economic status; broader SES categories are insufficiently specific, and alternative class levels would be inaccurate. The synonym ‘socioeconomic status’ is equivalent and does not add or change attributes."
287730002,Local excision of kidney (procedure),Limited excision of kidney,"“Limited” functions as a clinically equivalent descriptor to “local,” both indicating a small, confined excision rather than extensive resection. The main concept is a limited surgical removal of kidney tissue. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps most precisely to SCTID 287730002 because it reflects a localized excision without elevating it to partial nephrectomy or total nephrectomy, and does not suggest diagnostic intent. Parent terms are overly broad, and child/sibling terms like “wedge resection of kidney” or “biopsy” introduce specificity or method not stated. The synonym does not introduce new attributes."
312255008,Ionizing electromagnetic radiation (physical force),Ionizing EMR,"EMR here unambiguously stands for electromagnetic radiation; paired with 'ionizing,' it identifies the physical phenomenon of ionizing electromagnetic radiation. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 312255008 is the precise match because it represents ionizing electromagnetic radiation specifically, not the broader electromagnetic spectrum nor non-EM ionizing radiation. Children such as X radiation or Gamma radiation are not specified, and the entry does not imply exposure or procedure, avoiding misclassification to finding or event concepts."
411905007,Carya pecan pollen specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),"Inventory: diagnostic allergen extract, Carya pecan pollen","This inventory note identifies a diagnostic allergen extract with Carya pecan pollen as the source. Attributes are allergen source (pecan pollen) and diagnostic purpose. The category is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). It matches SCTID 411905007 by specifying the pecan pollen diagnostic extract. Parent concepts that generalize to pollen extracts are too broad, and siblings such as therapeutic extracts or non-pollen pecan extracts would misrepresent the product. The synonymy is direct and maintains the exact concept."
840700004,Everolimus 100 microgram/cm2 drug eluting stent (product),Everolimus 100 mcg/cm2 DES,"This entry denotes a drug-eluting stent (DES) that elutes everolimus at 100 micrograms per square centimeter. “mcg” is a common clinical synonym for micrograms and “DES” is a widely used abbreviation for drug-eluting stent; both are semantically equivalent and do not introduce new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The inclusion of the drug (everolimus) and the dose density (100 mcg/cm2) makes this a precise match to SCTID 840700004. More general parent terms like “Drug-eluting stent (product)” lack the drug and dosing details, and siblings with other dose densities or drugs would be inaccurate. No brand, site, size, or temporal attributes are added, keeping the mapping uniquely aligned to the specified product."
116939008,"Calcium ionophore induced platelet aggregation, function (observable entity)",Aggregation response to calcium ionophore (platelets),"This entry defines the measured response—aggregation of platelets—to the calcium ionophore stimulus. Category: Observable entity. The stimulus specification and the aggregation context map directly to 116939008. It does not report a value or interpretation, nor switch to a different agonist or broader platelet function, hence parent/sibling concepts are less precise. “Response” is a synonymous description of function without adding attributes."
263638005,Endometriosis classification of American Fertility Society (staging scale),Staging framework: AFS endometriosis classification,"The phrase identifies the staging framework used—AFS endometriosis classification—and does not present a stage or score. The category is Assessment scale, matching Endometriosis classification of American Fertility Society (staging scale) 263638005. More general staging frameworks would be less specific, and child/sibling concepts like AFS stage levels or ASRM/rAFS classifications are not intended here. “Framework” is a permissible synonym for the classification system artifact."
48176007,Social context (social concept),Social context discussed,"This statement indicates that the social context domain was discussed, without stating any social attributes or statuses. The appropriate code is Social context (social concept) [48176007], in the Social concept category, representing the contextual domain without implying a finding. It avoids mapping to child or sibling concepts like social problems or specific determinants by remaining general. The discussion phrasing does not change the concept, so 48176007 fits best."
701871010000101,Immunoglobulin G4 antibody to Lactuca sativa (substance),IgG4 subtype antibody to Lactuca sativa,"“Subtype” clarifies the immunoglobulin subclass as IgG4, and the antigen is Lactuca sativa, defining the antibody substance. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This fits SCTID 701871010000101 due to the explicit IgG4 isotype and Lactuca sativa target. Broader parent concepts and sibling entries for alternate subclasses or antigens would not match. There is no indication of testing, measurements, or clinical assessment, so observable or finding codes are not appropriate."
699053009,Foot pulse check declined (situation),Declined assessment of foot pulses.,"This entry documents a declined assessment of foot pulses, meaning the proposed foot pulse exam was not performed because of patient refusal. Category: Situation. Code 699053009 'Foot pulse check declined' precisely captures this event, with 'assessment' functioning as a synonym for 'check/exam.' Parent concepts without anatomical specificity and sibling concepts addressing peripheral pulses more generally would be less appropriate. The statement avoids extra attributes such as laterality or reasons."
1351225007,Stereographic technique (qualifier value),Stereographic technique per protocol,"This indicates the protocol specifies the stereographic technique, stating only the method without further attributes. The concept type is Qualifier value, and the most accurate SNOMED match is Stereographic technique. Parent or sibling techniques are not appropriate because the term specifies stereographic."
56775002,Free-standing respiratory disease clinic (environment),Visit conducted in a non-hospital respiratory disease clinic,"The phrase denotes an encounter environment that is a respiratory disease clinic and not hospital-based, which is equivalent to free-standing. Category: Environment. SCTID 56775002 is appropriate due to inclusion of both the specialty and independence attributes. Parent concepts lacking one of these, or siblings adding different qualifiers, would be less accurate."
838458004,Product containing carrier oil (product),Product with carrier oil,"The wording “with carrier oil” is a clinically equivalent way to say the product includes carrier oil in its composition, matching “Product containing carrier oil (product)” [838458004]. The SNOMED category is Product. It avoids adding details such as brand, dosage form, administration route, or the specific oil. Parent concepts like “Product” are too general, and siblings/children specifying particular oils (e.g., mineral, coconut, soybean) would not be supported by this entry. Thus, the given concept is the most precise match."
223402007,"Sint Maarten, Dutch part (geographic location)","Sint Maarten, Dutch side","This wording identifies Sint Maarten and clarifies the Dutch side, which is semantically identical to “Dutch part.” Main concept: geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. It is the most precise match for 223402007, not a parent (entire island) or sibling (French part), due to the explicit Dutch-side designation."
445665009,Final report (record artifact),Final report finalized,"This wording highlights that the report has reached its final, finalized state, not open to further revision. The main concept is the final report artifact; the attribute is completion/finalization. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps to 445665009 because the artifact is clearly final. Generic report concepts are insufficiently specific, and related statuses like draft or interim do not apply. 'Finalized' here is a status synonym reinforcing finality and does not change code selection."
285081003,Cycle track (environment),Found at the cycle track,"This notes presence at a cycle track as the environment without implying additional specifics. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 285081003 fits, as it uniquely identifies the cycle track and avoids mapping to related environments such as roads, sidewalks, or cycle lanes. The entry introduces no extra clinical attributes beyond location."
270411005,Court of protection certificate (record artifact),Court of Protection certificate scanned as document,"The entry names the artifact—Court of Protection certificate—and mentions it was scanned, which is an operational context. The concept is a Record artifact, with the exact SNOMED CT code 'Court of protection certificate (record artifact)' SCTID 270411005. Mapping to a parent like 'Scanned document' would be incorrect because the specific type remains a Court of Protection certificate. Sibling concepts such as 'Court order' or 'Advance decision' are different document types. The scanning context does not alter the artifact type, so the certificate code is the precise match."
419830007,Mebeverine (substance),Drug ingredient — mebeverine,"The concept here is mebeverine as a drug ingredient, i.e., the pharmacologic substance itself, with no mention of dose, route, brand, salt, or clinical indication. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The best match is Mebeverine (substance) SCTID 419830007. Parent classes such as general pharmaceutical substances are overly broad, while sibling/child concepts like mebeverine hydrochloride (salt) or any medicinal product would be more specific in ways not stated. The ‘drug ingredient’ phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym for the substance."
429032004,History of vesicoureteric reflux (situation),Reported past vesicoureteric reflux.,"“Reported past” explicitly conveys that the VUR occurred historically, not currently, which places the concept in the Situation with explicit context category. The most accurate SNOMED CT code is 429032004 (History of vesicoureteric reflux). Mapping to the VUR disorder code would wrongly indicate an ongoing condition, and choosing related family or generalized urinary history codes would reduce specificity. The synonym “vesicoureteric” does not alter the concept and introduces no extra attributes."
47956003,Replacement of drain of vagina (procedure),Clinical documentation: vaginal drain exchange,"The entry denotes a device exchange (replacement) at the vaginal site, a Procedure matching “Replacement of drain of vagina.” The essential elements—drain, vagina, exchange—precisely align with SCTID 47956003. It is not a better fit for insertion/removal or adjustment siblings because “exchange” clearly implies replacing an indwelling device. This does not introduce any new attributes; the documentation context simply reflects where the statement is captured."
441481000124100,Management of schedule of parenteral nutrition (procedure),"Patient: ""They changed the schedule for my parenteral nutrition.""","A patient-reported statement that the schedule for PN was changed implies management of the PN timing plan. The primary concept is management of the schedule of parenteral nutrition, focusing on scheduling without specifying dose, rate, or indications. Category: Procedure. SCTID 441481000124100 matches as it directly covers management of PN scheduling. Concepts like administration or initiation of PN would mischaracterize the action. The patient phrasing is a lay synonym describing the same procedural activity of schedule management."
114256005,Aerobic Actinomycetes (organism),Aerobic actinomycete bacteria,"The term describes bacteria that are aerobic actinomycetes, aligning with the organism group of oxygen-requiring actinomycetes. This is an Organism concept in SNOMED CT. SCTID 114256005 Aerobic Actinomycetes (organism) is the precise match. A parent like Actinomycetes would be too broad (anaerobic members included), and a child such as Nocardia or Streptomyces would be too specific. The addition of 'bacteria' is a clinically equivalent descriptor for actinomycetes and does not alter the taxonomy or introduce extraneous attributes."
1208851000,Provoked Brugada electrocardiograph pattern (finding),Brugada ECG pattern revealed with provocation,"The phrase 'revealed with provocation' indicates a Brugada pattern that appears on ECG only when provoked, aligning exactly to the Clinical finding 'Provoked Brugada electrocardiograph pattern'. It excludes spontaneous presentation and does not imply Brugada syndrome. The synonym 'revealed' for 'provoked/unmasked' does not add new attributes and maintains the correct level of specificity."
773437003,Trauma surgery care plan (record artifact),Trauma surgery care plan document,"This entry frames the care plan as a document, which is consistent with SNOMED’s record artifact hierarchy. The concept is a care plan for trauma surgery, making SCTID 773437003 the most accurate code. A generic surgical care plan or generic care plan would be broader, while trauma care plan without surgery would be narrower in the wrong dimension. “Document” does not alter the clinical meaning and remains within the record artifact context, avoiding attributes like timing or severity."
102416003,Bathing water pollution (event),Bathing water pollution issue.,"Describing the issue as bathing water pollution maintains the focus on the event of pollution in bathing waters, matching SNOMED CT 102416003. Category: Event. The term 'issue' is contextual and does not alter attributes, avoiding drift to parent general water pollution or to sibling concepts like drinking/pool water pollution."
328365009,Calcium intolerance food (product),Kitchen prepared calcium intolerance food,"This entry documents preparation of a food product intended for calcium intolerance, focusing on the product category. It falls under SNOMED CT Product (Food), not a clinical finding or diet regimen. It avoids specifying content such as calcium-free/low and introduces no severity or timing attributes. General food product codes would be too nonspecific, and sibling composition-based food concepts would add unstated attributes. Therefore, Calcium intolerance food (product) is the most accurate code."
235163000,Partial esophagectomy with supra-aortic reconstruction (procedure),Partial esophagectomy with reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels,The concept expressed is partial esophagectomy together with reconstruction of the supra-aortic vessels. Category: Procedure. 'Reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'supra-aortic reconstruction' and does not alter scope. Parent concepts (esophagectomy variants without vascular work) and sibling concepts (isolated supra-aortic reconstruction) do not capture both components. SCTID 235163000 precisely represents this combined procedure.
110950001,Urinary bladder cytologic material (specimen),Bladder-derived cytologic material (specimen),"The phrase clarifies that the specimen is cytologic material derived from the bladder, with no technique or timing included. The main concept is a bladder-sourced cytology specimen within the Specimen hierarchy. SCTID 110950001 best represents this. Using a parent concept (generic cytology material or bladder specimen) would be too broad, and selecting siblings/children such as urine cytology or brushings/washings would introduce method/source differences not present in the entry."
286238004,Does coordinate airflow and voice onset (finding),Airflow and voice onset are coordinated.,"The statement conveys that coordination exists between airflow and the start of voicing, i.e., a positive finding. This aligns with the Clinical finding 'Does coordinate airflow and voice onset' (286238004). A parent concept that only references coordination as a general topic or an observable test would be less specific, and any child or sibling indicating abnormality or lack of coordination would not match. The passive construction retains the same clinical meaning as the preferred term."
122696004,Specimen from uterus obtained by radical hysterectomy (specimen),Case file lists specimen as uterus from radical hysterectomy.,"This entry conveys that the specimen in the case file is the uterus and that it originated from a radical hysterectomy. It fits the Specimen category and matches SCTID 122696004. Parent or sibling concepts missing either the anatomical source or the specific procedure would be less accurate. The case-file context does not introduce additional clinical attributes, preserving alignment with the concept."
80017006,Injection of phenol into sympathetic nerve (procedure),Phenol given by injection to the sympathetic nerve,"This entry states the administration route (injection), the agent (phenol), and the target (sympathetic nerve). The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It exactly corresponds to SCTID 80017006. Concepts with different substances or additional anatomical specificity would be less appropriate. The phrasing is a semantic equivalent and introduces no extra attributes, keeping the code selection precise."
229792005,Ounce/week (qualifier value),Documented in ounces per week,"The phrase indicates that documentation uses 'ounces per week' as the unit, reflecting the qualifier value for ounce/week. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It maps to 229792005 since it conveys the unitized rate of ounces over a week. Parents such as 'ounce' or 'per week' alone are incomplete, and siblings (e.g., 'ounces per month') change the interval. No quantity, substance, or condition is specified; it is strictly the unit."
286629008,Hard X-radiation (physical force),Hard X-ray radiation,"This is a direct synonym for hard X-radiation, focusing on the radiation composed of high-energy X-rays. The concept remains a Physical force. It aligns exactly with SCTID 286629008 as it denotes the radiation type (hard X-ray) without introducing exposure, dose, timing, or procedural attributes. More general parents (e.g., X-radiation) or siblings (e.g., soft X-radiation) would be less precise given the explicit 'hard' qualifier."
360219008,Mechanical pressure (physical force),Mechanical pressure recorded,"Recording context leaves the concept as the physical force 'mechanical pressure,' which aligns with SNOMED CT 360219008. The statement does not imply compression, shear, or other forces, and it avoids turning the entry into a clinical finding or disorder. No new attributes are introduced, so the mechanical pressure (physical force) code is the most precise match."
427951003,History of radiofrequency ablation operation for arrhythmia (situation),Cardiology history: radiofrequency ablation for arrhythmia,"The cardiology history section notes radiofrequency ablation for arrhythmia, implying the procedure occurred previously and is part of the patient’s history, i.e., a situation. The primary concept is prior RF ablation for arrhythmia, not an ongoing procedure or a disorder. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The best match is SCTID 427951003. Parent concepts lack modality specificity, and sibling/child terms introducing arrhythmia subtype or different ablation techniques would not align with the general 'arrhythmia' and specified radiofrequency. The wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
119622007,Pelvis manipulation (procedure),Pelvic manipulation,"This entry expresses the same procedural action using the adjective “pelvic,” which is clinically synonymous with “of the pelvis.” The concept category is Procedure, and the most precise match is Pelvis manipulation (procedure) SCTID 119622007. The synonym does not introduce any new attributes or imply a specific joint or technique; it simply refers to manipulation involving the pelvis as a structure. It does not better fit a parent (generic manipulation) or a sibling (e.g., hip manipulation), nor a child specifying a subtype, thus the given concept remains the best fit."
473409003,Central venous catheter submitted as specimen (specimen),"Patient statement: ""They sent my central line as a specimen.""","The lay term ""central line"" corresponds to a central venous catheter (CVC) in clinical usage. The patient’s statement still identifies the device being submitted as the specimen, fitting the Specimen category. No cause, tip-only, or subtype is implied, avoiding child concepts like PICC or catheter tip specimens; and the term is more specific than generic device specimen parents. The appropriate code is 473409003."
399460001,Specimen from extrahepatic bile duct (specimen),Specimen site: extrahepatic bile duct,"The entry specifies a specimen and its site as the extrahepatic bile duct, directly aligning with the SNOMED CT Specimen concept SCTID 399460001. There are no added attributes such as technique, specimen type, or timing, precluding child concepts. Parent concepts lacking extrahepatic specificity would be too general compared to the stated site."
259936003,Reticulin antibody - type 2 (substance),Type II reticulin antibody,"Reordering the terms still conveys the same substance: an antibody against reticulin, type II. The entry introduces no result status, method, or isotype; it remains a pure substance reference. The correct SNOMED CT category is Substance. More general antibodies or different type classifications would be less accurate. 'Type II' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'type 2' and preserves the exact meaning required for the given concept."
771773003,Open repair of incisional hernia using synthetic mesh (procedure),Open repair of incisional hernia defect using synthetic mesh,"This entry indicates an open repair of an incisional hernia defect with synthetic mesh, which is a Procedure. The best match is SNOMED CT 771773003, as it requires open approach and synthetic mesh for incisional hernia repair. More general parent concepts omit material or approach details. Sibling/child concepts involving laparoscopic access or biologic mesh are excluded by the text. The word “defect” reiterates the hernia site without adding location or extent attributes and remains consistent with the repair concept."
463226006,"Orthodontic appliance system, progressive (physical object)",Series-based orthodontic appliance system,"'Series-based' indicates a set of appliances used sequentially, equivalent to a progressive orthodontic appliance system. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It fits Orthodontic appliance system, progressive (SCTID 463226006) because it denotes a system employed in series. Coding to general orthodontic appliance systems would omit the progressive aspect; coding to specific device types would add unmentioned modality. The paraphrase maintains semantic equivalence."
388819006,Genus Liberiictis (organism),Genus Liberiictis,"The main concept explicitly names the taxonomic entity at the genus rank: Liberiictis. No additional attributes such as species, strain, disease association, or presence in a specimen are stated. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Organism hierarchy, specifically the concept for Genus Liberiictis. More general parents like 'Genus (organism)' or 'Organism' are too broad, and any child concept at the species level would be too narrow. Sibling genera would be incorrect because the entry specifies Liberiictis. The wording matches the preferred term and does not change code selection."
223708005,Saint Kitts and Nevis (geographic location),St Kitts and Nevis,"The concept referenced is the country Saint Kitts and Nevis, using a common abbreviation 'St' for 'Saint' that is clinically and geographically synonymous. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223708005 is the correct, most specific code for the sovereign country. Parent concepts (e.g., 'Country') would be too general, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., the individual islands) would be incomplete. The abbreviation does not add or change attributes; it is a recognized synonym."
214586003,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving being hit by object thrown into or on motor vehicle while in motion, occupant of tram injured (event)",Tram occupant injured in noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident caused by an object thrown into/on the moving tram.,"The entry explicitly describes an external cause event in which a tram occupant is injured during a motor vehicle traffic accident that is noncollision and involves a thrown object impacting a vehicle while it is in motion. The main concepts are: noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident, thrown object into/on the moving vehicle, and injured occupant of a tram. This aligns precisely with SNOMED CT concept 214586003, categorized as an Event. More general parent concepts (e.g., generic noncollision traffic accidents or unspecified vehicle occupants) lack the tram-occupant and thrown-object specificity, while sibling or child concepts (e.g., collision accidents, nontraffic incidents, or specifying driver/passenger) introduce differences not present in the wording. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term without adding attributes like severity or timing."
166461005,Free androgenic index within reference range (finding),Free androgen index falls within the reference interval,"The statement communicates that the free androgen index lies within the reference interval, a normal finding. This is a Clinical finding. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is 166461005, free androgenic index within reference range. Observable entity codes for the index itself are less appropriate because they lack the normality aspect, and abnormal siblings are not indicated. 'Reference interval' is a standard laboratory synonym for 'reference range.'"
165123009,Nonsurgical biopsy result normal (finding),Nonsurgical biopsy shows normal results.,"This entry states that the nonsurgical biopsy yields normal results, maintaining the key attributes of test type and result value. It is a Clinical finding and appropriately maps to SNOMED CT SCTID 165123009. It avoids introducing body site, timing, or severity. Parent concepts omitting 'nonsurgical' are less precise, and sibling variants such as abnormal or negative findings do not match the wording."
1055294009,Blunt impact (physical force),Mechanism: blunt impact,"The entry documents the mechanism as a blunt impact without adding site, timing, or injury details. The main concept is a nonpenetrating impact force. This maps to Blunt impact (physical force) [1055294009] within the Physical force hierarchy. Using 'mechanism' provides context but does not change the underlying physical force being coded. More general parents like Impact (physical force) are not as precise, and siblings like Penetrating impact are not implied by the wording."
258463000,Jejunal fluid specimen (specimen),Jejunal lumen fluid specimen,"Specifying 'lumen' maintains the same anatomical source (jejunum) and the same material (fluid), still denoting a specimen and aligning with Jejunal fluid specimen (SCTID 258463000) under Specimen. Mentioning lumen does not introduce a different attribute or method; it clarifies typical origin. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings like duodenal or ileal fluid specimens are excluded. The synonym preserves equivalence and does not require a different code."
242643004,Bite of animal flea (event),Visit reason: animal flea bite,"This frames the animal flea bite as the reason for the visit, but the clinical concept remains the event of being bitten by an animal flea. No site, severity, or sequelae are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Event, with SCTID 242643004 being the precise match. More general insect bite events or more specific species-level bites are not appropriate. The 'visit reason' context does not alter the concept being coded."
333710000,Product containing immunoglobulin (product),Ig product (medication),"The phrase identifies a medication product containing immunoglobulin using the common abbreviation “Ig,” which is an accepted clinical shorthand for immunoglobulin. This is a Product category concept in SNOMED CT, best matched by “Product containing immunoglobulin (product)” SCTID 333710000. The entry does not specify a subclass (e.g., IgG), origin (human vs. animal), or route, so child concepts like IVIG/SCIG or specific immune globulins (anti-Rho(D), HBIG) would be inappropriate. The parent concepts such as general pharmaceutical products are too nonspecific. The abbreviation does not introduce new attributes and remains clinically equivalent."
371493002,Status of venous (large vessel) invasion by tumor (observable entity),Tumor board data element: status of major venous invasion,"This entry denotes a tumor board data element capturing the status of invasion of major venous vessels. The main concept is an Observable entity for venous large-vessel invasion status. It avoids adding result values or extent. 'Major venous' corresponds to large veins, and the focus excludes arteries/lymphatics. The broader parent (vascular invasion status) is less precise, and the finding concepts are not correct because this is a status field. SCTID 371493002 fits best."
438029003,Psychrobacter alimentarius (organism),Clinician documentation: Psychrobacter alimentarius (species),"This entry reflects clinician documentation that names the species Psychrobacter alimentarius, without any clinical attributes such as infection, specimen, or site. The main concept is the organism. Category: Organism. The precise code is 438029003 Psychrobacter alimentarius (organism). Parent concepts like Psychrobacter (organism) or Bacterium (organism) are too general, and siblings (other species) are incorrect. The word 'species' is a taxonomic descriptor and does not change the species-level organism mapping."
249628000,Anal finding (finding),Anal inspection finding,"The phrase conveys a finding localized to the anus noted upon inspection, without describing any specific abnormality. Main concept: anal-region clinical finding. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. Inspection as context does not alter the clinical meaning; it remains an unspecified anal finding, matching 249628000. Child concepts requiring a defined phenomenon are not supported, and parent/sibling concepts would be less precise regarding the site."
56742005,Irrigation of pancreatic tube (procedure),Pancreatic drainage tube flushed,"The entry specifies that a pancreatic drainage tube was flushed, with 'flushed' being synonymous with irrigated and 'drainage tube' a common descriptor for the pancreatic tube. The main concept is irrigation of a pancreatic tube, which is a Procedure and maps to SCTID 56742005. It does not introduce solution, indication, imaging guidance, or other attributes. A parent like generic drainage tube irrigation would be too broad, and siblings affecting other anatomical sites (e.g., biliary or gastric drains) or different device types are not supported by the wording."
275529004,History of congenital disease of hip (situation),Preoperative assessment: history of congenital hip disorder,"This preoperative note cites a history of congenital hip disorder, clearly a historical context rather than a current diagnosis. Attributes: past history, congenital etiology, hip site. It maps to a Situation with explicit context and matches SNOMED CT 275529004. Parent concepts without “congenital” are insufficiently specific; child concepts naming a particular congenital disorder would overspecify. “Disorder” functions as a synonym for “disease” here without altering the coding intent."
57503003,Secondary visual deviation (observable entity),Secondary strabismic deviation,"The term 'strabismic' situates the observation within strabismus testing while 'secondary' specifies the type of observed deviation. This remains an Observable entity and does not imply a strabismus disorder diagnosis. It is more exact than generic 'strabismic deviation' and avoids attributes like direction (eso/exo), magnitude, or etiology, making the given SNOMED concept the best fit."
731243004,Entire extrapulmonary lymph node of lung (body structure),Extrapulmonary lymph node—lung,"Main concept: an extrapulmonary lymph node associated with the lung. Attributes: extrapulmonary and lung association; the em dash is stylistic and does not affect meaning. SNOMED CT category: Body structure (Anatomical structure). SCTID 731243004 is the correct code. Parents like ‘lymph node of lung’ are overly broad, children such as specific hilar nodes add detail not present, and siblings like ‘intrapulmonary lymph node of lung’ conflict with the explicit extrapulmonary qualifier."
38413003,Product manufactured as otic dose form (product),Otic pharmaceutical product (manufactured dose form),"The main concept is a pharmaceutical product identified by the otic manufactured dose form. There are no added qualifiers such as specific dosage sub-form, ingredient, or therapeutic class. SNOMED CT category: Product. This is best coded as SCTID 38413003 because it specifies an otic dose-form product; coding to a parent like ‘Pharmaceutical product’ would be too broad, and coding to a sibling/child such as ‘Otic drops product’ would be too narrow and not stated. The synonym phrase ‘pharmaceutical product’ and ‘manufactured dose form’ are standard and do not change the intended concept."
223796002,Dublin (geographic location),"Dublin, Republic of Ireland","The entry designates Dublin with a formal country name, clearly indicating the city in Ireland. It falls under the SNOMED CT Location hierarchy as a Geographic location. SCTID 223796002 is the precise code for Dublin (geographic location). Mapping to the parent country concept would be too broad, and sibling cities named Dublin in other countries are eliminated by the country qualifier. The phrasing is a synonymal country description without changing the concept."
223802000,Leinster (geographic location),"Follow-up location: Leinster, Ireland",The location for follow-up is specified as the Irish province of Leinster; the entry's codable element is the place name. Category: Geographic location. This precisely fits 223802000 and does not default to the parent (Ireland) or to narrower county concepts. The context word 'Follow-up' does not introduce attributes altering the location concept.
473415003,Intrauterine contraceptive device submitted as specimen (specimen),Specimen: intrauterine contraceptive device,"The entry declares the specimen type as an intrauterine contraceptive device, squarely a Specimen concept. SCTID 473415003 is the precise code since it denotes an IUD that is submitted as a specimen. More generic parents (e.g., “Device specimen”) fail to capture the intrauterine contraceptive nature, and procedure or device presence findings would be incorrect domains. The rewording as “Specimen: …” is a contextual framing used in reports and does not alter the underlying concept."
223919002,County Antrim (geographic location),Geographic location: County Antrim,"This entry frames the concept explicitly as a geographic location, naming County Antrim. The main concept is the place name, with 'Geographic location' only serving as contextual labeling. Category: Geographic location (Location). The content is fully consistent with SCTID 223919002. More general parents like Northern Ireland would be less specific, and sibling entities like other counties or towns are not suggested by this wording. The context label does not introduce additional coded attributes."
399083008,Hsieh projection (qualifier value),Hsieh projection,"The entry explicitly names the radiographic projection as “Hsieh projection,” which is the exact preferred term for the SNOMED CT qualifier value concept. The main medical concept is a specific imaging projection used in radiography; no body site, laterality, severity, or timing is stated. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. This is the most precise match because it identifies the named projection itself rather than a generic projection or a different view. A parent such as “Radiographic projection (qualifier value)” would be too generic, and siblings (other named projections) would not match the wording. Using the preferred term ensures the code selection aligns exactly with SCTID 399083008."
1254695009,Exposure to exhaust gas in watercraft (event),Exposure to exhaust fumes while on watercraft,"This entry conveys that exhaust fumes exposure occurred while on a watercraft, directly matching the agent and setting required. The main concept is exposure; attributes are exhaust fumes and watercraft context. The SNOMED CT category is Event. 'Exhaust fumes' is interchangeable with exhaust gas in clinical documentation. It avoids adding injury, symptoms, or intent, so the specific SCTID 1254695009 is the correct and most precise representation."
214570005,Fire starting in motor vehicle while in motion on road (event),Discharge summary: event was a fire starting in a motor vehicle while in motion on a road,The discharge summary restates the event: a fire starting in a motor vehicle while the vehicle was in motion on a road. Category: Event. This exactly matches SCTID 214570005. Parent concepts that do not include motion/road or siblings that change the location/motion context are not as accurate. No extra attributes like cause or outcomes are present.
409528009,Surgical face mask (physical object),Supplies: surgical face mask,"The entry names a supply item, specifically a surgical face mask, which is a Physical object and maps to SCTID 409528009. 'Supplies' is a context label and does not introduce procedural or usage attributes. The term differentiates it from generic face masks and other mask devices (respirators, oxygen masks), ensuring the surgical face mask is the exact object referenced. Therefore, the specific surgical face mask concept is appropriate."
425795004,Multiple organ dysfunction score (observable entity),Assessment: multiple organ dysfunction score,"This entry situates the concept within clinical assessment but still names the specific observable, the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It maps best to 425795004 because the focus is the score parameter itself. More general or alternate instruments (parents or siblings) would be less exact. No numeric result, severity, or temporal attributes are stated."
90404003,Fibrinogen Barcelona I (substance),Fibrinogen Barcelona-1,"The hyphenated numeral 'Barcelona-1' is a stylistic variation commonly used for named protein variants and refers to the same entity as Barcelona I. No additional properties are introduced. This maps to the SNOMED CT Substance concept SCTID 90404003 Fibrinogen Barcelona I (substance). Broader concepts like Fibrinogen (substance) or any other fibrinogen variant are less specific, and disorder-level terms are not implied by this entry. Thus, the exact named substance is the appropriate selection."
249512003,Desire for stool (finding),Sense of needing to pass a stool,"The phrase captures the sense of needing to pass a stool, i.e., desire for stool. This is a Clinical finding and corresponds to Desire for stool (finding), SCTID 249512003. No additional attributes (e.g., inability to defer, pain, straining) are present, which excludes more specific concepts like fecal urgency or tenesmus. The synonymy with the preferred term is clear and precise."
268391007,Disability assessment - mental (observable entity),Documentation label: mental disability assessment,"This labeling refers to the mental disability assessment concept, consistent with the Observable entity 'Disability assessment - mental' (268391007). No attributes like severity, timing, or causes are expressed. The parent 'Disability assessment' would be overly broad, and non-mental siblings are inappropriate. The wording is a safe paraphrase that preserves the exact concept and supports the same code."
12468001,Floor loading limit (qualifier value),Floor loading restriction,"The term “restriction” is synonymous with “limit” in this setting, describing the constraint on floor loading. This is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT and matches SCTID 12468001 because the restriction explicitly pertains to the floor. A generic “restriction” or “weight restriction” without floor reference would be less specific, and clinical findings about patient mobility or weight bearing are not the target. No additional attributes (e.g., amount, timing) are introduced, keeping the entry uniquely aligned to the concept."
33336008,"Matches, device (physical object)",Matches (physical object),"The term specifies matches as a physical object, consistent with the device hierarchy and uniquely matching SNOMED CT 33336008. Category: Physical object (Device). It avoids type specifications or usage context, so it does not map better to any parent, child, or sibling concept. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym of the preferred term."
215887006,"Aircraft collision while landing, occupant of military aircraft injured (event)",Patient injured as an occupant in a military aircraft collision during landing,"The entry frames the mechanism: collision during landing, involving a military aircraft, with the patient as an injured occupant. This matches the SNOMED CT Event code 215887006. It maintains the core attributes without adding details like aircraft subtype, specific collision object, or severity. Using 'patient' simply indicates the injured occupant and does not shift the concept to a disorder or finding. Parent or sibling concepts related to non-military aircraft, other flight phases, or crash rather than collision would be less accurate."
411565000,Budgerigar droppings diagnostic allergen extract (product),Melopsittacus undulatus droppings diagnostic allergen extract,"The phrase specifies the diagnostic allergen extract derived from droppings of Melopsittacus undulatus, the scientific name for budgerigar, making it a Product that maps to SCTID 411565000. Using the scientific name is a precise synonym for the species and does not alter the concept. Broader parent concepts (e.g., bird droppings allergen extract) lack species detail, while siblings (e.g., budgerigar feather extract or therapeutic extracts) have different source materials or use contexts, so they are less appropriate."
298444007,Passive range of cervical spine left lateral flexion (observable entity),Passive c-spine left lateral flexion range documented,"This expresses documentation of a passive range measure for the c-spine in left lateral flexion. The key attributes (passive, cervical spine, left lateral flexion) are present, categorizing it as an Observable entity and matching SCTID 298444007. It is more specific than general cervical PROM and excludes siblings such as right-side movement or active ROM. The shorthand 'c-spine' is a clinically accepted synonym for cervical spine."
124979002,Mitotic alteration (finding),Report indicates mitotic alteration,"This brief documentation conveys that a report identified a mitotic alteration, fitting the Clinical finding category. It aligns with SCTID 124979002 because it communicates a generic alteration in mitosis without additional attributes such as increased/decreased activity or atypical morphology. Parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling concepts would be too specific. The reporting context does not change the concept."
216395005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, church (environment)",Church was the location of the accident or poisoning,"This phrase identifies church as the location where an accident or poisoning happened, without adding mechanism or other details. The main concept is the environmental place-of-occurrence. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It best maps to 216395005, which specifically represents church as the place of occurrence for accident/poisoning. A broader parent concept would not capture the specificity, and sibling environments are not mentioned. The wording is equivalent and does not change the code."
223905002,Tyne and Wear (geographic location),Locality: Tyne and Wear,"This presents Tyne and Wear as the named locality, preserving the exact geographic place without implying any other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The most precise code is SCTID 223905002. Using a broader region or a specific city would misrepresent the scope of the entry."
223648006,Bulgaria (geographic location),Patient-reported: Bulgaria,"The context indicates a patient-reported value, but the concept itself is the country Bulgaria without further qualifiers. This maps to 223648006 |Bulgaria (geographic location)|. The entry does not assert residence, travel, birth location, or exposure, so it remains purely a geographic location. Parent concepts (Country) lack specificity, and siblings do not match. The contextual label does not change the coding target."
242289000,Accidental exposure to molluscicide (event),Accidental exposure to molluscicide substance,"The wording conveys an accidental exposure to a substance that is a molluscicide, avoiding any mention of route or harm. As a circumstance, this is an Event. SCTID 242289000 is the most accurate code, capturing accidental exposure to the specified agent class. Parent concepts like accidental exposure to pesticide would be overly general, and disorder concepts such as toxicity or poisoning are not indicated. The synonym 'molluscicide substance' is equivalent to 'molluscicide.'"
284558000,Power station (environment),Event site: power station,"Here, the site of the event is documented as a power station, expressing only the environment. This should be coded to SNOMED CT 284558000 Power station (environment). A broader environmental parent would reduce specificity, and sibling facilities like electrical substations are different contexts. No subtype or associated conditions are introduced, preserving the exact environment match."
215935006,"Fire on aircraft while landing, occupant of commercial aircraft in surface to air transport injured (event)",Commercial airliner occupant injured in aircraft fire while landing,"The entry specifies an occupant of a commercial airliner injured during an aircraft fire in the landing phase. Relevant attributes: on-board fire, landing phase, commercial aircraft occupancy, injury. This aligns with the Event concept 215935006. “Airliner” is a clinically safe synonym for commercial aircraft. Broader or phase-unspecified fire events are less precise; specifying passenger or crew would over-narrow the concept beyond what is stated."
269942002,"Ear, nose and throat swab taken (situation)","Specimen: ear, nose and throat swab—collected.","Framed as a specimen line, this indicates that the specimen type is an ear, nose and throat swab and that it has been collected. This is a completed-event Situation and fits SNOMED CT 269942002. It is more specific than a generic 'swab collected' and not narrower than single-site variants. No testing method or indication is added, and 'collected' is synonymous with 'taken' for the context, justifying the exact concept selection."
719170006,Partner well (situation),Partner well.,"The entry expresses the single concept that the patient's partner is well, without adding timing, severity, cause, or other attributes. The SNOMED CT concept is a Situation: 719170006 | Partner well (situation). This is the most precise match because it specifically captures the health status of the partner being well. Broader parent concepts like generic 'Well' or findings about the patient would be less precise, and sibling concepts referring to other relations (e.g., parent well, spouse well) or different states (e.g., partner unwell) would not fit. The minimal phrasing aligns exactly with the situation code and adds no extra qualifiers."
285401009,Water pressure (physical force),Water pressure,"The entry names the physical force exerted by water, with no qualifiers for magnitude, timing, location, or related conditions. This aligns with the SNOMED CT semantic tag Physical force and matches Water pressure (physical force) [285401009] exactly. More general parents such as Physical force or Pressure (physical force) lack the specification of the medium (water), and siblings like Air pressure or Fluid pressure are either different media or broader. No additional attributes are introduced, so this is the most precise code."
736387009,Major urologic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Resident sign-out: major urologic surgery inpatient plan of care,"This indicates that during sign-out, a plan of care for major urologic surgery in the inpatient setting is referenced. The artifact is a care plan; attributes are inpatient, urologic, and major surgery. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. 'Plan of care' is equivalent to 'care plan', keeping semantics unchanged. It maps to SCTID 736387009 rather than generic care plans or outpatient/minor variants."
282411005,Unit of physiological status and assessment (qualifier value),Units — physiological status and assessment,"The entry asserts that the units pertain to the physiological status and assessment domain, effectively naming the Qualifier value category. It does not imply any particular unit or measurement, maintaining neutrality. The code 282411005 matches precisely. Parents like generic unit-of-measure concepts would be broader, and children specifying concrete units are excluded by the wording. The em dash style does not change the semantic content."
468761003,"Endoscopic light source, line-powered (physical object)",Wall-outlet powered endoscopic lighting device,"The main concept is an endoscopic lighting device powered via wall outlet (mains), i.e., line-powered. Category: Physical object. “Lighting device” is synonymous with light source in this context. The wall-outlet power specification makes 468761003 the best match, excluding battery-powered variants and avoiding extra details that would require a different code."
1352652005,Union for International Cancer Control ypT2a1 (qualifier value),Final UICC TNM T (post-therapy): ypT2a1,"The entry denotes the final UICC TNM T category after therapy and specifies the exact value ypT2a1. The main concept is the UICC post-treatment pathological T qualifier, with no N or M categories and no tumor site specified. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value; SCTID 1352652005 precisely matches UICC ypT2a1. The wording 'post-therapy' is clinically equivalent to the 'y' component in yp and does not introduce new attributes. Parent categories like generic UICC ypT or sibling values such as UICC ypT2a or UICC pT2a1 would not be as precise."
1306623000,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Media: extraoral right facial half photograph—lips relaxed; teeth in centric occlusion.,"This media entry documents a photographic extraoral image of the right half of the face with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion. The category is Record artifact. 'Right facial half' is synonymous with 'right half of face.' The inclusion of both lip posture and occlusion makes SCTID 1306623000 the exact match. Parent or sibling concepts with missing or different attributes (e.g., full-face, intraoral, left side, smile/open mouth, alternative occlusal positions) are excluded."
284765005,Public lavatory (environment),Public ablution toilet facility,"‘Ablution’ commonly refers to washing arrangements, but paired with ‘toilet facility’ and ‘public,’ this denotes a public lavatory environment. It is an Environment/geographical location concept and adds no clinical attributes. The synonym set still conveys a public toilet facility. Therefore, SNOMED CT 284765005 Public lavatory (environment) is the precise code, whereas parent concepts like generic ablution area or unrelated siblings (e.g., handwashing-only areas) are not indicated."
4281000179108,Triage form (record artifact),Triage sheet,"The concept here is the triage sheet, a commonly used synonym for a triage form and thus a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. No extra attributes are specified beyond the document type. SCTID 4281000179108 Triage form (record artifact) is the most precise match because a ‘sheet’ in clinical documentation is treated as a form artifact. Parent concepts like generic forms would be too broad, and siblings like triage notes or procedural triage would misclassify the entry. The synonym “sheet” is clinically equivalent to “form” in this context and does not alter code selection."
1228921001,American Joint Committee on Cancer ypT3d (qualifier value),Prior staging in chart: AJCC ypT3d,"This historical note specifies that prior staging recorded was AJCC ypT3d. The main concept is AJCC ypT3d, the post-treatment pathologic T category. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Qualifier value. SCTID 1228921001 is the exact code for AJCC ypT3d. Parents like AJCC ypT3 omit the 'd' subclass detail, and siblings like AJCC cT3d or AJCC pT3d represent different contexts (clinical or untreated pathologic), which are not indicated. No other attributes (site, severity, etc.) are introduced, keeping the entry uniquely codable to the given concept."
48103003,Freezing (physical force),Force type—freezing,"The phrase identifies the type of physical force as freezing without attaching clinical outcomes or contextual attributes. In SNOMED CT, this maps precisely to Freezing (physical force) [48103003] within the Event hierarchy. Selecting a parent Physical force would be nonspecific, and choosing siblings such as Cold or Cooling would mischaracterize the mechanism. The term 'force type' functions as a descriptive label, not an introduction of a different concept."
708544001,Patient heating and or cooling system pad (physical object),Thermal system pad for patient heat/cool,"The wording refers to a pad used in a thermal system to heat or cool a patient, indicating a physical object for temperature management. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It aligns with “Patient heating and or cooling system pad” because it specifies pad form, system context, and patient application. Parent device classes are broader and lack pad detail, while siblings that indicate blankets or mattress overlays are different objects. “Thermal” and “heat/cool” are clinically equivalent descriptors for the same function and do not alter code selection."
361109000,Entire lymph node of lower limb (body structure),Ultrasound focus: lower limb lymph node,"This contextual entry designates the lymph node in the lower limb as the anatomical focus for imaging but does not add any imaging findings. It is a Body structure reference, mapping cleanly to SCTID 361109000 (Entire lymph node of lower limb). The term is more specific than an unspecified lymph node due to the site, while avoiding subregional specificity and laterality that would move it to a child or sibling concept. The 'Ultrasound focus' prefix is contextual and does not alter the underlying anatomical target."
787959001,Paenibacillus pabuli or Paenibacillus polymyxa (finding),Follow-up: still characterized as Paenibacillus pabuli or P. polymyxa,"This follow-up note maintains that the organism is characterized as either Paenibacillus pabuli or Paenibacillus polymyxa. It remains a Clinical finding and matches SCTID 787959001. A child concept for a single species would not be supported, and a parent genus concept would be less specific. The follow-up context is narrative and does not add attributes like severity, timing detail, site, or a disorder diagnosis."
263910004,Trilobar (qualifier value),Tri-lobed,"The entry uses the synonym “Tri-lobed,” which is clinically equivalent to “Trilobar,” both meaning three-lobed morphology. The main concept is a pure morphological qualifier with no object specified. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 263910004 is the correct code, as this phrase denotes exactly three lobes. Parent concepts (e.g., generic shape) are less specific, and siblings like uni-, bi-, or quadrilobed do not match. The synonym does not add or change attributes."
1351681008,Delorazepam (substance),Formulary substance entry — delorazepam,"This entry refers to delorazepam by its substance name within a formulary context, but does not provide product formulation, strength, or dosing information. It should be coded as a Substance, specifically Delorazepam (substance), SCTID 1351681008. Mapping to a pharmaceutical product concept would be less precise due to absent product attributes. Parent drug class concepts would be too broad, and sibling substances are distinct compounds."
309548003,Breast duct specimen (specimen),Breast duct sample.,"“Sample” is a common synonym for specimen in clinical documentation, and specifying “breast duct” makes it directly codable to SNOMED CT 309548003 (Breast duct specimen), Specimen. No extra attributes like laterality, method, or content type are present. Parent concepts such as “breast sample/specimen” would be too broad, while child concepts (e.g., ductal fluid or biopsy specimen) would introduce specificity not stated here."
242084000,Injured by moving object in or near railway vehicle (event),Occupational note: injured by a moving object in or near a railway vehicle.,"The content conveys injury by a moving object with context 'in or near a railway vehicle,' framed within an occupational note but without changing the mechanism. Category: Event. SCTID 242084000 fits exactly. A more generic parent lacks the railway vehicle qualifier, and siblings such as 'injured by moving object in or near road vehicle' or 'struck by railway vehicle' are not appropriate. The occupational context does not add clinical attributes that would alter coding."
161533003,History of abdominal hernia (situation),Past history of abdominal hernia recorded,"The entry communicates that a past abdominal hernia is recorded, clearly indicating history rather than current status. The concept is a historical situation. It fits the SNOMED category Situation with explicit context and maps to “History of abdominal hernia (situation)” 161533003. The wording sticks to the abdominal region without further specification, making it more precise than generic hernia history and not specific enough to use a child concept."
38258006,Hyperalimentation formula for inflammatory bowel disease (finding),Uses hyperalimentation feeding formula for IBD,"The entry conveys the use of a hyperalimentation feeding formula intended for inflammatory bowel disease, which fits the Clinical finding SCTID 38258006. 'Feeding formula' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'formula' here and does not introduce route, type, or composition, maintaining the same coding. It is not a generic hyperalimentation formula (parent) and avoids sibling/child specificity like Crohn’s-only or UC-only products, or procedural nutrition codes."
258411007,Nasopharyngeal aspirate (specimen),Lab specimen received: nasopharyngeal aspirate,"This lab-receipt phrasing still refers strictly to the specimen type—nasopharyngeal aspirate—and therefore maps to Nasopharyngeal aspirate (specimen). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It does not imply any different collection method such as swabbing or washing, nor does it describe the procedure itself. Context of receipt does not alter the specimen concept."
265359007,Antireflux fundoplication using abdominal approach (procedure),Antireflux fundoplication—abdominal route,"This entry conveys an antireflux fundoplication and explicitly states the abdominal route, making it a Procedure. The hyphenated phrasing does not change semantics; it still indicates SCTID 265359007. It is more precise than the general fundoplication concept by specifying approach and does not imply laparoscopic/open or wrap type, so it does not map to child techniques. It excludes thoracic and other approaches, thus sibling codes are less appropriate."
256264000,Sycamore pollen (substance),Patient states: “sycamore pollen”,"This patient-reported mention is limited to the substance name, sycamore pollen, without asserting any reaction, diagnosis, or test result. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Substance concept Sycamore pollen (substance), SCTID 256264000. The context of patient statement does not change the ontology category or add attributes. Broader parents (Tree pollen) or disorder concepts (allergy to sycamore pollen) would not be appropriate. The term itself uniquely identifies the substance."
309896007,Tertiary referral hospital (environment),Tertiary hospital,"“Tertiary hospital” is shorthand commonly used to denote a tertiary referral hospital, indicating the environment as a high-level referral hospital. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It aligns with 309896007 rather than a parent “Hospital (environment)” because it conveys the tertiary-level designation. No child concepts such as specific departments or service lines are mentioned, and siblings like community or secondary hospitals are not suggested. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent and does not introduce extra attributes."
773448005,Psychiatric intensive care plan (record artifact),Intensive psychiatric care plan,"The wording reverses the adjective order but clearly indicates a care plan for intensive psychiatric care, which is a documentation artifact. This maps to Psychiatric intensive care plan (record artifact), SCTID 773448005. Category: Record artifact. Parent or sibling concepts that omit either the psychiatric or the intensive element would be less precise. The rearrangement of terms is a valid paraphrase and preserves the exact meaning."
242886002,Assault by puncture wound (event),External cause: assault by puncture wound,"This wording places the event in external cause terminology, stating assault by puncture wound precisely. Category: Event. The correct code is 242886002. A parent assault event would be too general, and injury-only codes would represent the wound rather than the event. No added attributes (e.g., location, severity, timing) are present, and using “External cause” is conventional in injury reporting, not altering the underlying concept."
223799009,Kildare (geographic location),The specified place is Kildare,"This narrative states that the place in question is Kildare, with no added situational qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (geographic location). SCTID 223799009 best represents the geographic entity; coding to Ireland or County Kildare would be either too broad or a different concept. The wording is a paraphrase that maintains equivalence to the original concept."
278873008,Georgia state (geographic location),"Georgia, United States (state)","This entry identifies Georgia as a state within the United States, making the concept a geographic location. It corresponds precisely to Georgia state (geographic location) SCTID 278873008. The parent concept of general geographic location or U.S. state category would be less specific, and siblings like “Georgia (country)” are excluded by the explicit “United States”. No clinical or contextual attributes are added—only the identity of the state is conveyed."
223410008,Wallis and Futuna islands (geographic location),Origin field value: Wallis and Futuna islands,"Although 'Origin field value' provides context, the coded concept is solely the geographic islands. Main concept: Wallis and Futuna islands. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The entry corresponds exactly to SCTID 223410008 and does not imply a specific sub-island or a geopolitical entity, so related parent/child/sibling concepts are less accurate."
184873009,Social security claim report (record artifact),Social security benefits claim report,"This entry describes a report used for a social security benefits claim; 'benefits' clarifies the context of the claim without adding a specific benefit type. The main concept is a report artifact tied to a social security claim. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It precisely maps to Social security claim report (record artifact), SCTID 184873009. Parent record artifact categories are too generic, and sibling artifacts such as applications or determination letters are not indicated. The synonymic phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
223580003,Far east country (geographic location),Country classified under the Far East,"The phrase identifies a country classified within the Far East, consistent with SNOMED CT 223580003 Far east country (geographic location). The main concept is a country; the only attribute is geographic classification. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This avoids mapping to the parent Country without regional qualifier, and it does not indicate the region alone or any specific child country. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent and does not change code selection."
472872005,Swab from ultrasonic nebulizer (specimen),Lab specimen label: swab from ultrasonic nebulizer,"This label-style entry states the specimen is a swab from an ultrasonic nebulizer, which is exactly the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 472872005. The main concept is the specimen, with the attribute of device source being an ultrasonic nebulizer, and there are no added details that would change its meaning. It avoids generalization to a parent like “swab specimen” and does not narrow to specific parts of the nebulizer, preventing incorrect child mappings. The inclusion of “lab specimen label” is contextual only and does not modify the specimen type. Therefore, the most precise code selection is 472872005."
89316002,Static electricity (physical force),Electrostatic charges at rest,"Charges at rest explicitly define static electricity, a Physical force, and map directly to SCTID 89316002. Selecting a parent Physical force would be less specific, and siblings like Electric current (charges in motion) or Electric field refer to different physical constructs. The wording is a clear synonym for static electricity and adds no extra attributes that would require a different code."
397755005,Pulmonary artery catheter (physical object),Pulmonary artery catheter (PA catheter),"The entry provides the full term with its common abbreviation, both referring to the same device intended for the pulmonary artery. The category is Physical object. SCTID 397755005 is the most precise code because it denotes exactly this object. Generic parent catheter concepts would be too broad, while child variants that include particular features (e.g., balloon tips or measurement modalities) are not implied. Sibling catheter types target different vessels and would not fit."
77829008,Hypotaurine dehydrogenase (substance),Substance listing: hypotaurine dehydrogenase,"The phrase lists hypotaurine dehydrogenase explicitly as a substance, which matches the enzyme concept. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Substance category. There are no added qualifiers or actions, so it remains a pure substance mention. Broader classes like Enzyme or Dehydrogenase are less specific, and other oxidoreductases are distinct entities. The correct selection is Hypotaurine dehydrogenase (SCTID 77829008)."
121328002,Anabolic steroid identification (procedure),Drug identification: anabolic steroid,"This is a lab-style phrasing indicating drug identification and specifying the class as anabolic steroid, making it precise for SNOMED CT Procedure 'Anabolic steroid identification' (121328002). The category is Procedure. Without the anabolic steroid qualifier, a parent like generic drug identification would be chosen, but inclusion of the class narrows it correctly. Screening or measurement siblings are excluded because the entry emphasizes identification, not screening or quantifying."
1204492008,Cook Islands (geographic location),Cook Islands (geographic location),"This entry matches the preferred term and unambiguously expresses the geographic place. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). No additional qualifiers or context are provided, so the most precise match is Cook Islands (geographic location) [1204492008]. Parent concepts (e.g., region or country groupings) or child concepts (specific islands) are not indicated, making this exact code appropriate."
443946002,Quantitative measurement of mass concentration of glucose in peritoneal dialysis fluid specimen (procedure),Peritoneal dialysis bag fluid: quantitative glucose concentration.,"This wording refers to peritoneal dialysis bag fluid (the dialysate effluent) and specifies a quantitative glucose concentration measurement. The main concept is a procedure quantifying glucose mass concentration in PD fluid. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It aligns exactly with the concept: analyte is glucose, measurement is quantitative concentration (mass per volume implied), and the specimen is peritoneal dialysis fluid. Parent or sibling concepts that lack quantitative specification or use other fluids are not as precise. “Bag fluid” in the PD context is clinically equivalent to peritoneal dialysis fluid and does not alter coding."
216024009,"Collision of aircraft with bird, while in transit, occupant of commercial aircraft in surface to air transport injured (event)",In-flight bird strike on commercial aircraft with occupant injured,"The statement denotes a bird strike occurring on a commercial aircraft while in flight, resulting in injury to an occupant. The SNOMED CT category is Event. 'In-flight' gives the 'while in transit' attribute, and 'bird strike' equals 'collision of aircraft with bird.' Identifying the injured occupant and commercial aircraft makes SCTID 216024009 the precise match. Parent codes without injury or siblings involving non-commercial aircraft or non-flight phases do not fit the description."
447373006,Excision of nasal sinus and nasal turbinate (procedure),Nasal turbinate excision accompanying nasal sinus excision,"The wording conveys two excisions occurring together: one of the nasal turbinate and one of the nasal sinus. This is the combined procedure coded by SCTID 447373006. There is no mention of approach, laterality, or anatomic subtypes, so it does not call for child concepts, and it is not simply one structure, so siblings are less appropriate."
288461007,Children's playpark (environment),Site: children’s play park,"The entry names the site as a children’s play park; ‘site’ functions as a contextual label and does not add attributes like timing or cause. The SNOMED CT category is environment (Environment or geographical location). The precise code is 288461007 Children’s playpark (environment), as the term indicates a playpark meant for children. Using a generic park or playground would be less exact, and no specific subtype like school playground is indicated. The synonym retains the same meaning and code."
263842006,Phlyctenular (qualifier value),Observation modifier: phlyctenular,"This entry uses 'phlyctenular' as a modifier of an observation, making it clear that the term is a descriptive qualifier with no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It maps to 263842006. Concepts like phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis or phlyctenule would be incorrect since they imply a disorder or lesion not stated here."
246579001,Cranial nerve reflex (observable entity),Cranial nerve reflex (template field),"This contextual phrasing identifies the observable as a template field, but the core concept remains cranial nerve reflex as an observable property. It maps to Cranial nerve reflex (246579001) in the Observable entity hierarchy. The entry avoids specifying particular reflex types or any result/state, ruling out selection of parent general reflex or child-specific cranial reflex codes."
699711003,Defective mandibular complete denture (finding),Compromised lower complete denture,"This indicates a compromised (defective) state of a complete denture in the lower arch. Main concept: defective mandibular complete denture. Category: Clinical finding. 'Compromised' is used here as an equivalent to defective, not suggesting cause or severity. SCTID 699711003 is the most precise match, whereas parents lacking arch detail or siblings/children focused on maxillary, partial dentures, or specific defect characteristics would be less accurate."
242916006,Assault with cane (event),Mechanism of injury: assault with cane,"Within a mechanism-of-injury context, this entry identifies the event as an assault and specifies a cane as the instrument, without adding site or severity. It is an Event in SNOMED CT and maps most precisely to 'Assault with cane (event)' SCTID 242916006. Using 'Assault (event)' alone would be too general, and 'Assault with blunt object' would be less specific. The mechanism header is contextual and does not alter the concept; the core content 'assault with cane' remains equivalent."
272264002,Speech aid (physical object),Speech aid,"The entry names the device generically as a speech aid without adding any type, use, or other attributes. The main concept is a physical object used to aid speech. This fits SNOMED CT category Physical object, specifically Speech aid (physical object) SCTID 272264002. It is not more specific than any child device (e.g., electrolarynx or palatal lift), nor broader like the parent Device or Communication aid. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not introduce timing, severity, or causation, so the exact concept and code are the most precise match."
763083000,Geriatric screening declined (situation),Patient preference: decline geriatric screening,"This reflects the patient's preference to decline geriatric screening, articulating a refused geriatric screening. It is a Situation in SNOMED CT. The most accurate code is 'Geriatric screening declined (situation)' SCTID 763083000, as it encodes declining this particular screening. Parent concepts like general screening decline or broader patient preference are not specific enough, and no child concepts are implied. The phrase is a synonymous representation of decline without extra qualifiers."
1296623003,Structure of periosteum of left orbit (body structure),"Periosteum, left orbit","A concise, problem-list style entry that specifies periosteum at the left orbit, with laterality preserved. Category: Body structure. It exactly matches SCTID 1296623003, avoiding broader parent concepts (orbit or periosteum alone) and narrower child concepts (specific walls of the orbit). The punctuation does not introduce attributes; it remains a clear anatomical designation."
432829007,Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans (organism),Microbe: Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans,"The entry classifies the entity as a microbe and provides the specific species name Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, making the organism the main concept. In SNOMED CT this is an Organism, and the species code 432829007 is the most accurate match. The generic 'Microbe' or 'Bacterium' parents would be too broad, and other Exiguobacterium species are not correct. The wording contains no clinical attributes such as infection or location."
411602007,Mouse urine proteins diagnostic allergen extract (product),Use in diagnostics: mouse urine proteins allergen extract,"This entry declares diagnostic use and specifies the allergen extract source as mouse urine proteins, which aligns with the exact product concept. The main concept is the product; no additional attributes are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Product. Parent products without the source detail and siblings with different mouse materials are less appropriate. The phrasing is an acceptable synonym set for 411602007."
427569000,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation discontinued as per protocol (situation),"Per protocol, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was discontinued.","The entry clearly describes that CPR was discontinued and highlights that the decision was per protocol. The concept is a situation describing protocol-driven cessation of CPR. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 427569000 matches exactly since it encodes CPR discontinuation with the qualifier 'as per protocol.' Broader or sibling concepts (e.g., generic CPR cessation or CPR performed) are less suitable. The phrasing 'per protocol' is a direct synonym of 'as per protocol' without new attributes."
411921002,Olea europaea (pollen) specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Olive tree pollen-specific diagnostic allergen extract for skin testing,"The entry specifies a pollen-specific diagnostic allergen extract for olive tree and indicates skin testing use, maintaining product identity. Category: Product. It is neither an immunotherapy extract nor a procedure or result. The specificity to Olea europaea pollen ensures it fits 411921002 rather than a generic or sibling concept."
213007,Simian enterovirus 7 (organism),Simian enterovirus 7 specified,"The word 'specified' denotes identification of the organism name without asserting clinical presence or effects. The main concept remains the organism Simian enterovirus 7; category: Organism; code: 213007. Broader parents or different serotypes would not match the specificity. No additional attributes (infection, detection, timing, severity) are introduced, maintaining correct organism mapping."
445042000,Hospital outpatient progress report (record artifact),Hospital outpatient progress documentation note,"This describes a progress documentation note specific to hospital outpatient care, which is a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. “Documentation note” here is a paraphrase of a progress report/note and, coupled with “hospital outpatient,” maintains equivalence to SCTID 445042000. Parent concepts without setting detail or siblings like inpatient summary notes would be less accurate. No additional attributes are stated."
425402008,Geriatric depression score (observable entity),Score from the Geriatric Depression Scale,"This phrasing indicates the numerical outcome generated by the Geriatric Depression Scale, which is the observable entity intended by SCTID 425402008. It clearly excludes the procedure of administering the tool and any clinical interpretation. Parent concepts that generalize to depression scores are too broad, and child or sibling concepts referencing specific GDS versions (e.g., GDS-15) are not implied here."
764143004,Product containing sigma-1 receptor agonist (product),On medication list: product containing a sigma-1 receptor agonist,"This medication list context still centers on the product type—containing a sigma-1 receptor agonist—without adding dose, route, or specific ingredient. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). 'On medication list' is situational context and does not shift coding away from the product concept. A broader product parent would be imprecise; any child specifying named ingredients, strengths, or formulations would be overly specific. Siblings for different receptor targets or mechanisms would not align. SCTID 764143004 precisely reflects the entry."
425173008,Record extract (record artifact),Extract from health record,"This entry refers to an extract derived from the health record, denoting an excerpted document artifact. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, with the exact concept Record extract (record artifact) [425173008]. The wording does not introduce a specific subtype such as summary, letter, or report, making parent or sibling concepts less accurate. It is a direct synonym for the preferred term."
707543009,Pyrvinium (substance),Pharmacologic substance: pyrvinium,"Describing pyrvinium as a pharmacologic substance correctly situates it within the SNOMED CT Substance hierarchy and maps to Pyrvinium (substance), SCTID 707543009. The entry avoids product attributes (strength, form) and does not specify a salt form or therapeutic role beyond being a substance, making product or salt derivative concepts less suitable. The base substance code is thus the precise match."
257408008,Tire (qualifier value),Qualifier value selected: tyre,"This entry denotes 'tyre' (British English spelling) as the selected qualifier value, matching the concept Tire (qualifier value). The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. 'Tyre' is a clinically and semantically equivalent lexical variant of 'tire' and does not change the code selection. It does not imply a physical object or a patient complaint of fatigue, so object or finding codes would be less appropriate. The parent Qualifier value class is too broad, and any device/object child concepts would add specificity not present here."
224852004,Preparatory school (environment),College-preparatory school (environment),"The entry specifies an environment defined as a college-preparatory school, a recognized synonym for preparatory school, thereby aligning with SNOMED CT Preparatory school (environment), SCTID 224852004. This is within the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. The synonym does not add attributes like level or boarding status; parent School (environment) would be too general, and siblings (e.g., Secondary school, High school environments) are not appropriate given the explicit preparatory focus."
224638004,Apartment converted from house basement (environment),Home is an apartment made from the basement level of a house,"This indicates the home environment is an apartment made from a house’s basement level, which is the intent of SCTID 224638004. Main concept: converted basement apartment in a house. SNOMED CT category: Environment. More precise than general apartment or basement concepts and does not introduce extraneous attributes like building type other than 'house'. 'Made from' is an acceptable paraphrase of 'converted from'."
114471007,"Salmonella II 1,4,12,27:e,n,x:1,[5]7 (organism)","Microbiology: Salmonella II 1,4,12,27:e,n,x:1,[5]7","This entry lists the organism name in a microbiology documentation context, specifying Salmonella II 1,4,12,27:e,n,x:1,[5]7. The main concept is the organism identity; no attributes such as source or disease are provided. This belongs to the Organism hierarchy and maps to SCTID 114471007. Generic Salmonella parents are too broad, and other antigenic formulas are siblings that would not match. The context label ‘Microbiology’ does not affect coding."
216400006,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, garage, for car storage (environment)",Incident location (accident/poisoning): garage used for storing cars.,"The entry labels the incident location for an accident/poisoning as a garage used for storing cars, which directly corresponds to the environment concept 'garage, for car storage'. This fits the Environment or geographical location category. SCTID 216400006 is the most specific match. More general place-of-occurrence or different settings (e.g., driveway, workshop) would be inaccurate. The phrasing does not add cause, timing, or severity attributes."
128357008,Genus Rubulavirus (organism),Organism: Rubulavirus (genus),"The concept is the organism name Rubulavirus, explicitly marked as a genus, with no added clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This maps exactly to Genus Rubulavirus (128357008). Parent concepts are broader (family-level), and child concepts (species-level viruses) are more specific; the wording intentionally retains the genus level."
616622451000119100,History of cholestasis (situation),History of cholestasis,"The entry explicitly states a past occurrence of cholestasis, which sets the context as historical rather than current. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. This matches the concept “History of cholestasis (situation)” because it encodes a prior episode of cholestasis without implying current disease or adding cause, severity, or timing details. Mapping to the disorder “Cholestasis” would be inappropriate because the wording is not about a present finding; broader history-of parent concepts are less precise, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., pregnancy-related cholestasis) are not mentioned."
315436002,Born in Guinea Bissau (finding),Born in Guinea-Bissau,"The entry states the individual's birthplace as the country Guinea-Bissau, which directly matches the SNOMED CT concept Born in Guinea Bissau (finding), SCTID 315436002. This is a Clinical finding capturing country of birth. No additional attributes like date, nationality, ethnicity, or residence are introduced. Broader parent concepts such as Place of birth (finding) or Born in Africa would be less precise, and sibling or child concepts like Born in Guinea or Born in Bissau (city) would be incorrect or overly specific. The phrasing is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and selects the exact code."
428371002,Bismuth oxide (substance),Bismuth(3+) oxide,"This phrasing conveys the oxidation state of bismuth in the compound, meaning the same substance as bismuth(III) oxide. It represents a Substance with no additional properties like concentration, dosage form, or intended use. The best SNOMED CT match is Bismuth oxide (substance), SCTID 428371002, rather than a parent class of bismuth compounds or a sibling such as bismuth subnitrate. The synonym is chemically faithful to the same compound and keeps the code selection unchanged."
110968003,Fetal cytologic material (specimen),Cytology specimen—fetal cells,"The entry indicates a cytology specimen composed of fetal cells, specifying both cytologic nature and fetal origin. The main concept is fetal cytologic material as a specimen. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It matches Fetal cytologic material (specimen), SCTID 110968003, most precisely. More general parents (e.g., Cytologic material) omit the fetal attribute, while siblings like tissue specimens or amniotic fluid would add source/type not present. The wording is a semantically equivalent paraphrase; it does not introduce method, preparation, or source, so the code selection remains unchanged."
432059003,Specimen from uterus obtained by biopsy (specimen),Tissue specimen from uterus obtained by biopsy,"The phrase exactly mirrors the preferred term with synonymous wording, indicating a specimen (tissue) from the uterus via biopsy. Category: Specimen. It matches SCTID 432059003, and avoids additional attributes or narrower anatomy like endometrium or cervix, thereby not mapping better to child concepts. The synonym “tissue specimen” is standard and does not alter meaning."
1365818001,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror and corrected of left buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Mirror-viewed and corrected dental intraoral photograph — left buccal segment, centric occlusion.","The entry explicitly describes a mirror-viewed and corrected intraoral dental photograph of the left buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion, fitting the defined record artifact. Category: Record artifact. More general artifact labels omit essential attributes, and variants that imply other regions (right or anterior) or uncorrected mirror images would be siblings and therefore less appropriate. The terminology used is a direct synonym set and does not introduce any additional characteristics."
278185003,Chromosome status descriptors (qualifier value),Chromosomal status descriptor label,"This entry identifies a label for a descriptor tied to chromosomal status, implying a Qualifier value rather than a finding or measurement. It does not provide a particular status, thereby staying at the descriptor set level. Parent generic qualifiers and sibling non-chromosomal descriptors do not fit, and children with specific statuses would be too narrow. SCTID 278185003 is the appropriate selection."
411931009,Sambucus nigra specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Sambucus nigra allergen test extract (diagnostic),"Specifying Sambucus nigra and identifying it as an allergen extract for testing (diagnostic) maps directly to SNOMED CT Product 411931009. The entry does not add attributes like skin prick vs intradermal, concentration, or reporting results, so it avoids child concepts. A parent without species would be less precise, and siblings for non-nigra species or immunotherapy extracts would be inappropriate. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym of the preferred term."
284351005,School grounds (environment),Grounds of the school,"This is a synonymous formulation that names the environment as the grounds of the school, corresponding to School grounds (environment), SCTID 284351005. Main concept: environment/location; no event or clinical attributes are introduced. Category: Environment or geographical location. It is distinct from broader concepts referring to the entire school and does not imply any specific sub-area. The synonym retains the same meaning and code selection."
8334002,Structure of lumbar lymph node (body structure),Lymph node of lumbar region,"This synonym describes a lymph node situated in the lumbar region, which is clinically equivalent to 'lumbar lymph node.' The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 8334002 is appropriate because it encodes the specific node in the lumbar area. The entry avoids broader concepts like 'abdominal lymph node' and does not introduce attributes such as laterality, chain membership, or abnormality, so it should not map to parent or child concepts."
288521009,Town environment (environment),Setting identified as town environment,"This statement identifies the setting as a town environment and does not add other attributes like timing or exposure. In SNOMED CT, it belongs to the Environment category, with Town environment (environment) [288521009] being the precise match. 'Setting' is synonymous with environment, and naming 'town' avoids mapping to urban parent or city/rural siblings. The wording is clinically equivalent to the preferred term without altering code selection."
126254007,"Red blood cells, human, Adenine-Saline (AS-3) added (product)",AS-3 additive red blood cell product,"The wording identifies a red blood cell product with AS-3 additive, precisely matching Product concept 126254007. The AS-3 attribute differentiates it from the parent generic RBC product and alternative additive siblings (AS-1, AS-5). It does not introduce processing qualifiers (e.g., leukoreduced, irradiated), which would necessitate child concepts. The term “red blood cell product” is a synonymous way to denote the RBC blood component."
133928008,Community (social concept),Community referenced in patient narrative,"The phrase signifies mention of the concept ‘Community’ in narrative documentation, not a service, environment, or care delivery model. It matches SNOMED CT Community (social concept) 133928008 (Social concept). No additional attributes—such as residence, engagement, support, or acquisition—are included, avoiding misalignment with sibling concepts like Community dwelling or Community support services. The wording remains a pure reference to the social concept."
721915006,Admission request document (record artifact),Request for admission document,"The phrase identifies a document whose content is a request for admission. Main concept: an administrative document capturing an admission request. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It matches 721915006 since the artifact’s purpose is the admission request; parents like generic document are too broad, and siblings like referral letter or admission note are incorrect. ‘Request for admission’ is a direct paraphrase that does not add attributes and remains a document type."
1137358000,Piper (substance),Reference standard labeled: Piper,"The reference standard is labeled with the genus name Piper, referring to the genus-level botanical substance without species or preparation qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The correct SNOMED concept is Piper (substance), SCTID 1137358000. Parent classes like Botanical substance are too broad, and child species concepts would be too specific to match the label. Sibling genera would be incorrect. The labeling context does not introduce additional attributes; it maintains the genus-level identity of the substance."
395713002,"Surgical deep margin involved by malignant neoplasm, focal (finding)",I was told the deep surgical margin was focally positive for cancer,"This is a patient-reported formulation but still conveys the clinical finding that the deep surgical margin is focally positive for cancer. The concept remains deep margin involvement by malignant neoplasm, focal. Category: Clinical finding. It maps to the focal deep margin involvement concept and is not a general margin status nor another margin type. ""Positive for cancer"" equates to involvement by malignant neoplasm; the patient context does not alter the clinical meaning."
242293006,Accidental ingestion of seafood (event),Chart entry notes accidental ingestion of seafood,"This documentation indicates the chart records an accidental ingestion event involving seafood. The main concept is accidental ingestion of seafood, belonging to the Event category. SCTID 242293006 is the precise code. General accidental ingestion (parent) or exposure-to-seafood (sibling) would not match the specific ingestion and substance combination. The documentation context does not introduce attributes beyond the event itself."
421942001,Diadophis punctatus (organism),Diadophis punctatus,"The entry states the exact scientific species name, referring solely to the ring-necked snake. The main concept is a single organism at the species level, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 421942001 corresponds specifically to Diadophis punctatus and is the most precise match. Broader parent terms like Snake (organism), Colubridae (family), or Serpentes would be less specific, and child concepts such as subspecies of Diadophis punctatus would be overly specific. This phrasing contains no clinical events or exposures and therefore properly codes to the species-level organism concept."
4034004,"Closed reduction of facial fracture, except mandible (procedure)",Closed reduction of a facial fracture (excluding the mandible),"This statement denotes a closed reduction procedure limited to facial fractures and excludes the mandible, which is the defining scope of SCTID 4034004. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. No laterality, timing, fixation, or named bone is introduced, so child codes for individual facial bones are not better matches. Open reduction and mandibular procedures are ruled out by the wording, making 4034004 the most precise selection."
218209002,Overexposure to radioactive isotopes (event),Radionuclide exposure exceeding recommended limits,"This entry describes exposure exceeding recommended limits to radionuclides, a synonym for radioactive isotopes, which corresponds to overexposure. The main concept is an Event, best coded as SNOMED CT 218209002 Overexposure to radioactive isotopes (event). No cause, timing, or severity is added. Broader radiation exposure concepts lack isotope specificity; narrower child concepts with named isotopes or contexts are not indicated."
16087411000119102,History of excision of bilateral nipples (situation),Both nipples surgically excised (history),"This statement conveys that both nipples were removed via surgery in the past, satisfying the attributes of historical context, anatomical site, and bilateral laterality. It falls under the Situation category. SCTID 16087411000119102 is the most precise because it directly encodes history of excision of bilateral nipples. More general or unilateral history concepts would not reflect 'both'. Procedure codes or clinical findings such as absence of nipples are less suitable because the entry emphasizes past excision, not a current procedure or a non-contextualized finding."
224912002,Ninth floor (environment),Building level nine,"The entry states 'level nine' within a building, which is synonymous with the ninth floor. Main concept: ninth floor environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224912002 is appropriate because it specifically denotes the ninth floor. A parent concept for floors generally would be too broad; other levels like ten or eight are siblings. The phrase is a clinically safe paraphrase with no added qualifiers."
260365005,Heightened (qualifier value),Qualifier noted: heightened,"This explicitly identifies the data as a qualifier and uses 'heightened' as the value, with no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the correct code is Heightened (qualifier value) [260365005]. The context 'Qualifier noted' does not alter semantics. Sibling qualifiers are not invoked, so this entry remains uniquely codable to 260365005."
1335922001,Specimen from neck obtained by biopsy (specimen),Biopsy specimen from neck,"This entry states a specimen collected via biopsy and specifies the neck as the source, which matches the defined attributes of SCTID 1335922001. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It is more precise than the parent concepts that only include site or method alone. It avoids child concepts that would identify a specific structure (e.g., neck skin, lymph node). The synonym order (“biopsy specimen from neck”) is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
464848003,Satellite external beam radiation therapy radionuclide system collimator (physical object),Satellite EBRT radioisotope system beam collimator,"The entry specifies a beam collimator for a satellite external beam radiation therapy system employing a radioisotope (radionuclide) source. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. 'Radioisotope' is a clinically safe synonym for 'radionuclide,' and EBRT is a standard abbreviation; both do not alter the code choice. This uniquely maps to SCTID 464848003 due to the satellite and external beam therapy context. Parent concepts lacking these qualifiers and siblings like linac collimators are less appropriate."
86508006,High humidity (physical force),High humidity observed,"“Observed” indicates recognition of the condition without quantifying it or framing it as a patient exposure, preserving the focus on the environmental physical force. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force; the exact code is High humidity (physical force) [86508006]. Generic parent concepts lack the high attribute, and siblings representing other humidity levels are inconsistent with the wording. No additional attributes such as duration or causation are introduced."
1269574005,American Joint Committee on Cancer ycTis(Paget) (qualifier value),AJCC staging qualifier ycTis (Paget),"The entry explicitly labels this as an AJCC staging qualifier and specifies 'ycTis (Paget)', i.e., clinical post-therapy Tis with the Paget subtype. The main concept is the AJCC ycTis(Paget) category used for staging. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It precisely corresponds to SCTID 1269574005 because it conveys the yc context and the specific Paget subtype. Parent concepts like generic AJCC Tis or sibling concepts like cTis(Paget) or ypTis(Paget) are less suitable given the explicit 'yc' and 'Paget' wording. The paraphrase does not introduce any additional attributes."
697988001,Soft stool specimen (specimen),Lab record: soft stool specimen,"This entry documents a lab record identifying a stool specimen of soft consistency. The main concept is a specimen, with the attribute 'soft.' The specific SNOMED CT match is Soft stool specimen (specimen), SCTID 697988001. A parent 'stool specimen' would omit the consistency and be less specific, while sibling concepts with formed or watery consistency would not match. The lab context does not add clinical attributes to the specimen itself."
1336209008,Mutation of untranslated region (finding),"Patient statement: ""mutation in the untranslated region""","A patient-reported phrasing still clearly denotes a mutation situated in the UTR, without introducing causal, severity, or gene-specific attributes. Category: Clinical finding. The appropriate code is Mutation of untranslated region (finding), SCTID 1336209008. Broader gene mutation concepts are not as precise, and child concepts for 5′ or 3′ UTR would add specificity not present here. The quoted wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
223992005,Falkland islands (geographic location),Falkland Islands noted in the chart,"The statement indicates that 'Falkland Islands' appears in documentation, but the only codable concept is the geographic location itself. The main concept is the place, categorized under Location (geographic location). No added attributes like residency, visit, or event are asserted, hence alternative context-specific findings or procedures are inappropriate. It does not refer to a child concept (e.g., East/West Falkland) or a parent concept. SCTID 223992005 is the exact match."
216390000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, public building (environment)",Scene of event recorded as public building.,"This wording identifies the 'scene of event' for the accident/poisoning as a public building, aligning directly with the place-of-occurrence concept SCTID 216390000. No additional attributes are conveyed. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. Alternatives like 'public place' or specific types (hospital, library) are not mentioned, so the general 'public building' concept remains the most accurate selection."
233119007,Unifocalization operation (procedure),Primary procedure: unifocalization,"Stating 'primary procedure' establishes context that the named intervention was the main operation performed, but adds no clinical attributes beyond naming the procedure. The SNOMED category is Procedure, and code 233119007 aligns exactly with unifocalization operation. Parent concepts would be too broad, and child/sibling concepts with anatomical or technical qualifiers are not supported by the text."
439579002,Urine collection pad (physical object),Urine collection pad packaged with home kit,"Packaging context identifies the included device as a urine collection pad, keeping the focus on the specific physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 439579002 is the precise match since it denotes a urine collection pad. Parent categories like general specimen devices are too broad, and siblings (bags, bottles) do not match the pad format. The note about packaging is contextual and does not introduce attributes changing the device concept."
423679008,Crax rubra (organism),Organism name: Crax rubra,"The entry states the organism name as Crax rubra, which is the species-level designation for the great curassow. It falls under the SNOMED CT Organism category and maps directly to SCTID 423679008. The phrasing does not add qualifiers or shift scope to a broader genus or different species, maintaining a clear, uniquely codable reference to the intended species."
416253002,Post-anesthesia care unit record (record artifact),Post-anesthesia care unit patient record,"This entry refers to the patient’s record from the post-anesthesia care unit, i.e., the PACU record artifact. It does not add information about content, timing, or authorship. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It best maps to 416253002 because it specifies the care unit. Parent concepts like generic patient records lack PACU specificity, and sibling concepts that denote specific document types (e.g., notes, reports) would be overly narrow compared with the intended record-level artifact."
305240002,Admission by intensive care specialist (procedure),Admitting consultant: critical care specialist,"This wording identifies the admitting consultant as a critical care specialist, synonymous with an intensive care specialist, thereby describing the admission procedure by that specialty. Classified as a Procedure, it maps to SCTID 305240002. More general admission codes lack the provider specificity, and concepts focused on ICU destination or consultation would miscode the entry since it clearly centers on admission by the intensivist."
414298005,Full spectrum color (qualifier value),Color value noted as full spectrum,"This phrasing indicates the recorded color value is full spectrum, which is a Qualifier value. The main concept is a color attribute, and the precise SNOMED code is Full spectrum color (414298005). Parent concepts that only indicate color generally are too broad, and any sibling that names a specific color or unrelated property would be incorrect. The wording introduces no additional clinical attributes."
1367749001,Malachite green stain technique (qualifier value),Report notes malachite green stain technique,"This narrative indicates a report documenting the malachite green stain technique, with no further attributes such as specimen or findings. The main concept captured is the stain technique; SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The accurate code is Malachite green stain technique (1367749001). A general staining technique qualifier would be insufficiently specific, and siblings (e.g., Gram stain) would mismatch. The phrasing ‘report notes’ is contextual and does not alter the underlying technique concept."
1156563002,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of endometrium at parametrial surgical margin in hysterectomy specimen (observable entity),Presence of primary malignant endometrial neoplasm at parametrial surgical margin in hysterectomy specimen,"This entry expresses an observable property—the presence of a primary malignant endometrial neoplasm at the parametrial surgical margin in a hysterectomy specimen. Concepts: primary malignant endometrial neoplasm, parametrial surgical margin, hysterectomy specimen, presence. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 1156563002 is the exact code because it captures this specific margin assessment. Parent or sibling observables that generalize the margin or choose another margin site would not match the wording. The phrasing avoids result values and maintains semantic equivalence to the preferred term."
2969000,Anatomical space structure (body structure),Anatomical space structure documented,"The entry documents the presence of an anatomical space structure without qualifiers, aligning with SNOMED CT 2969000. No site, laterality, severity, or causal details are included. The category is Body structure. Selecting a parent concept would lose the specific 'space' aspect, while choosing any child space would over-specify. Documentation context does not change the code; the term remains equivalent to the anatomical space structure."
840665003,Fat and oil requirement (observable entity),Dietary fat and oil requirement,"This entry denotes the required amount of fats and oils in the diet, making the main concept a nutrient requirement. It is an Observable entity because it captures a value to be observed or assessed. The addition of “dietary” clarifies context without changing meaning, so Fat and oil requirement (840665003) is the most precise match. Choosing a parent like overall dietary requirement would be too broad, while selecting siblings such as fat intake or dietary fat recommendation would shift to consumption or guidance rather than requirement. No extra attributes (timing, severity, cause) are introduced."
721963009,Order (record artifact),Order on file,"This phrase specifies that an order exists in the patient’s file, emphasizing the presence of the artifact without further attributes or type. The concept belongs to the Record artifact category. The correct SNOMED CT code is 721963009 Order (record artifact). It would be inappropriate to map to children like Laboratory test order or Imaging order because no domain is indicated, and the parent Record artifact is overly broad. The wording is a synonym that keeps the same artifact semantics."
725956001,Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring report (record artifact),Ambulatory BP monitoring report pending review,"This entry conveys that the ABPM report artifact exists and awaits review, affirming its nature as a document. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 725956001 is the most precise code, representing the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring report. Generic report codes would be too broad, and the ABPM procedure concept would be incorrect since this is about documentation. The phrase adds no clinical content such as results or duration, preserving the exact artifact mapping."
788300000,Product containing 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (product),Diagnostic report mention: product containing CMIT,"While framed as a report mention, the essential content is a product containing CMIT (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), aligning exactly with SCTID 788300000. Category: Product. No additional attributes like adverse effect, mixture, or concentration are implied. Substance-only or sibling product concepts would be less appropriate given the explicitly stated ingredient-in-product relationship."
286626001,Live donor allogeneic transplant kidney (substance),Allogeneic living-donor transplant kidney,"This text describes a transplant kidney that is an allogeneic graft sourced from a living donor. The focus remains on the organ graft (substance) rather than on a surgical procedure or clinical finding. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The combination of “allogeneic” and “living-donor” matches the specificity of 286626001. Using a parent code for allogeneic kidney without donor type would be less accurate, and sibling codes for cadaveric donor or xenogeneic would be inappropriate."
1287981006,Employment status of partner (observable entity),Partner employment status observation,"The term frames the partner’s employment status as an observation to be captured, not a specific outcome. The main concept is the observable data element: employment status with the subject designated as the partner. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It does not generalize to any person’s employment status (parent) nor shift to patient or spouse (siblings). Because no state like employed or unemployed is included, child value concepts are not triggered."
370108001,Extrahepatic bile duct cytologic material (specimen),Extrahepatic bile duct cell specimen,"This entry conveys that the specimen consists of cells (cytology) and the source site is the extrahepatic portion of the bile duct, without introducing method or diagnosis. The main concept is a cytologic specimen from the extrahepatic bile duct, placing it in the Specimen category. SCTID 370108001 exactly matches this description. More general parents omit the extrahepatic detail, while siblings such as intrahepatic bile duct cell specimens or histology/tissue specimens would misrepresent the site or specimen type. The synonym “cell specimen” is equivalent to cytologic material in clinical documentation."
1371684001,Combined specimen from swab of rectum and vaginal introitus (specimen),Single swab sample obtained from both rectum and vaginal introitus.,"This description emphasizes that one swab sample was used to collect material from two sites: rectum and vaginal introitus, reflecting a combined specimen. It captures the specimen type (swab), the combined two-site collection, and the exact anatomical locations, which corresponds to SNOMED CT Specimen 'Combined specimen from swab of rectum and vaginal introitus' (1371684001). A separate rectal or vaginal introitus swab would be different concepts, and broader combined-site concepts would lack specificity. The term 'sample' is commonly used interchangeably with 'specimen' in clinical documentation and does not change the intended coding."
55027006,Dermacentor reticulatus (organism),Tick species: Dermacentor reticulatus,"This entry names the tick species precisely as Dermacentor reticulatus, a specific Organism. The correct SNOMED CT concept is Dermacentor reticulatus (organism), SCTID 55027006. The phrase does not introduce stage, sex, vector function, or clinical context beyond naming the species. More general tick concepts or the genus Dermacentor would be less exact, and alternatives like D. marginatus or D. variabilis would be incorrect."
272895003,BL18 (body structure),UB18,"UB18 uses the standard abbreviation UB for Urinary Bladder and denotes the same acupuncture point as BL18. Category: Body structure. This is a clinically accepted synonym for BL18 and matches SNOMED CT 272895003 precisely, not a generic Urinary Bladder acupoint or the meridian itself. It does not introduce attributes or suggest a different location; hence parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate."
224038000,Alabama (geographic location),Alabama (state),"“Alabama (state)” specifies the type of geographic entity, ensuring it refers to the U.S. state rather than any non-geographic usage. SNOMED CT category is Location → Geographical location, with precise mapping to Alabama (geographic location) [224038000]. This excludes broader country-level parents and more specific intra-state places. The “(state)” qualifier is an equivalent synonym for the same entity."
23931000087109,Narcotic addiction medicine specialty (qualifier value),Discharge summary specialty: narcotic addiction medicine,"This indicates the specialty noted in the discharge summary is narcotic addiction medicine, which maps to the qualifier value (23931000087109). The main concept is the specialty designation, with 'discharge summary' being documentation context. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It is not representing a disorder or procedure, and no organizational unit is implied beyond the specialty name. Parent or sibling specialties would be less precise given the 'narcotic' specificity."
1290090000,Ground fissure (environment),EMS run sheet: ground fissure,"This EMS documentation indicates the environmental scene feature is a ground fissure without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. Ground fissure (environment) [1290090000] is the precise match; parent concepts lack specificity, and different environmental features would be inaccurate descriptors."
120713006,Antibody to Human parainfluenza virus 2 (substance),Coding term: Antibody to human parainfluenza virus type 2,"This entry explicitly names the antibody directed to HPIV-2 and does not specify immunoglobulin class, test result, or procedural context, keeping it as a pure substance reference. The main concept is the HPIV-2-targeted antibody; attributes include human host and type 2 specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It is a precise match for SCTID 120713006, not a parent (broader parainfluenza antibodies), not a child (Ig subclass), and not a sibling (other HPIV types)."
1187206009,Cayman Islands (geographic location),Listed location: Cayman Islands,"The phrase indicates that the listed place is “Cayman Islands,” which is a geographic location. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Location, and the precise concept is Cayman Islands (geographic location), SCTID 1187206009. The entry does not introduce more specific localities or wider regions, so neither parent nor child concepts fit better. The contextual label does not alter the semantic target: the territory itself."
702859005,Gastroenterology clinic (environment),GI clinic,"This states the environment as a gastroenterology clinic using the standard abbreviation GI. SNOMED CT category: Environment. “GI clinic” is a widely accepted synonym for gastroenterology clinic and adds no attributes (such as outpatient vs inpatient, pediatric vs adult). Therefore 702859005 is the precise match; a generic clinic parent would be too unspecific, and sibling concepts like gastroenterology department are not indicated because the term explicitly says clinic."
219194004,Assault by strangulation (event),Forensic exam note: assault by strangulation,"Documented in a forensic exam, the event described is assault by strangulation, aligning directly with SCTID 219194004. Category: Event. The forensic context does not alter the underlying concept, and no additional attributes (e.g., timing, severity, or mechanism subtype) are introduced. It is more specific than Assault (event) and distinct from non-assault strangulation, making 219194004 the precise match."
242041001,Emotional abuse of elderly person (event),Emotional abuse of elderly person,"The entry explicitly states emotional abuse directed at an elderly person, specifying both the abuse type (emotional) and the victim age group (elderly). The SNOMED CT category is Event. This is a direct lexical match to Emotional abuse of elderly person (event) 242041001. Broader parent concepts like Emotional abuse (event) or Elder abuse unspecified would be less precise because they omit the elderly victim qualifier or the abuse subtype. Sibling or child concepts such as physical or sexual abuse of elderly person do not match the emotional modality indicated here."
130060002,Isoflavone 2'-hydroxylase (substance),Isoflavone 2' hydroxylase,"This spelling variant omits the second hyphen but still unambiguously identifies the enzyme isoflavone 2' hydroxylase. No additional attributes (such as levels, function, deficiency, or association) are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with SCTID 130060002 as the most precise match. Using a broader parent like ""isoflavone hydroxylase"" would be less specific, and sibling concepts acting at other positions are not indicated. The spacing variation does not alter the semantic identity of the enzyme."
242871008,Assault by land-mine (event),Triaged as assault by land mine,"The text records the triage designation but the core concept is the event “assault by land mine,” precisely matching SNOMED CT Assault by land-mine (event) [242871008] in the Event hierarchy. It avoids adding injury, location, timing, or severity attributes. Parent Assault (event) would be less specific, and siblings like Assault by firearm or blunt object are incorrect. The phrase remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term for coding."
285550001,Does elevate soft palate (finding),Able to elevate soft palate,"This phrasing expresses the capability to elevate the soft palate, which is the core of the finding. It is a Clinical finding indicating that palatal elevation is achievable. The SNOMED concept 'Does elevate soft palate (finding)' is the most precise match because it encodes the presence of elevation. More general parent concepts would not capture the specific action, and alternatives implying absence or other qualities (e.g., symmetry) are not appropriate. 'Able to elevate' is synonymous with 'does elevate' and does not introduce additional attributes."
421501008,Subfamily Gasterophilinae (organism),History lists Gasterophilinae subfamily (organism) as identified taxon,"The central concept is the identified organism taxon at the subfamily ""Gasterophilinae."" The historical context does not add clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The best code is Subfamily Gasterophilinae (organism) (SCTID 421501008). Parent family or child genus/species codes would misalign with the explicitly stated subfamily rank. The wording is equivalent to the preferred term with no change in code selection."
411816004,Aureobasidium pullulans diagnostic allergen extract (product),Mold panel included Aureobasidium pullulans diagnostic allergen extract,"This conveys that the diagnostic allergen extract from Aureobasidium pullulans was part of a panel, preserving the product identity. The main concept remains a pharmaceutical/biologic diagnostic allergen extract, matched to SNOMED CT SCTID 411816004. Parent diagnostic extract concepts lack organism specificity; sibling entries for other fungi or therapeutic extracts would not fit. The panel context does not introduce attributes of dose, route, or results, and the explicit diagnostic allergen extract wording ensures unique mapping to the A. pullulans diagnostic product."
465230007,Assistive tool fixation device (physical object),Assistive tool fixation device,"The entry states the exact physical object concept: an assistive tool fixation device. No attributes such as type, location, timing, or condition are added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). SCTID 465230007 is the most precise match because it explicitly denotes a device whose function is to fix or secure an assistive tool. Broader parents like generic fixation device or assistive tool device would lose the specific linkage to assisting tools and fixation. Any child or sibling concepts that specify a particular form (e.g., brackets or clamps) are not referenced, so 465230007 remains the correct code."
216457001,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, trailer court (environment)",Mobile home park listed as place of occurrence,"The phrase uses 'mobile home park,' a clinically safe and equivalent synonym for 'trailer court,' indicating the place of occurrence without added attributes. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This maps to 'Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, trailer court (environment)' because mobile home park and trailer court denote the same residential trailer community setting. It does not imply campground/RV park, so a sibling concept is not more accurate."
114832000,Salmonella Splott (organism),Follow-up note: Salmonella Splott referenced,"Within follow-up documentation, the organism referenced is Salmonella Splott. The main concept is the organism identity, which fits SNOMED CT Organism code 114832000. Mapping to a parent would ignore the specific serovar, and to any sibling serovar would be incorrect. The follow-up context adds no clinical attributes; it preserves the organism concept."
71241004,Genus Phthirus (organism),Dermatoscopy: Phthirus genus observed,"This indicates observation via dermatoscopy of the genus Phthirus, emphasizing the organism classification rather than a clinical diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The method is contextual; the core concept remains the genus-level organism. The entry does not specify species or a condition like infestation, so 71241004 is the most accurate code over any parent or child concept."
77022000,Salmonella Oskarshamn (organism),Microbiology organism list entry: Salmonella Oskarshamn,"This wording places Salmonella Oskarshamn within an organism list context, but does not assert any clinical state; it is purely taxonomic. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 77022000, category Organism. Using a broader parent (e.g., Salmonella species unspecified) would lose specificity, and selecting a sibling serovar would be incorrect. The phrase avoids attributes like detection, positivity, or infection, so finding or disorder codes are not appropriate. As a list entry, it remains a synonymical expression of the organism name and codes uniquely to Salmonella Oskarshamn (organism)."
96308008,Product containing angiotensin II receptor antagonist (product),Angiotensin II receptor antagonist Rx,"This entry denotes a prescription (Rx) for a medication in the angiotensin II receptor antagonist class, without naming a specific active ingredient or dosage details. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). The most specific and appropriate match is 96308008 'Product containing angiotensin II receptor antagonist (product),' because the prescription refers to the product class rather than a particular clinical drug. Parent classes are overly generic, and child concepts (e.g., products containing irbesartan or telmisartan) are too narrow. Sibling drug classes such as ACE inhibitors are not suggested by the wording. Using 'antagonist' via 'angiotensin II receptor antagonist' is a standard synonym for ARB medications and maintains correct code selection at the product-class level."
223964000,Orkney (geographic location),Study site: Orkney,"The entry identifies Orkney as a place, with 'Study site' serving as context only. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. Orkney (geographic location) SCTID 223964000 is the most accurate code since the target entity is the named location. Parent concepts are too generic, and no child sublocations are indicated. The contextual label does not introduce a different concept."
183066008,Low protein diet education (procedure),Low-protein diet education provided,"The entry documents that education on a low-protein diet was provided, which is a Procedure. SNOMED CT 183066008 is the most accurate code since the activity is educational and specifically about a low-protein diet. It is narrower than parent concepts like general dietary education and is distinct from low-protein dietary regimen implementation. 'Provided' is a clinically equivalent phrasing that does not alter the concept."
25679005,Cardiolysis (procedure),Cardiac adhesiolysis,"This synonym expresses lysis of adhesions with cardiac location, which is clinically equivalent to cardiolysis. Main concept: lysis of adhesions of the heart. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It precisely matches Cardiolysis (procedure), SCTID 25679005, because the target is the heart. It is more specific than the parent 'Adhesiolysis (procedure)' and avoids child concepts like pericardial-specific procedures since no structure beyond 'heart' is named."
346392001,Cornflour (product),Cornflour noted,"The entry indicates that cornflour was noted, keeping the focus on the product name itself. The main concept is cornflour; the SNOMED CT category is Product. This is a direct match to SCTID 346392001 and does not drift to broader parents or siblings (no mention of starch, meal, or other corn derivatives). The wording adds only context of notation, not attributes that would alter the concept."
710568004,Exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor agent (event),Follow-up note acknowledges exposure to ACE inhibitor agent,"The follow-up context simply acknowledges exposure to an ACE inhibitor agent, without specifying effects, timing beyond the context, or routes. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It corresponds to SCTID 710568004 because it specifies exposure to the ACE inhibitor class. Parents such as generic drug exposure lack specificity, and siblings like adverse reaction, allergy, or therapeutic administration are not supported by the wording."
297657006,Luhya language (qualifier value),Documentation in Luhya,"The phrase indicates that written materials are in Luhya, which unambiguously uses the qualifier value “Luhya language” (297657006). The main concept is the language; the documentation context is neutral and does not introduce clinical attributes beyond language selection. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. Broader parent terms would be vague, and any dialect-specific children would be inappropriate since no dialect is named. The correct code is Luhya language."
394783004,Group home managed by local authority (environment),Council-run group home noted in chart,"The chart note identifies a group home and specifies it is council-run, i.e., managed by a local authority. Only environment and operator attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. 'Council-run' is clinically equivalent to 'managed by local authority,' supporting SCTID 394783004. A generic group home parent or variants managed by private/voluntary entities would not match the explicit operator stated."
223938006,Highland (geographic location),"Location: Highland, Scotland","The entry records a location as Highland in Scotland; the only concept is the geographic place. Contextual labeling ('Location:') does not introduce new attributes requiring different coding. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (qualifier value). SCTID 223938006 is the exact concept for Highland. A parent like Geographic location is too broad, and sibling locations (e.g., Argyll and Bute) would be inaccurate. The wording preserves the same concept with a contextual tag that does not change the code."
445991008,Assessment using hospital anxiety and depression scale (procedure),HADS assessment conducted,"The phrase denotes that an assessment using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was conducted, capturing the procedural action. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps directly to 445991008 by specifying HADS. Broader assessment concepts or other scale procedures would be less accurate. There is no mention of scores or findings, thus it does not map to observable entities."
224021004,Prince Edward island (geographic location),Site: Prince Edward Island,"The generic label 'Site' simply frames the place value, with the named concept being Prince Edward Island. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and SCTID 224021004 captures this exact entity. The wording does not indicate a body site, clinical procedure site, or administrative region, and there is no suggestion of child locations like cities. No clinical attributes are appended, so the mapping remains a pure geographic location."
255246003,First trimester (qualifier value),Trimester noted: first,"The entry states the trimester qualifier and its ordinal value “first,” corresponding to SNOMED CT 255246003 (Qualifier value). “Noted” adds documentation context but introduces no new clinical attributes. Parent concepts without specifying the ordinal would be less precise, and sibling concepts for other trimesters would not fit. It avoids expressing a clinical finding, so the qualifier value is the correct code."
297859006,Fanakalo language (qualifier value),Fanakalo,"A single-word entry naming 'Fanakalo' denotes the language itself, commonly captured in language lists or fields without adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The most accurate mapping is 'Fanakalo language (qualifier value)' [297859006]. Mapping to the parent 'Language (qualifier value)' would lose specificity, and mapping to siblings (other named languages) would be wrong. There is no implication of ability, preference, or timing."
608801009,Open repair of strangulated inguinal hernia (procedure),Open surgical approach: repair of strangulated inguinal hernia,The wording indicates the open surgical approach and a repair for a strangulated inguinal hernia. Category: Procedure. SCTID 608801009 is the most accurate because it encodes open repair with the strangulated inguinal hernia status. Parents without approach or strangulation and siblings like laparoscopic repair or repair of incarcerated hernia are not appropriate here.
226250002,Branched chain amino acid requirement (observable entity),Nutrition requirement for branched-chain amino acids,"This entry states the nutrition-related requirement for the BCAA group. It fits the Observable entity category and corresponds to SCTID 226250002. The wording is a synonym of the preferred term and does not add any attributes. It is not merely 'amino acid requirement' (too broad) nor a single amino acid requirement (too narrow), and it avoids intake or sufficiency measures, thus 226250002 is the best match."
258711006,Non-International System of Units unit of temperature (qualifier value),Non-International System of Units temperature unit required,"The wording requires that the temperature unit be non-SI, defining the unit class without specifying the particular unit. The concept belongs to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category. The most accurate code is “Non-International System of Units unit of temperature,” because the unit is explicitly non-SI. The parent “Unit of temperature” is too broad, and the sibling “International System of Units unit of temperature” would contradict the requirement. No specific child unit is named."
255271000,Phase 4 (qualifier value),Documented as Phase 4,"This phrasing indicates that the documented value is 'Phase 4' and does not add a study entity or clinical status beyond the ordinal phase qualifier. It maps to SNOMED CT 'Phase 4 (qualifier value)' [255271000] under Qualifier value. A broader parent qualifier would be less exact, and other phases would be incorrect. No procedure or disorder is implied; hence trial or disease-stage concepts are not suitable."
39913001,Residential school infirmary (environment),At the boarding school sick bay,"This specifies presence at the sick bay of a boarding (residential) school, with 'sick bay' being an accepted synonym for infirmary. The concept conveyed is solely the environmental location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. The residential school context plus infirmary setting matches Residential school infirmary (environment), SCTID 39913001, rather than a generic school sick bay."
22227008,Ectopic pulse (finding),Palpated ectopic pulse,"The phrase denotes that the ectopic pulse was detected by palpation, which is the usual method of identifying a pulse finding; this does not introduce a different concept or add attributes beyond the finding itself. It belongs to the Clinical finding category, and SCTID 22227008 'Ectopic pulse (finding)' is the exact match. More general pulse abnormalities are less specific, and specifying PVC/PAC would be a child concept not indicated. The addition of the detection method does not change code selection."
443241002,Specimen from pineal gland (specimen),OR documentation: specimen collected from pineal gland,"Intraoperative context is provided, but the statement only asserts that a specimen was collected from the pineal gland, without specifying the technique or specimen subtype. This is a Specimen category concept appropriate for SNOMED CT 443241002. Parent-level 'Specimen' would be too general, and children naming biopsy or tissue would add absent procedural/type attributes. The OR context is metadata and does not affect code selection."
307881004,DSS RMO RM2 report (record artifact),DSS RMO RM2 report item,"The entry presents the DSS RMO RM2 report as an item within documentation while preserving the exact artifact name. The main concept is the specific report artifact; no clinical attributes are added. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 307881004 is the most precise match because it encodes this specific report. Generic report/document parents or incorrectly numbered siblings would be less suitable. The word “item” is contextual and does not change the artifact identity, so the code remains the same."
371526002,Operative report (record artifact),Report of surgery,"This phrasing references the operative report—the written report of a surgery—which is a Record artifact. It best maps to Operative report (record artifact) SCTID 371526002 and not to broader or different report types. The term does not imply pathology, radiology, anesthesia, or postoperative documentation; it stays within the scope of the operation report and introduces no new attributes, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate."
722014005,Cardiology hospital progress note (record artifact),Cardiology service progress note (hospital),"The entry explicitly identifies cardiology as the responsible specialty (“service”) and clarifies the hospital setting. The document type is a progress note. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The best code is 722014005 for cardiology hospital progress note. A parent like generic hospital progress note misses specialty, while a sibling like cardiology outpatient progress note is excluded by the hospital qualifier. The term “service” is a harmless synonym indicating specialty involvement and does not change the code selection."
122662006,Specimen from pancreatic body obtained by partial resection (specimen),"Specimen from the body of pancreas, partial resection","This statement identifies a specimen with origin in the body of the pancreas and indicates the collection method as partial resection. The main attributes are site (body of pancreas) and method (partial resection), consistent with Specimen (specimen). SCTID 122662006 precisely matches these criteria. Parents that omit either site specificity or method are less appropriate, and siblings like tail/head site specimens or biopsy/FNA methods do not align. The phrasing is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not add extraneous details."
223764005,Leyte (geographic location),Location: Leyte,"This documentation-style entry specifies a location value of ‘Leyte’ and fits SNOMED CT’s Geographic location (Location) category. The label ‘Location’ is contextual metadata and does not alter the coded concept, which remains the named geographic place. It matches SCTID 223764005 rather than parent or child locations, since only Leyte is referenced."
245200006,Entire plantaris muscle tendon (body structure),Plantaris muscle tendon,"The phrase indicates the tendon component of the plantaris muscle and avoids additional clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Body structure and aligns precisely with 'Entire plantaris muscle tendon' SCTID 245200006. Parent concepts like generic tendon structures lack specificity, and siblings such as 'plantaris muscle' or 'Achilles tendon' are not indicated. The wording is a straightforward paraphrase of the preferred term and does not change the intended structure or code."
309959002,Child and adolescent psychiatry department (environment),Child and adolescent psychiatric department,"Using 'psychiatric' as an adjective is clinically equivalent to 'psychiatry' when describing a department; the core concept remains a department for child and adolescent psychiatry. This is an Environment concept and maps to 309959002. It is not better coded as a general psychiatric department (too general) or as separate child/adolescent departments (too narrow), and it does not introduce unit/ward/clinic semantics. No additional attributes are implied."
118016008,"Epstein Barr virus early antibody, diffuse pattern determination (procedure)",Anti-EBV EA-D antibody evaluation,"This phrase describes an evaluation (testing/determination) of antibodies directed against EBV early antigen diffuse (EA-D). The concept is procedural, categorizing it in SNOMED CT as a Procedure. The explicit EA-D specification ensures it matches the precise procedure for diffuse pattern determination rather than a more general EBV antibody test. It does not introduce sibling attributes such as EA-R, VCA, or EBNA, nor does it add method or result detail. “Evaluation” here is a clinically equivalent synonym to “test” or “determination,” so the most appropriate code remains Epstein Barr virus early antibody, diffuse pattern determination."
1101401000112108,Carbapenemase-producing Morganella (organism),Pathogen: carbapenemase-producing Morganella,"Labeling the organism as a pathogen does not add clinical attributes like site or diagnosis; it simply indicates the organism role. The core concept is Morganella producing carbapenemase, mapping to the SNOMED CT Organism concept for Carbapenemase-producing Morganella. No species, enzyme subtype, or resistance beyond the carbapenemase phenotype is present, keeping it distinct from the parent genus and broader carbapenemase-producing groups."
411861000,Green coffee bean specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy skin test reagent: green coffee bean diagnostic extract,"This entry conveys a reagent used in allergy skin testing and specifies that it is a diagnostic extract from green coffee bean. The main concept is a product used for diagnostic allergy testing; attributes include allergen source (green coffee bean) and diagnostic use. SNOMED CT category: Product. It aligns with SCTID 411861000, since skin test reagent language implies a diagnostic allergen extract. Parent concepts like generic skin test reagents or unspecified allergen extracts are too broad, and siblings such as roasted coffee bean reagents or therapeutic formulations are inconsistent with ‘diagnostic extract.’ The synonym ‘skin test reagent’ is standard clinical language for diagnostic allergen extract and does not alter the coding."
52925006,Difficult (qualifier value),Classified: difficult,"This phrasing indicates that 'difficult' is the applied classification, maintaining the concept as a general qualitative descriptor without domain, severity, or cause. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value and the correct code is 52925006. It does not better fit any clinical finding or procedure-specific concept. Sibling qualifiers would change meaning; thus, the exact match is 'Difficult' as a qualifier value."
284436000,Pedestrian overpass (environment),Elevated pedestrian bridge across roadway,"This entry conveys an elevated bridge for pedestrians that crosses a roadway, which is synonymous with a pedestrian overpass. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 284436000 is the best fit; terms like generic pedestrian bridge (broader) could refer to non-road crossings, and vehicle overpass (sibling) does not pertain to pedestrians. The synonym “elevated pedestrian bridge across roadway” preserves the same environmental meaning without introducing additional attributes."
224498006,Living with caregiver (finding),Cohabiting with caregiver.,"The entry denotes cohabitation with a caregiver, focusing on living together. It falls under Clinical finding and aligns with Living with caregiver (224498006). 'Cohabiting' is a clinically equivalent synonym for living together and does not imply marital status, family relationship, or professional credentials. Parent or sibling concepts related to other household compositions are less appropriate given the explicit presence of a caregiver."
90802006,Product containing reversible anticholinesterase (product),Reversible anticholinesterase medicine,"The term 'medicine' signifies a pharmaceutical product, and the class 'reversible anticholinesterase' is precisely identified. This aligns with SNOMED CT Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product), SCTID 90802006. Broader parent concepts lacking reversibility would be less accurate; child concepts listing specific active ingredients are not implied. No extra attributes (e.g., dose or use-case) are present."
770391003,Product containing non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (product),Administered: non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"The entry notes administration of a product classified as a non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It does not specify dose, route, or indication. SNOMED CT category: Product. The phrasing directly corresponds to SCTID 770391003. A parent concept for TKIs in general would be less specific, and child concepts naming particular inhibitors or formulations would exceed the detail conveyed here."
223860005,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (geographic location),United Kingdom (GB and NI),"The entry specifies “United Kingdom” and clarifies its components (“GB and NI”), which precisely matches the geographic location concept 223860005. It is a location-only reference without added attributes. Parent concepts would be too broad, and child concepts focusing on a constituent country (e.g., “England”) would be too narrow relative to the wording."
768548007,Senna pod (substance),Senna pod named on product label,"The label context shows 'senna pod' as the named material, without asserting formulation details or other ingredients. The primary concept is the botanical substance 'senna pod', aligning with the SNOMED CT Substance category and mapped to 768548007. Codes for finished products, extracts, leaves, or purified constituents would add attributes not present and are therefore less appropriate."
736336006,Miscarriage inpatient care plan (record artifact),Hospital inpatient miscarriage care plan,"“Hospital inpatient” clarifies the inpatient context, and “miscarriage care plan” indicates a documented plan-of-care focused on miscarriage. The main concept is a record artifact for inpatient miscarriage planning; attributes: inpatient setting and miscarriage focus. Category: Record artifact. The exact match is SCTID 736336006. Parent artifacts like general care plans or inpatient plans without the miscarriage qualifier are less specific, and outpatient miscarriage plan siblings would misrepresent the setting. The entry does not introduce procedure or subtype details, avoiding mismaps to other concepts."
71499001,Dioscin (substance),Steroidal saponin: dioscin,"The entry specifies the precise steroidal saponin by name—dioscin—rather than a class. The main concept is dioscin as a Substance. The exact match is Dioscin (substance) [71499001]. While 'steroidal saponin' indicates a chemical class, the inclusion of the specific name prevents mapping to the parent class concepts like Steroidal saponin (substance). Sibling or related compounds (e.g., other saponins) are excluded by the explicit naming. No dosing or clinical action is implied, preserving the substance code."
217183009,Explosion caused by conflagration in farmhouse (event),Explosion consequent to farmhouse blaze,"The entry encodes an explosion and a causal large fire (“blaze”) occurring in a farmhouse. Category: Event. “Blaze” is commonly used as a synonym for conflagration, preserving the intent of a significant fire. This fits SCTID 217183009. Parent concepts without farmhouse or without fire causation are less specific; specifying different building types or naming a particular explosion mechanism would miscode as a sibling/child."
129286001,Microsurgery - action (qualifier value),Microsurgery listed under Method in op note,"This entry indicates that microsurgery is listed as the method in an operative note, which matches the action/method attribute represented by Microsurgery - action (qualifier value) 129286001. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The context does not add attributes like site or operation type, so other action qualifiers or procedure codes are less appropriate. The phrasing is a context-specific but clinically equivalent representation of the same action concept."
85483007,Upper class economic status (social concept),Patient identifies as upper class economically,"The statement captures a patient-reported socioeconomic classification as upper class. The main concept is upper class economic status; the phrasing indicates source but does not alter the status itself. It is a Social concept, so SCTID 85483007 is apt. Parent concepts are too general, and no sibling tier (middle or lower) is implied, maintaining precise alignment with the given concept."
464926005,"Universal operating table, hydraulic (physical object)",Setup: universal hydraulic operating table,"This setup note references the device as a universal hydraulic operating table, without adding other attributes. Main concept: universal operating table (hydraulic). Category: Physical object. It maps most precisely to SCTID 464926005 because both defining attributes—universal and hydraulic—are included. A generic operating table or an electric variant would be less appropriate. The 'Setup:' context does not alter the device’s identity or introduce different attributes."
732294008,Salivary calculus (substance),Sialolith (salivary calculus) substance,"This phrasing explicitly links the synonym 'sialolith' to salivary calculus and clarifies it as a substance. No added clinical attributes are present. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It maps to SCTID 732294008 because it represents the material of a salivary stone. Parent generic calculus substance would be less precise, and sibling substances for other systems are excluded. Disorder or morphologic abnormality concepts are not appropriate since the entry names the substance rather than a clinical state or structural abnormality."
64035000,Ambloplites constellatus (organism),Organism: Ambloplites constellatus,"This phrasing denotes the organism by its scientific name, emphasizing the taxonomic entity without additional clinical detail. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The specificity to Ambloplites constellatus fits SCTID 64035000 and is more precise than broader categories (e.g., 'fish', 'Ambloplites'). The header 'Organism:' adds context but does not introduce any attributes beyond identifying the species."
411920001,Morus alba specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Specific diagnostic allergen Morus alba extract,"The wording indicates a specific diagnostic allergen extract with Morus alba as the source, directly aligning with the SNOMED product concept. The main concept is a species-specific diagnostic allergen product; it does not introduce therapeutic use, part specificity, or other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps precisely to SCTID 411920001 and is not better represented by parent generic or child pollen-only concepts."
1141721007,No hospital acquired complication (situation),Hospital-acquired complication not present.,"The entry makes a clear negative assertion regarding complications acquired in hospital care. It represents a Situation with explicit context (absence). No hospital acquired complication (situation) [1141721007] precisely encodes this. Using a sibling such as No nosocomial infection would be too specific, and broader No complication of care would not limit the context to hospital care. The synonym 'not present' is a straightforward negation and does not introduce new qualifiers."
31105004,Gargling (observable entity),Observable: gargling,"This entry explicitly labels gargling as the observable of interest, aligning directly with the concept type. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. Gargling (observable entity) [31105004] is exactly appropriate, as no treatment, instruction, or substance attributes are introduced. Broader observable parents would be nonspecific; sibling activities like mouth rinsing differ in method. The phrasing maintains semantic equivalence."
223385007,Jersey (geographic location),Jersey (CI) — geographic place,"The entry names 'Jersey' with a clarifier '(CI)' for Channel Islands and notes it as a geographic place, ensuring disambiguation. This directly corresponds to SNOMED CT Jersey (geographic location), SCTID 223385007, within the Geographic location hierarchy. The synonym and clarification do not introduce new attributes or broaden the scope to a parent region. Siblings like Guernsey or non-equivalent places (e.g., New Jersey) are excluded by the wording, confirming the exact mapping."
266904009,Family history: Genitourinary disease (situation),Urogenital disease noted in family history,"The entry records urogenital (synonymous with genitourinary) disease within family history, without specifying organ subtypes or relatives. The main concept is a situational finding about familial disease in the genitourinary/urogenital system. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation with explicit context, best matched to Family history: Genitourinary disease (SCTID 266904009). Parent concepts are too broad, while sibling or child concepts focusing solely on urinary or reproductive components would be too narrow. The synonym 'urogenital' is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
129035000,Independent with dressing (finding),Nursing flowsheet: dressing independent,"This flowsheet entry documents independence in the dressing ADL, which is a Clinical finding. The appropriate code is 'Independent with dressing (finding)' SCTID 129035000 because it directly represents independence with dressing. Parent or sibling concepts indicating other ADLs or levels of assistance do not match. The context 'nursing flowsheet' is documentation style and does not alter the clinical meaning or add attributes."
305516006,Under care of liaison psychiatrist (finding),Liaison psychiatrist overseeing care.,"Overseeing care is a conventional phrase indicating the patient is under that provider’s care, and the provider is specified as a liaison psychiatrist; no timing or causation is added. The main concept is care oversight by a liaison psychiatrist. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. Code 305516006 is precise to this care relationship; parent concepts for generic psychiatrist care and sibling concepts for liaison teams/services do not match this wording."
1373409006,American Joint Committee on Cancer aT3c (qualifier value),Recorded AJCC aT3c,"This phrase reflects a recorded AJCC autopsy T category value of aT3c, which is a qualifier value. The explicit ‘aT3c’ asserts the autopsy prefix and T3c subcategory, making it the most precise match. Parent terms without ‘c’ or sibling terms like cT3c/pT3c would not fit the recorded autopsy context conveyed here."
216330002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, farm building (environment)",Discharge summary: place of occurrence identified as farm building,"The discharge documentation specifies the place of occurrence for an accident/poisoning and identifies it as a farm building. No extra clinical attributes are introduced. This exactly matches the SNOMED CT Environment concept 'Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, farm building (environment)', SCTID 216330002. Alternatives such as general farm, field, or home are not indicated, and no specific farm building subtype is named, avoiding misclassification."
302708009,Salmonella Kuntair (organism),Salmonella serotype Kuntair,"The term ‘serotype’ is used interchangeably with ‘serovar’ for Salmonella classification and here denotes the same organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This maps exactly to Salmonella Kuntair (302708009). Broader taxa such as the genus or species level would be less precise, and alternate serotypes represent siblings. The wording does not imply infection or other clinical attributes; it only names the organism."
130104006,Biochanin-A reductase (substance),Biochanin-A reductase protein,"Describing the enzyme as a protein remains clinically equivalent because enzymes are proteins; this does not change the substance identity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The entry is more precise than parent categories (e.g., Protein or Enzyme generics) because it names the specific enzyme. No added attributes like source organism or modification are included, so it maps uniquely to Biochanin-A reductase."
440472000,Specimen from transplanted lung obtained by excision (specimen),Reporting: specimen is from transplanted lung and was obtained by excision,"A reporting statement makes explicit that the specimen comes from a transplanted lung and the collection method is excision. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This is a direct match to SCTID 440472000. Parent or method-only concepts would fail to capture the full specificity, and siblings with alternative methods would mismatch. The wording is a faithful paraphrase without adding severity, timing, or anatomical subsite details."
285665007,Increase in pressure (physical force),Boost in pressure,"‘Boost’ is a common synonym indicating an increase, here applied to pressure. No other attributes (e.g., site, cause, magnitude) are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 285665007 is the correct code, focused on the increase phenomenon, and does not map to general pressure or to clinical findings implying specific physiologic contexts."
224003002,Manua island (geographic location),Manua Island cited,"The word “cited” reflects mention in a record but does not modify the geographic concept. The main concept remains the specific place “Manua Island,” with no added qualifiers. The appropriate SNOMED CT mapping is Manua island (geographic location), SCTID: 224003002, under Geographic location. More general parents or alternative islands are not suitable, as the exact named island is given; the verb is contextual only."
719573001,Vacuum assisted excision of lesion of breast using stereotactic plain X-ray guidance (procedure),Vacuum-assisted excision of a breast lesion with stereotactic mammography guidance.,"The described procedure is a vacuum-assisted excision of a breast lesion using stereotactic mammographic guidance. This is a Procedure and aligns with SCTID 719573001, as mammography is a plain X-ray modality; stereotactic mammography guidance is clinically equivalent to stereotactic plain X-ray guidance. Alternatives such as ultrasound-guided vacuum excision or non-guided excision would be siblings/parents and less precise. The term “excision” ensures this is not a biopsy sampling concept, maintaining the exact match."
219292005,Legal execution by beheading (event),Formal execution by beheading under law,"“Formal” and “under law” denote legal/judicial sanction, and “by beheading” specifies the method. This is an Event and matches 219292005 exactly. It is narrower than legal execution without a method and distinct from beheading not authorized by law. The phrasing adds no new clinical attributes."
1137703001,Scalpel blade (physical object),Scalpel blade component,"The wording emphasizes that the blade is a component of a scalpel, matching the concept of a scalpel blade. The category is Physical object. This aligns with SCTID 1137703001 since it targets the blade part, not the handle or full device. A sibling like Scalpel handle would be incorrect, and a parent like Surgical instrument blade is broader than needed. The term 'component' does not add extra attributes; it clarifies part identity."
87032001,Dipeptidyl peptidase II (substance),Report component—dipeptidyl peptidase II,"As a report component label, this still denotes the substance dipeptidyl peptidase II and does not add attributes like values or interpretation. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The best match remains SCTID 87032001, not a procedure or finding, and not the generic parent class or sibling isoforms. The wording is a neutral context for the same substance concept."
4865009,Product containing prolactin releasing factor (product),Prolactin releasing factor–containing medicinal product,"The construction '–containing medicinal product' unequivocally indicates a product with prolactin releasing factor as the ingredient, directly mapping to SCTID 4865009. Category: Product. Absent any formulation specifics, a clinical drug child is not implied; parent product concepts not specifying ingredient would be less precise. The hyphenated phrasing is a stylistic variant and remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
440706004,Full renal function recovered (situation),Kidney function fully recovered,"The phrase denotes that kidney (renal) function recovery is total, reflecting a situation of complete resolution of prior dysfunction with no added details. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation, and the exact match is 440706004 (Full renal function recovered). Choosing “normal renal function” (finding) would be inappropriate because the entry highlights recovery status rather than merely normal findings. The use of “kidney” as a synonym for “renal” is clinically equivalent and does not alter the intended concept."
262428000,Lousiana (qualifier value),Recorded state: Louisiana,"“Recorded state: Louisiana” presents Louisiana as the documented state, which corresponds precisely to the SNOMED CT qualifier 262428000. It is a Qualifier value because it functions as a coded geographic attribute without implying any clinical condition or event. Broader parent concepts (any U.S. state) are less specific, siblings are different states, and children are sub-state localities. The phrasing is equivalent and maintains the same code selection."
242337008,Accidental ingestion of red osier berries (event),Nursing documentation: accidental ingestion of red osier berries.,"This nursing note captures an accidental ingestion event involving red osier berries. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242337008 is the most precise code, as it includes both the accidental nature and the agent. General accidental ingestion would be less specific, and disorder-oriented poisoning codes are not indicated since no toxic outcome is stated."
1971000124109,Transition from hospice to acute care (finding),Transition from hospice to acute care,"The entry explicitly states a change in care setting from hospice services to acute care, which matches the SNOMED CT concept 'Transition from hospice to acute care (finding)' SCTID 1971000124109. The main medical concept is the care transition itself; no additional attributes such as cause, timing beyond the inherent transition, severity, or destination specifics are introduced. This is classified as a Clinical finding because it records a patient care status change rather than a procedure or order. Parent concepts like generic 'Transition of care' are less precise, as they do not specify hospice and acute care endpoints. Sibling concepts such as 'Admission to hospital' or 'Transfer to emergency department' would add destination specificity not present here. The wording is a direct synonym that maintains the same meaning and code selection."
286630003,Soft X-radiation (physical force),Physical agent: soft X-radiation,"The phrase identifies the physical agent as soft X-radiation, still strictly naming the radiation type. This is a Physical force in SNOMED CT. The best code is Soft X-radiation (physical force) SCTID 286630003, more specific than the parent X-radiation and distinct from hard X-radiation. The contextual label “Physical agent” does not introduce an exposure event, procedure, or measurement; it merely frames the concept within documentation. Thus, the entry maps uniquely and precisely to 286630003."
310000008,Accident and Emergency service (qualifier value),Documented service: Accident and Emergency,"The entry shows that the documented service is Accident and Emergency, mapping to SNOMED CT 310000008 (Qualifier value). The phrasing does not suggest a physical department, an encounter, or EMS; it remains a service descriptor. Parent or sibling concepts tied to location or specialty would be less appropriate, making the A&E service qualifier the most precise code for this wording."
732220005,Forty eight hour urine specimen (specimen),"Urine sample, 48-hour collection","‘Sample’ is used interchangeably with ‘specimen’ in clinical documentation. The entry specifies urine and a 48-hour collection duration, fitting the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 732220005. It does not introduce method or testing purpose attributes. Parent concepts without timing and sibling concepts with different durations are less appropriate than this exact 48-hour representation."
469516005,Male urinary outflow analysis system (physical object),Equipment available: male urinary outflow analysis system,"Availability context still identifies the same device: a system for analyzing urinary outflow in males. The concept is a Physical object. SNOMED CT 469516005 is the exact match given male specificity and system-level analysis scope. A non–sex-specific outflow system (parent) would be less precise, and devices aimed at different populations or functions (siblings) would not fit. The entry does not add device attributes beyond its identity."
736731003,Pacifier use (observable entity),Comforter (pacifier) use,"Here 'comforter' is clarified as a pacifier, describing the observable behavior of using it without adding timing or severity details. The concept type is Observable entity. SNOMED CT 736731003 Pacifier use (observable entity) is the precise match. General device-use parents are too broad, and object concepts for the pacifier do not capture the behavior. The synonym 'comforter' when specified as a pacifier is clinically equivalent and does not alter coding."
721968000,Cardiac catheterization report (record artifact),Cardiac catheterization report,"The entry explicitly names the record artifact documenting a cardiac catheterization. The main concept is the report itself, not the procedure, and no additional attributes such as intent, laterality, or findings are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This matches SCTID 721968000 most precisely because it denotes the specific report for a cardiac catheterization; broader parent concepts like generic procedure reports are too general, and sibling or child concepts (e.g., left/right heart catheterization report or coronary angiography report) add specificity not present here. The wording aligns exactly with the preferred term."
695411010000102,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Blastomyces dermatitidis (substance),Target material: Blastomyces dermatitidis deoxyribonucleic acid,"While 'target material' provides procedural context, the entry’s substance is explicitly deoxyribonucleic acid of Blastomyces dermatitidis, keeping the focus on a Substance concept. It does not assert presence/absence, positivity, or results, so it avoids Clinical finding mappings. It is more specific than parent DNA concepts and does not introduce sibling concepts like RNA or antigen."
285080002,Athletics field (environment),Setting: athletics field,"This entry identifies the setting as an athletics field, which directly matches the environment concept Athletics field (environment) 285080002. The main concept is the environment; no clinical attributes are added. The SNOMED category is Environment. Parent concepts like sports facility environments are broader, and child or sibling concepts (e.g., athletics track or specific sport fields) do not reflect the exact phrase."
299408006,Pivot shift test negative (finding),Orthopedic exam: pivot shift test negative,"The entry documents an orthopedic examination with a negative pivot shift test, a clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 299408006 is the correct code, as it encodes the negative pivot shift outcome. A broader parent concept would be insufficiently specific, and a sibling like 'pivot shift positive' would contradict the result. The orthopedic exam context does not introduce additional attributes such as laterality or timing."
223600005,India (geographic location),India (geographic location),"This wording explicitly frames India as a geographic location, matching SNOMED CT’s Geographic location (Location) class. The concept exactly aligns with SCTID 223600005 for India. Parent concepts like ‘Geographic location’ are too generic, and child concepts such as specific regions (e.g., Tamil Nadu) would be narrower than stated. The parenthetical clarification does not introduce any attributes beyond identifying the place."
122605005,Specimen from lung obtained by segmentectomy (specimen),Lab accession: lung segmentectomy specimen,"This lab accession label indicates the received item is a specimen from a lung segmentectomy. The concept is a specimen; attributes include site = lung and procurement method = segmentectomy. Category: Specimen. SCTID 122605005 is the precise code because it combines site and method. A parent like “Specimen from lung” lacks the method specificity, and siblings tied to lobectomy or wedge resection are incorrect given the wording. The accession context is metadata and does not add clinical attributes beyond the required concept."
736186005,Ability to self-administer medication (observable entity),Medication self-administration ability,"This phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the capability to self-administer medication, describing the same observable attribute without assigning a result. The concept belongs to the SNOMED CT category Observable entity and matches SCTID 736186005. It avoids broader domains like overall self-care or adherence and does not introduce specificity to a route or medication type, so parent or child concepts would not be more accurate than this exact observable."
306312003,Referral to hand surgeon (procedure),Referral to hand surgeon for consultation.,"This expresses a referral directed to a hand surgeon, with the referral’s typical purpose being consultation; it does not add a clinical indication, laterality, or urgency. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the precise code is 306312003 (Referral to hand surgeon). Coding instead as 'Consultation by hand surgeon' would misrepresent the action (the consult being performed vs the referral being made), and generic specialist referrals are less specific. 'For consultation' is a conventional referral purpose and does not alter the core concept."
23994008,Trema aspera (organism),Recorded organism: Trema aspera,"The text records Trema aspera as the organism, aligning with SNOMED CT Trema aspera (SCTID: 23994008) under the Organism hierarchy. The chief concept is the species; 'recorded' is context only and does not introduce medical attributes. A parent concept like Trema (genus) is overly broad, while sibling species or child taxa are not indicated by the wording. The paraphrase preserves the same taxonomic meaning and thus the same code selection."
223891004,Norfolk (geographic location),Patient reports location as “Norfolk”,"The core concept is the geographic place Norfolk, reported by the patient. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s Location category and is best represented by Norfolk (geographic location) SCTID 223891004. No country, state, or administrative type is specified, so mapping to a parent would be too general and to a child or sibling like Norfolk, Virginia or Norfolk County would be unjustified. The patient-reporting context does not alter the concept; it merely confirms the place name without adding attributes."
467640002,"Brachytherapy radionuclide phantom, anthropomorphic (physical object)",Human-like brachytherapy radionuclide phantom,"Main concept: human-like (anthropomorphic) radionuclide phantom in the brachytherapy setting. Category: Physical object. “Human-like” is a clinically safe paraphrase of anthropomorphic and does not alter the code selection, making SCTID 467640002 precise. Broader parents without radionuclide/brachytherapy, or siblings with different shapes or purposes, would not fit the wording."
285488001,Does not perform lip spreading (finding),Fails to perform lip spreading,"This wording indicates that attempts to have the patient perform lip spreading resulted in non-performance, without asserting inability. It is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 285488001 precisely captures this non-performance of lip spreading. Parent concepts are too general, and child/sibling concepts such as inability or refusal would introduce distinct attributes not present in the phrasing."
1268555009,World Health Organization classification of adenocarcinoma in stomach fifth edition (staging scale),WHO fifth edition classification of adenocarcinoma in the stomach,"This formulation specifies WHO, the fifth edition, and adenocarcinoma in the stomach, aligning with the classification scale concept. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value — Staging scale. It denotes the scale, not a patient finding or outcome. A parent concept without the edition detail would be too broad, and siblings like different editions or non-adenocarcinoma gastric classifications would be incorrect. “Fifth edition” is the explicit edition, and this phrasing is a direct synonym that retains the exact meaning."
223695005,Nicaragua (geographic location),Nicaragua — national territory,"This variant denotes the country as its national territory, maintaining focus on the geographic entity itself without implying residence, travel, or nationality. The SNOMED CT category is Location with the geographic location semantic tag. SCTID 223695005 is the most precise match. Choosing a broader parent such as Country or Geographic location would be less specific, while children (cities or departments) and siblings (neighboring countries) would not match. The descriptor is equivalent and does not change coding."
434526009,Genus Roseiflexus (organism),Organism genus: Roseiflexus,"This entry labels Roseiflexus specifically as an organism genus, focusing on classification rather than clinical findings. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It is best coded to Genus Roseiflexus (organism) because the wording indicates the genus-level taxon without suggesting presence in a specimen or naming a species. Parent concepts are overly general, and sibling or child concepts (e.g., species within Roseiflexus) do not match the genus-level scope. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
1252654005,Murder of partner (event),Case involves murder of partner,"The entry notes the case includes the event of murder of a partner, preserving the specific victim relationship and the act of murder. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 1252654005 is the correct code, as it directly represents partner murder. Using more general or differently qualified concepts (spouse, homicide) would be less precise. No extraneous attributes like timing, mechanism, or location are added."
223809009,Monaghan (geographic location),Home: Monaghan,"This entry assigns the patient’s home to Monaghan, with Monaghan being the sole geographic concept. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. Monaghan (geographic location) [223809009] is the precise match, as the entry does not differentiate administrative levels (county vs. town). A parent like Geographic location is nonspecific, and a child/sibling like County Monaghan or Monaghan town would over-interpret the text. The context of 'home' does not change the location concept being coded."
84599008,"Detonating cord, device (physical object)",Record notes: detonating cord device,"The main concept is the detonating cord device, with the phrase used in a documentation context. No attributes about usage, timing, or association are present. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). SCTID 84599008 fits best because the wording exactly matches the device designation. Parent device concepts would be non-specific, and sibling devices (e.g., fuse, blasting cap) are different objects not indicated here. The documentation framing does not change the semantics; it simply references the same device for coding."
13518004,Computed tomography without intravenous contrast followed by intravenous contrast and more sections (procedure),"Patient report: CT first without dye, then dye injected and more slices taken","The patient-stated entry conveys the sequence: CT performed initially without contrast (‘dye’ is common parlance for IV contrast), followed by contrast injection and additional slices taken. The main concept is a CT procedure with noncontrast then contrast phases, plus extra sections after contrast. This is a Procedure. SCTID 13518004 matches precisely, as it encodes this exact protocol including ‘more sections.’ Sibling concepts such as ‘CT with and without contrast’ do not guarantee additional post-contrast sections. Using ‘dye’ as a synonym for IV contrast is standard in patient language and does not introduce any new attributes, preserving the correct code."
161576001,History of urinary anomaly (situation),Indication for imaging: history of urinary anomaly,"This entry uses an imaging indication context to state a past history of urinary anomaly, without introducing details of the anomaly or current status. The main concept remains a historical urinary anomaly. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, and 161576001 History of urinary anomaly (situation) is the exact match. Imaging indication context does not alter the underlying concept, and thus broader or narrower history codes are not warranted. A disorder code would imply current disease rather than history, which is not stated. No additional attributes like congenital status or severity are introduced."
730382008,Entire primitive stomodeum (body structure),Entire embryonic stomodeum,"“Embryonic stomodeum” is a clinically equivalent synonym for the primitive stomodeum; the qualifier “entire” restricts it to the whole structure. The concept is a Body structure and should be coded to Entire primitive stomodeum (SCTID: 730382008). More generic parents omit the whole-structure nuance, and parts (e.g., floor of stomodeum) would be incorrect. The synonym “embryonic” does not introduce additional timing beyond the inherent stage of the stomodeum and is thus semantically equivalent."
115291009,"Chlamydia trachomatis, serotype Ba (organism)",Pathogen designation: C. trachomatis serotype Ba,"This entry presents the organism’s name as a designation, with species abbreviation and explicit serotype Ba, without stating presence or disease. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The correct code is SCTID 115291009 given the serotype Ba specificity; parent species-only and other serotypes are not as precise. Using “pathogen” describes capability, not an event of infection, so it does not change code selection."
79148002,Non-exudative (qualifier value),Non-exudative,"The entry is the adjectival qualifier “non-exudative,” which in SNOMED CT is modeled as a Qualifier value that classifies something as lacking exudative characteristics without asserting a separate clinical finding. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 79148002 precisely represents this descriptor. Mapping to a sibling like “Exudative (qualifier value)” or to a clinical finding such as “No exudate” would be inappropriate because the wording is a classification term rather than a statement of absence. No additional attributes (e.g., severity, timing, laterality) are introduced."
404604000,Salmonella IIIb 50:k:z (organism),Follow-up reference: Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae 50:k:z,"This entry references the organism during follow-up but contains only the taxon name and antigenic formula, which define the organism. The category is Organism, with SCTID 404604000 as the precise code. It avoids introducing clinical attributes such as infection or results. Parents without the serotype are too broad; siblings with alternate antigenic patterns are incorrect. The contextual wording does not change the concept."
105247001,Midazolam measurement (procedure),Midazolam level laboratory measurement,"This denotes a laboratory measurement of midazolam level, describing the procedure without adding specimen, timing, or result attributes. It corresponds to SNOMED CT Procedure 105247001. Parent concepts for lab measurement of drug levels generally are less specific, and sibling concepts for other substances are incorrect. 'Laboratory measurement' is a contextual synonym indicating the same procedure and does not change code selection."
332955008,Product containing undecenoate (product),Inventory: stock includes a product with undecenoate,"The inventory note still identifies a product and specifies undecenoate as the ingredient, without providing dosage form, route, or brand attributes. In SNOMED CT this belongs to the Product hierarchy and maps to Product containing undecenoate (product) SCTID 332955008. The substance concept would be incorrect since the wording concerns stocked medicinal products rather than raw chemicals. No signals of monocomponent exclusivity or specific combination partners are present, making child or sibling concepts less appropriate."
16848901000119103,History of primary malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of urinary bladder (situation),Oncology history: prior primary malignancy of the lateral wall of the urinary bladder.,"The phrase 'Oncology history' and 'prior' indicate past context, placing this in the Situation category. It specifies a primary malignancy and the exact subsite, the lateral wall of the urinary bladder, matching SNOMED SCTID: 16848901000119103. A more general history of bladder malignancy without the subsite would be a parent and less precise, while any sibling or child concept tied to different wall areas or histologies would not fit. The wording uses acceptable synonyms ('malignancy' for malignant neoplasm) without adding attributes like stage, histology, or laterality beyond 'lateral wall.'"
82292004,Facial-phrenic anastomosis (procedure),Phrenic nerve anastomosed to facial nerve,"This is a clear description of the Procedure connecting the phrenic nerve to the facial nerve by anastomosis. It fits the SNOMED CT Procedure category and specifies the exact nerve pairing, making it an exact match for facial-phrenic anastomosis. It does not include details that would imply a child concept (e.g., end-to-side method) and is more specific than generic nerve anastomosis parent concepts. Sibling procedures using different nerves are excluded by the wording."
463232001,Orthodontic appliance archwire-cooling device (physical object),Archwire-cooling apparatus for braces,"This phrase refers to an apparatus that cools archwires used in braces, which is a Physical object. The inclusion of archwire and braces context ensures specificity beyond general cooling apparatus. It does not introduce procedure details or timing, and it avoids confusing siblings like heating apparatus or non-archwire orthodontic tools. The synonym ""apparatus"" is equivalent to device in this context and does not alter code selection."
328721004,Gluten-free animal shapes pasta (product),Gluten free animal-shaped pasta product,"This entry denotes a product that is pasta, animal-shaped, and gluten free. Category: Product. The addition of the word 'product' clarifies the SNOMED CT hierarchy without altering the substance. It precisely corresponds to 'Gluten-free animal shapes pasta (product)', while parent concepts lack shape detail and siblings either remove the gluten-free attribute or change the shape. No extraneous descriptors (e.g., flavor, ingredient source, brand) are present."
441992007,Allergy to remifentanil (finding),Remifentanil listed in allergies,"This indicates the patient’s allergy list includes remifentanil, reflecting an allergy status without added qualifiers. It is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT. Allergy to remifentanil (finding), SCTID 441992007, is the exact match as it encodes allergy to the specified drug. Broader parent concepts like Drug allergy or Allergy to opioid are less precise, and siblings referring to other drugs do not match the named agent. No reaction event is described, so event/disorder codes are not appropriate."
80666007,Structure of tectospinal tract of midbrain and pons (body structure),Tectospinal tract at the levels of the midbrain and pons,"“At the levels of” indicates anatomical location without implying any condition, focusing on the tract within midbrain and pons. Main concept: tectospinal tract; attribute: location (midbrain and pons). Category: Body structure. This is more specific than the general tract structure and avoids the narrower sibling concepts confined to one region. The wording remains within anatomical description, supporting SCTID 80666007 as the correct code."
91780000,Entire companion artery to median nerve (body structure),Median nerve companion arterial structure,"This entry identifies the specific arterial structure that is the companion to the median nerve, without indicating any variant anatomy or clinical status. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 91780000 (Entire companion artery to median nerve) is the exact match. Parent concepts like 'artery' lack specificity, and sibling structures (such as companion arteries to different nerves or the 'median artery') are incorrect. The phrasing is equivalent and appropriate for coding."
309490007,Specimen from pancreas obtained by excision (specimen),Clinic follow-up: reviewing pancreas excision specimen results,"The follow-up note references results from a specimen obtained from the pancreas via excision. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and SCTID 309490007 precisely represents this source-method combination. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings denoting other techniques like aspiration would not match. The entry does not add attributes such as anatomical subsite or pathological diagnosis."
870650005,Coated one piece femoral stem prosthesis (physical object),Coated monolithic femoral stem prosthesis,"The key concept is a femoral stem prosthesis described as coated and monolithic, which is a synonym for one-piece construction. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This precisely aligns with SCTID 870650005. Broader parent terms omit the specific attributes, and siblings such as modular coated stems or uncoated monolithic stems would not be correct. The wording does not add procedural factors or presence statements, keeping the focus on the physical object and ensuring correct coding."
773764003,Sting by mollusk (event),Mollusc sting,"Using the British spelling 'mollusc', this entry denotes the same event: a sting caused by a mollusk/mollusc, with no added detail on site, severity, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It exactly matches 773764003 (Sting by mollusk), as spelling variation does not change the clinical meaning. A general parent like Animal sting is less precise, and siblings naming other taxa are incorrect. There is no species-level specification or complication mentioned, so children or related disorder codes are not appropriate."
223963006,Mull (geographic location),Place name: Mull,"The phrase indicates the place name Mull, pointing to the geographic entity. This is within the Geographic location category, and SCTID 223963006 is the exact code for Mull. It does not introduce different attributes or imply other locations, so parents or siblings would be less accurate than 223963006."
363845007,Finger-finger test response (observable entity),Coordination test response: finger-finger,"This entry identifies a coordination test response and specifies the finger-finger test subtype, with no added attributes or result statements. It fits the Observable entity category. SCTID 363845007 is specific for the finger-finger test response, making it the most accurate selection. Parent concepts for general coordination test responses are too broad, and procedure or finding concepts would miscode the neutral response reference."
302322006,Egg-free diet (finding),Nursing note: egg-free diet,"This documentation entry identifies the diet as egg-free, which is a Clinical finding about dietary exclusion. The correct code is Egg-free diet (finding), SCTID 302322006. The nursing note context does not convert the concept into a procedure or advice; it simply records the diet status. No other exclusions or causes are added, maintaining specificity."
388438009,Family Moschidae (organism),Classification entry — Moschidae family,"This phrasing presents Moschidae at the family rank as a classification entry, which remains an organism concept. The main concept is the Moschidae family; the dash and 'classification entry' are contextual and do not add clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most precise match is SCTID 388438009; using a higher or lower taxon would be less accurate. The wording keeps the scope strictly at the family level."
701554009,Femoral head sphericity template (physical object),Please bring the femoral head sphericity template to clinic B,"The mentioned item is the femoral head sphericity template, with a request for transport. The wording does not add attributes like laterality, model, or measurement capability. In SNOMED CT, this is a Physical object, matched to SCTID 701554009. Parent-level templates or different hip-related devices would be less precise or incorrect. The entry uniquely identifies the same template concept without altering its meaning."
223884002,Hertfordshire (geographic location),Patient reports being from Hertfordshire,"Patient narrative context is provided, but the location named is Hertfordshire, which is the concept to code. Main concept: Hertfordshire. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 223884002 is correct because it corresponds to the specific place. Any parent region would be overly broad, and siblings are different places. The phrasing does not introduce attributes that change the location concept."
411755009,Phoenix dactylifera diagnostic allergen extract (product),Date palm allergen extract (diagnostic),"The parenthetical “diagnostic” clarifies the intended product class, and “date palm” is the common name for Phoenix dactylifera, preserving the concept specificity. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). There is no added detail such as concentration or dosage form, so child concepts are avoided. Parent concepts without species detail are less precise; siblings for other species or therapeutic extracts do not match."
242184002,Fall into hold on board vessel (event),Fell into the hold while aboard a watercraft,"This patient-centric phrasing states a fall into the hold with the setting aboard a watercraft, a synonym for vessel. Main concept: fall; location: hold; context: aboard a watercraft (vessel). SNOMED CT category: Event. ‘Watercraft’ is equivalent to vessel in this context and does not narrow or broaden the intended concept. No cause or injury attributes are added. Parents without hold specificity and siblings in other locations are less appropriate. SCTID 242184002 is the precise code."
396256001,Surgical exocervical margin involved by malignant neoplasm (finding),Surgical pathology diagnosis: exocervical margin involved by malignant neoplasm,"In a diagnostic context, the surgical pathology confirms malignant neoplasm involvement of the exocervical margin. Category: Clinical finding. This directly corresponds to SCTID 396256001, with explicit site (exocervical) and margin involvement by malignancy. Parent concepts would be underspecified, and sibling concepts defining other cervical margins would misrepresent the location. No additional attributes are introduced."
53474009,Aedes taylori (organism),Record shows Aedes taylori,"This documentation statement names Aedes taylori as the recorded organism without adding modifiers. The concept is Organism, and SCTID 53474009 correctly represents the species. It does not imply a general genus code or any other species; it also avoids details such as developmental stage or disease association, ensuring the exact species-level mapping is appropriate."
255467000,Lid sacrificing (qualifier value),Lid sacrificing (qualifier value),"Adding '(qualifier value)' explicitly denotes the SNOMED CT category, ensuring the entry is interpreted as a qualifier value rather than a procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This is an exact match to SCTID 255467000 and does not add attributes like laterality or severity. Parent general qualifiers or procedural eyelid excisions would misrepresent the intent. The wording remains uniquely codable to the specified qualifier."
1295479002,International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision glaucoma staging system (staging scale),International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision glaucoma staging scale,"This phrase fully spells out ICD-10 and explicitly identifies a glaucoma staging scale, focusing on the scale itself. The main concept is the ICD-10 glaucoma staging scale. Category: Qualifier value (staging scale). SCTID 1295479002 is the precise match because it encodes this exact staging system; choosing a parent like generic glaucoma staging scale would be less specific, and a sibling such as ICD-11 or ICD-10-CM variants would not be correct for this wording. The synonym “staging scale” is clinically equivalent to “staging system” and does not change code selection."
722143004,Infectious disease diagnostic study note (record artifact),Infectious disease diagnostic study note in the medical record,"This phrase identifies the artifact as a note in the medical record concerning an infectious disease diagnostic study. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Location ('in the medical record') does not change the document type. Parent concepts that omit the infectious disease qualifier are less specific, and sibling document types (reports, consult notes) differ from a diagnostic study note, confirming SCTID 722143004."
224884006,Location within hospital premises (environment),Location: within hospital premises,"The entry labels the location as within hospital premises, stating only the environmental setting. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It matches 224884006 precisely, as it specifies being inside the hospital property. Broader parent terms (Hospital environment) and specific child concepts (e.g., particular departments) are not warranted by the wording. The phrasing with 'Location:' is a contextual label and does not introduce additional attributes."
1290046005,Airburst (physical force),Airburst listed under forces,"The entry catalogs 'airburst' specifically as one of the forces, identifying the physical phenomenon without extra attributes. Category: Physical force. It fits Airburst (physical force) [1290046005] precisely, avoiding mapping to generic physical force or to related but different concepts (e.g., 'wind gust', 'shock wave'). The synonymy is direct and does not change code selection."
427630004,Amycolatopsis methanolica (organism),Amycolatopsis methanolica (organism),"The phrase explicitly names Amycolatopsis methanolica and clarifies it as an organism, making the primary concept a species-level organism entry. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This directly aligns with SCTID 427630004, whereas choosing a parent like Amycolatopsis (organism) would be too general and selecting any infection-related finding would be inappropriate because no disease or presence context is stated. The parent/sibling alternatives do not match the precise species designation used here."
409113002,Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Clinical Trial Group (social concept),Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group label,"Referring to the “label” denotes the naming of the specific pediatric AIDS clinical trial group, which is the Social concept SCTID 409113002. It does not imply patient participation, timing, severity, or any clinical attributes; it simply identifies the group. More general parent labels or organizations lack the pediatric AIDS specificity, and siblings for other research groups would not match. The term “label” is contextual and does not alter the underlying concept selection."
420382009,Sulfamethoxypyridazine (substance),Generic name: sulfamethoxypyridazine,"Using 'generic name' indicates reference to the active chemical, not a particular product or formulation. Category: Substance. No additional attributes (dose, route, salt, combination, allergy) are introduced, so Sulfamethoxypyridazine (substance) SCTID 420382009 is the most accurate code. More general or product-level concepts would be less appropriate given the wording."
76933008,Physical contact (physical force),Physical contact reported,"This indicates that the force mechanism reported is physical contact, without elaborating injury type, site, or severity. As a Physical force concept, it aligns with Physical contact (physical force) [76933008]. Using a parent like Physical force would be too general, and children (blunt, penetrating) or siblings (non-contact forces) are not specified by 'reported,' which is merely documentation context."
467176002,Blood access tubing crimping pliers (physical object),Dialysis bloodline crimping pliers,"The term 'dialysis bloodline' is common clinical shorthand for blood access tubing; paired with 'crimping pliers,' it precisely identifies the instrument. The main concept is the specific physical device used to crimp the dialysis bloodline. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This maps to 'Blood access tubing crimping pliers' (467176002) because it specifies both the tool form and the intended tubing. Parent concepts like 'crimping pliers' are too broad, and siblings (e.g., clamps) differ in type. The dialysis context reflects typical use but does not add attributes that would change the code selection."
31011000119107,Prostate cancer screening declined (situation),Patient declined prostate cancer screening,"This statement records that the patient has declined prostate cancer screening, without specifying any particular test or reason. The main concept is declination of screening for prostate cancer. It fits the SNOMED CT Situation category and corresponds to 'Prostate cancer screening declined' (31011000119107). A generic 'screening declined' concept would be overly broad, and test-specific children (e.g., PSA measurement declined) are inappropriate because no modality is mentioned. The verb 'declined' is semantically equivalent to refusal and does not alter code selection."
62444006,Cyclopentamine (substance),Chart lists cyclopentamine,"A chart listing of the name cyclopentamine references the chemical substance present in documentation without specifying formulation or administration, so Cyclopentamine (substance), SCTID 62444006 is the precise Substance match. Product-level concepts, salt forms, or findings/procedures (e.g., administration, testing) are not indicated by the wording."
10945008,Structure of serous coat of spleen (body structure),Serosal coat of spleen,"“Serosal coat” specifically names the serous membrane layer covering the spleen, an anatomical Body structure. The best coding match is 10945008 Structure of serous coat of spleen. Using a parent concept like Structure of spleen is overly broad, and siblings such as Capsule of spleen or Hilum of spleen are different structures. The term “serosal coat” is a clinically safe synonym for serous coat, adding no attributes beyond the intended structure, thus justifying 10945008."
262149006,Single pass (qualifier value),Single pass verified in chart,"The entry indicates a single pass and that it has been verified in the chart, which is documentation context only. The main concept is a one-pass qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The accurate code is 262149006 Single pass (qualifier value). This wording does not introduce extra attributes or procedural details. It excludes sibling and parent concepts that imply different pass counts or unspecified number. As a synonym, it maintains the same clinical meaning without altering code selection."
699430002,Posterior drawer test (procedure),Posterior drawer testing,"The gerund ‘testing’ still denotes the performance of the posterior drawer physical examination and is a Procedure. No body site, laterality, timing, or results are included. Posterior drawer test (procedure) [699430002] is the precise match. A parent concept (Drawer test) would be overly general, while siblings such as Anterior drawer test or posterior drawer tests tied to a specific joint would introduce attributes not stated. This entry does not attempt to capture a finding."
1344634002,No family history of multiple sclerosis (situation),Social and family history: multiple sclerosis—none.,"Within the social/family history section, 'none' for MS clearly indicates absence in family history. This fits the Situation with explicit context category. It matches No family history of multiple sclerosis (situation) and excludes broader or uncertain concepts. The concise wording is a clinically accepted synonym for absence without additional attributes."
789634002,Genus Physisporinus (organism),Physisporinus genus entry,This phrasing indicates a record entry for the genus Physisporinus and does not include additional clinical details. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 789634002 precisely maps to the named genus. Broader organism categories or any particular species would be inappropriate. The word 'entry' is contextual for documentation and does not change the concept.
289909005,"Labor, function (observable entity)",Labor function metric,"Calling it a ""metric"" frames the function of labor as an observable property that could be quantified, without stating any measured value. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and it corresponds to Labor, function (observable entity). It does not refer to clinical findings, disorders, stages, or procedural assessments. Sibling or child concepts like labor effectiveness or progress would introduce specific attributes, which are not present here."
473109007,History of peripheral vascular disease (situation),Previous diagnosis on record: peripheral vascular disease,"The entry indicates that peripheral vascular disease is a previous diagnosis documented on record, clearly expressing historical context. This is a Situation with explicit context and matches History of peripheral vascular disease (situation) [473109007]. A parent history concept would be nonspecific, and coding to the disorder would ignore the historical framing. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent way to state “history of PVD” without introducing additional attributes such as severity, laterality, or type."
427866001,Low vaginal swab taken by subject (situation),Patient took a low vaginal swab herself.,Main concept: patient-performed collection of a swab from the low vagina. Attributes: anatomical site = low vagina; performer = patient; action = swab taken. SNOMED CT category: Situation. This aligns with 427866001 because it conveys a low vaginal swab specifically taken by the subject. It is not better coded as a generic 'vaginal swab taken by subject' (would omit 'low') nor as 'high vaginal swab'. It is also not a procedure code since the performer context is central. The phrase 'herself' confirms subject-collection and does not add other attributes like purpose or timing.
287845001,Pancreas calculus removed (situation),Pancreatic stone has been removed.,"This sentence represents the removal status of a pancreatic stone, with clear site (pancreas) and outcome (removed). It belongs to the SNOMED Situation category. Coding to a disorder would be inappropriate because the stone is no longer present. Coding to a procedure would misrepresent the documentation since the entry does not describe performing the removal, only its result. ‘Stone’ is a standard synonym for ‘calculus,’ keeping the concept aligned with “Pancreas calculus removed (situation)” without extra attributes."
789314008,Photographic image of face with lips in relaxed position (record artifact),"Face photo, lips relaxed","The entry states a photographic record of the face and includes the defining attribute of lips being relaxed. The main concept is a stored image artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It is not a procedure description and does not introduce timing, severity, or other attributes. This is narrower than a general face photo and avoids mismatch with sibling concepts where lips are retracted, separated, or in an expressive position. “Photo” is a plain-language synonym for “photographic image” and does not affect coding."
312245009,Angiography technique (qualifier value),Technique: angiography,"The entry explicitly names the technique as 'angiography' within a radiology-style technique line, making the main concept the use of an angiography technique. This aligns with SNOMED CT category Qualifier value, as it describes how a procedure or imaging study is performed rather than naming a standalone procedure. SCTID 312245009 (Angiography technique) is the most precise match because no additional attributes (e.g., CT, MR, subtraction, vascular territory) are introduced. Parent concepts like 'Technique (qualifier value)' are too generic, and sibling or child concepts such as 'Digital subtraction angiography technique' or 'CT angiography technique' would be over-specific. The wording does not imply the procedure 'Angiography (procedure)', so the qualifier value is correct."
218112006,Accident caused by explosion of gasoline fumes (event),Gasoline vapor explosion—accidental,"The phrase denotes an explosion involving gasoline vapor and clarifies that it was accidental, aligning with the concept’s accidental event nature. No other attributes are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Event. The best match is SCTID 218112006 because it specifies an accident caused by explosion of gasoline fumes, and gasoline vapor is clinically equivalent to fumes. Broader explosion accident categories lack the gasoline-specific cause, while sibling concepts for other gas types would misrepresent the fuel involved. The dash formatting is stylistic and does not alter the semantic content or coding."
1193626004,American Samoa (geographic location),American Samoa — locale,"The entry denotes American Samoa as a locale, which still clearly represents the same geographic location. SNOMED CT category is Location—Geographic location. The most precise mapping is American Samoa (geographic location), SCTID 1193626004. Using a parent would lose specificity, and there is no mention of child subregions. No sibling region is implied. 'Locale' here is a synonymous term that does not introduce a new attribute or change the concept."
284563001,Hamlet (environment),Service area: hamlet,"This administrative entry identifies the service area as a hamlet, specifying the environmental setting. Category: Environment. It maps directly to Hamlet (environment) [284563001], because 'hamlet' is named as the settlement type. Broader parent concepts (Settlement, Locality) lack specificity, and siblings (Village, Town) are not indicated. The term 'service area' provides context without altering the core concept."
411835004,Trichophyton mentagrophytes variant interdigitale diagnostic allergen extract (product),Trichophyton mentagrophytes v. interdigitale diagnostic allergenic extract,"The entry names the allergenic extract product used for diagnosis and specifies the variant interdigitale of T. mentagrophytes. SNOMED CT category: Product. The term “allergenic extract” is a clinically safe synonym for “allergen extract,” and “v.” abbreviates variant without altering meaning. This exactly fits SCTID 411835004 and is more precise than parent concepts that omit the variant or sibling concepts that denote therapeutic extracts or other Trichophyton variants."
1367675007,Self-injector data recorder (physical object),Recorder device for self-injector,"This entry denotes a recorder device specifically intended for a self-injector, which is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It maps exactly to SCTID 1367675007 by emphasizing the device’s association with a self-injector. Selecting a parent like generic recording devices would under-specify, while choosing a concept representing the self-injector itself would be incorrect. The wording adds no clinical or operational attributes."
35359004,Family (social concept),Patient-stated: “Family”,"This patient-reported keyword conveys the concept of family without adding support, presence, or historical details. The SNOMED CT category is Social concept; Family (social concept) [35359004] fits precisely. It does not imply household, specific relatives, caregiver status, or family history, avoiding misclassification to siblings. The quotation marks reflect patient expression but do not change the underlying concept."
251489005,Focal spikes (finding),Focal spiking on EEG,"This expresses the presence of spiking with focal distribution in an EEG, which is equivalent to focal spikes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Clinical finding precisely matching “Focal spikes (finding)” [251489005]. Alternative codes for generalized spikes or sharp waves would be incorrect given the focal spike terminology. The term “spiking” is a clinically accepted paraphrase of spikes and does not alter code selection."
472941007,Intracranial ventricular catheter tip submitted as specimen (specimen),Nursing note: intracranial ventricular catheter tip to lab as specimen,"This documentation-style entry states that the item sent to the lab as a specimen is the tip of an intracranial ventricular catheter. The concept is a Specimen and precisely matches SCTID 472941007. Removing the intracranial ventricular qualifier would broaden the concept inappropriately; adding device subtype (e.g., external drain) would be too specific. The nursing note context does not introduce clinical attributes and is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
229509005,Graduated compression bandaging (procedure),Nursing note: graduated compression bandaging applied,"The documented concept is the nursing-performed procedure of applying bandaging that provides graduated compression, classified as a Procedure. The phrase explicitly states graduated compression bandaging, aligning with the exact SNOMED concept. The context tag ""Nursing note"" does not alter the clinical meaning or introduce attributes like site or indication. Broader parent concepts (generic bandage application) omit the graduated compression feature, and sibling/child concepts (multilayer systems, hosiery) would over-specify beyond this wording."
16212451000119108,Specimen from left lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchial brushings procedure (specimen),Patient statement: they took a bronchial brush sample from the left lower lobe of my lung.,"This patient-reported phrasing describes a specimen obtained via bronchial brushing from the left lower lobe of the lung. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It matches SCTID 16212451000119108, capturing both anatomical specificity and collection technique. Parent terms lacking the lobar/lateral detail or sibling terms referring to different lobes or alternative bronchial techniques would not be as accurate. “Brush sample” is a clinically safe synonym for a bronchial brushing specimen."
233439000,Removal of inferior vena caval filter (procedure),Retrieval of IVC filter,"The main concept is retrieval (i.e., removal) of a filter from the inferior vena cava; “retrieval” is standard clinical terminology for removing an IVC filter. No extra attributes such as method or success are included. This is a Procedure concept. The best SNOMED CT match is 233439000 because it specifically covers removal of an inferior vena caval filter. More general parent concepts do not specify the inferior vena cava, and sibling procedures like placement or repositioning do not match. The synonym “retrieval” is clinically equivalent to “removal” for this device."
59283008,Maternal death (event),Final status: maternal death,"The phrase conveys the final status as maternal death, focusing on the occurrence of the maternal death event and adding no timing or etiologic attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Maternal death (event) [59283008] is the correct code because it captures the event in a maternal context; the general Death (event) is too broad and stage-specific children are not implied. 'Final status' is a documentation context and does not alter the concept."
20511000087100,Aspiration of bilateral axillae using ultrasonographic guidance (procedure),Ultrasound-guided aspiration of both axillae,"This statement describes a procedure consisting of aspiration, performed on both axillae, using ultrasound guidance. The core concepts are aspiration (procedure), the anatomical site axillae with bilateral laterality, and the use of ultrasonographic guidance. In SNOMED CT, this matches the procedure 'Aspiration of bilateral axillae using ultrasonographic guidance' (20511000087100). More general parent concepts that omit bilateral laterality or ultrasound guidance are less precise, and sibling concepts that specify only right or left axilla or target lymph nodes would introduce different or narrower attributes not present here. The phrasing 'Ultrasound-guided' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'using ultrasonographic guidance' and does not change code selection."
242367002,Accidental ingestion of citronella (event),Poison control note: accidental ingestion of citronella,"Despite the poison control context, the entry explicitly documents accidental ingestion of citronella, without asserting toxicity or poisoning outcomes. This is best coded as the SNOMED CT Event Accidental ingestion of citronella (event), SCTID 242367002. A disorder code for poisoning would be inappropriate because the entry does not confirm a toxic effect; similarly, exposure-only concepts change the route. Parents that generalize ingestion without naming citronella would be less specific."
469486002,Lumbar total disc replacement prosthesis (physical object),Stock item—lumbar total disc replacement device,"A stock/inventory context makes it clear the entry refers to the physical device item, described as a lumbar total disc replacement device. The concept is a Physical object (device). SCTID 469486002 is appropriate because it denotes a lumbar total disc replacement prosthesis. More general devices or non-lumbar prostheses would be less precise, and the wording avoids clinical findings or procedures, so it does not map to device-in-situ or surgical codes."
67996005,Arctogadus glacialis (organism),Arctogadus glacialis noted by clinician,"This entry documents the clinician’s note of the species Arctogadus glacialis, corresponding to the Organism category. The context does not introduce exposure, causation, or any clinical attribute—only the organism name is referenced. Coding to a broader parent taxon or to a different species would be less accurate. Therefore, the precise match is the Arctogadus glacialis organism concept."
45018003,Steroid N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (substance),Record keyword: steroid N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase,"The entry’s content is the substance 'steroid N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase'; the 'record keyword' label is contextual only. This is a SNOMED Substance concept. Broader parents like non-steroid-specific N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases would be less precise. There is no implication of isoform, recombinant status, species, or functional measurement, so no child or sibling concept fits better. SCTID 45018003 is exact."
257712001,Swimming pool (environment),Place: swimming pool,"The item identifies the place as a swimming pool, directly mapping to SNOMED CT Swimming pool (environment) SCTID 257712001. 'Place' here functions as contextual metadata and does not imply additional qualifiers such as public/private or indoor/outdoor. Therefore, this specific environment concept is the most precise match compared to broader or narrower alternatives."
91264009,Structure of glomerular capillary endothelium (body structure),Tissue reference: glomerular capillary endothelium,"The phrase refers to the tissue structure that lines glomerular capillaries—the endothelium. It is anatomical in nature, falling under Body structure. A parent concept like “endothelium” is too broad without glomerular localization, and siblings including “mesangial cells” or “capillary lumen” are not equivalent. The content aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 91264009 for glomerular capillary endothelium."
1295387002,Structure of white matter of brain (body structure),White matter of the encephalon,"Using ‘encephalon’ as a synonym for ‘brain,’ this entry denotes the white matter of the brain and contains no mention of pathology, procedure, or sublocation. It is a Body structure. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Structure of white matter of brain (1295387002). Broader parent concepts omit the brain qualifier, and narrower children specify particular portions of brain white matter, which the entry does not. The wording is a clinically safe paraphrase of the preferred term."
729590006,Entire eighth intercostal nerve (body structure),Whole eighth intercostal nerve,"“Whole” is a clinically safe paraphrase of “entire” and conveys the complete eighth intercostal nerve. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and SCTID 729590006 is the precise match because the entry refers to the entire named nerve. Parent concepts that do not assert entirety and child concepts describing branches or portions (e.g., lateral cutaneous branch) would not fit the term’s scope. The synonym does not introduce new attributes or alter the intended anatomy."
1290170006,Past pregnancy history of early neonatal death (situation),Risk factor: past pregnancy with early neonatal death,"The entry identifies a past pregnancy in which an early neonatal death occurred, framed as a risk factor and historical. No cause or count is specified. Category: Situation. SCTID 1290170006 is the appropriate code because it captures the past obstetric history of early neonatal death; a general neonatal death without timing or a late neonatal death concept would be less precise."
736959331000119108,Carrier of Candida auris (finding),Problem list: C. auris carrier,"In problem-list style, the entry identifies the patient as a carrier of Candida auris. The core concept is carriage/colonization, and the abbreviation maintains organism specificity. No site, timing, or severity attributes are present. This is a Clinical finding, best matched to Carrier of Candida auris (finding) [736959331000119108]. Broader or infection-related concepts would be less suitable. The problem-list context does not introduce new attributes and is a synonymous expression of the same finding."
736371006,Dementia care plan (record artifact),Dementia care plan document,"Characterizing it as a document emphasizes the record nature of the dementia care plan, which is a Record artifact. This directly maps to Dementia care plan (SCTID 736371006). Parent concepts would lack the dementia focus, and more specific children (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease care plan) are not warranted by the text. Referring to it as a 'document' does not alter the clinical meaning; it remains the same artifact."
288072005,Muscle shortened (situation),Muscle shortening identified.,"The entry indicates identification of muscle shortening, which is synonymous with a shortened muscle and does not add other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context (Situation). The phrase reflects recognition of the state, fitting “Muscle shortened (situation)” rather than a pathology or measurement. Parents that are nonspecific to muscle, and children naming a particular muscle, are not supported. Sibling concepts like contracture (disorder) or tightness (finding) differ in clinical meaning."
770697005,Insertion of stent into bile duct using fluoroscopic guidance (procedure),Insertion of stent into bile duct using fluoroscopic guidance,"The entry explicitly states a procedure to insert a stent into the bile duct and specifies fluoroscopic guidance, matching the SNOMED CT procedure concept 770697005. Attributes present are the target structure (bile duct), the action (stent insertion), and the imaging modality (fluoroscopy). This is best coded to the precise concept for fluoroscopically guided biliary stent insertion rather than the parent concept that lacks the guidance qualifier. Sibling or child concepts that further specify approach (endoscopic or percutaneous), duct segment (e.g., common bile duct), stent type, or timing are not indicated here. The phrasing mirrors the preferred term and does not introduce any additional attributes."
38341000087106,Hypokinesis of mid anterior segment of left cardiac ventricle (finding),Mid-anterior LV segment is hypokinetic,"The concept conveyed is hypokinesis affecting the mid-anterior segment of the left ventricle, which is a Clinical finding. The adjective 'hypokinetic' is synonymous with hypokinesis and indicates reduced wall motion. This exactly maps to SCTID 38341000087106 because the location (mid-anterior segment) is explicit. Parent concepts lacking segment specificity or sibling concepts referring to different segments (e.g., basal anterior) would be less precise than this exact match."
214299004,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision, on highway, between motor vehicle and boundary fence (event)","Prehospital run sheet: highway motor vehicle traffic accident, collision with boundary fence.","This prehospital documentation describes a highway motor vehicle traffic accident with collision into a boundary fence. Category is Event. It directly matches SCTID 214299004 by naming traffic context, highway setting, and boundary fence collision. Parent concepts without fence detail or siblings involving other obstacles are inferior matches. The terms used are standard and do not add extraneous attributes."
76424003,Structure of premolar tooth (body structure),Anatomical structure: premolar tooth,"This is an explicit anatomical reference to the premolar tooth, making the main concept a body structure. It maps directly to Structure of premolar tooth (76424003). The entry does not introduce laterality, jaw, tooth position (first vs. second), or part-level detail. Parent concepts are too broad and child or sibling concepts would incorrectly add specificity or a different tooth type."
122654003,"Specimen from rectum obtained by transanal disk excision, intact (specimen)",Intact specimen of rectum following transanal disc excision.,"The text identifies a specimen, its origin (rectum), the acquisition method (transanal disc/disk excision), and integrity (intact). This matches SNOMED CT concept 122654003 and belongs in the Specimen hierarchy. Parent concepts omitting the intact qualifier or the specific disk excision method are less appropriate, and siblings indicating fragmentation or alternate procedures do not fit the wording. The slight rephrasing retains identical clinical meaning."
75508005,Dissecting (qualifier value),Documented as dissecting,"This phrasing shows “dissecting” used as a documented descriptor, consistent with a Qualifier value. The entry lacks specifics about a condition or structure and contains no additional attributes. Therefore, SCTID 75508005 is the correct mapping. Concepts like “Dissection (morphologic abnormality)” or “Dissecting aneurysm” would be inappropriate as the text does not name a pathology."
466359002,Bedside cabinet (physical object),Bedside locker,"In hospital terminology, 'bedside locker' is commonly used synonymously with bedside cabinet, denoting the same bedside storage unit. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The best code is Bedside cabinet (physical object) [466359002], as this term aligns with the recognized synonym in clinical environments. Coding to a generic Locker (physical object) would lose the bedside specificity, and coding to Bedside table would be incorrect. The synonym does not introduce additional attributes such as materials, locking mechanism specifics, or capacity."
1285476007,Histologic grade of primary malignant neoplasm of uterus (observable entity),"Histologic grade: primary malignant neoplasm, uterus","This entry lists the attribute 'histologic grade' and clearly applies it to a 'primary malignant neoplasm' of the 'uterus.' As an Observable entity, it links directly to SNOMED CT 1285476007. It does not include grade values or subsite qualifiers, thereby avoiding more specific child/sibling mappings. More generic parent concepts would not capture the uterine site or the primary nature. The punctuation and layout are typical of data-field notation and do not alter the concept."
224899006,Walking aid (physical object),Walking aid,"The main concept is a device used to assist a person in walking, expressed without specifying type, usage status, or any additional attributes. This falls under the SNOMED CT category Physical object. The most precise match is SNOMED CT 224899006 Walking aid (physical object), which represents the generic class of devices intended to support ambulation. Parent concepts such as Assistive device or Mobility aid are too broad and could include non-walking equipment. Child or sibling concepts like cane, crutches, walker, or rollator would be overly specific and are not mentioned. The wording is straightforward and perfectly aligned with the intended physical object concept, avoiding findings or procedures."
422231003,Twice a day before meals (qualifier value),Sig: BID AC,"The signature line uses standard abbreviations: BID (twice daily) and AC (before meals), capturing the exact dosing schedule without extra information. This corresponds to a dosing schedule qualifier in the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category, and the best code is 422231003. Parent concepts like “BID” alone or “AC” alone would be insufficient, and sibling values (e.g., BID PC) would misrepresent the timing. The abbreviations are clinically accepted synonyms and preserve the intended meaning."
406527003,Clinical trial group (social concept),Case report form includes clinical trial group,"This statement notes that the CRF includes the clinical trial group field or data, focusing on the group entity itself. No attributes such as control versus experimental are present. The proper SNOMED CT category is Social concept, and the exact code is Clinical trial group (406527003). A generic group concept would be too broad, while child/sibling concepts like Control group or Clinical trial arm would be too specific. The documentation context doesn’t change the underlying concept."
84912007,"Static light refraction, function (observable entity)",Static optical refraction of light—function,"The wording specifies optical refraction of light in the static state and labels it as a function, keeping it within observables. The main concept is static light refraction function. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. This corresponds to SCTID 84912007, not to a parent like generic refraction function (due to the static qualifier), and not to sibling procedural or dynamic functions. It avoids interpretation or measurement details."
62404004,Burning sensation quality (qualifier value),Patient describes the sensation quality as burning,"This documentation conveys the patient’s description of the quality of a sensation as “burning,” explicitly using it as a qualitative modifier. The category is Qualifier value, and the precise code is “Burning sensation quality (qualifier value).” A parent like “Sensation quality” would be too general, and mapping to a finding (e.g., “Burning sensation”) would add the assertion of a symptom occurrence, which the entry does not intend. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that retains the qualifier role."
704789005,Multi-wavelength oral examination light (physical object),Multi-wavelength mouth examination light,"This entry substitutes “mouth examination” for “oral examination,” which is clinically synonymous in this context, and retains the key attribute “multi-wavelength.” The main concept is a Physical object—an examination light used for the mouth with multiple wavelength output—matching SNOMED CT 704789005. Generic mouth/oral exam lights without spectral specification would be parent-level and less specific; devices for treatment or non-oral use are siblings. No procedural terms or extraneous attributes are present."
411621004,Anacardium occidentale diagnostic allergen extract (product),Anacardium occidentale diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry explicitly names the species Anacardium occidentale and identifies the item as a diagnostic allergen extract, which corresponds precisely to the SNOMED CT product concept with SCTID 411621004. The main concept is a species-specific allergen extract intended for diagnostic testing. Category: Product. This is the most precise match because it specifies both the source (Anacardium occidentale, i.e., cashew) and the diagnostic use as an extract product. Broader parents like generic “diagnostic allergen extract” would be less specific, and siblings such as therapeutic allergen extracts or the substance/allergen alone would not capture the diagnostic product. The exact wording matches the preferred term without introducing additional attributes."
281419009,Right lung ventilation (qualifier value),Ventilation site: right lung,"This entry explicitly frames the right lung as the site of ventilation, which is appropriate for a Qualifier value serving as an attribute. It avoids introducing any cause, timing, or severity. A site without laterality (parent) would be less precise, and left lung site (sibling) would be incorrect. It does not describe a procedure or outcome, supporting SCTID 281419009."
246584007,Flexor plantar response (observable entity),Documented flexor plantar reflex,"The entry records that the plantar reflex is flexor, indicating down-going toe movement upon stimulation. The central concept is the flexor plantar response; no extra attributes are included. It belongs to the Observable entity category and pairs most accurately with Flexor plantar response (246584007). A nonspecific plantar reflex concept would lack the flexor detail, and extensor or Babinski siblings represent a different response direction. Referring to the plantar reflex as 'flexor' is synonymous with flexor plantar response."
360058005,Intraventricular pump (physical object),Product description: intraventricular pump,"This is a product label context where the named object is an intraventricular pump, fitting the Device/Physical object hierarchy. The entry is function-neutral, with no added attributes such as infusion capability, assist function, or anatomical laterality, so SCTID 360058005 is appropriate. Using a parent device category would be too general, and mapping to siblings like 'Infusion pump' or 'Ventricular assist device' would introduce unstated features. 'Product description' is merely contextual."
465000006,Nasal irrigation applicator (physical object),Nasal irrigation applicator in home care kit,"This entry references the device’s presence in a kit, but the concept is the physical applicator intended for nasal irrigation. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). It aligns with Nasal irrigation applicator (SCTID 465000006) because it specifies the applicator and nasal irrigation purpose without naming subtype or brand. Broader parents and distinct child/sibling devices (neti pot, irrigator) are not indicated. The kit context does not alter the coding for the device."
242263000,Accidental exposure to alcohol (event),Unplanned exposure to alcohol,"The core idea is exposure to alcohol that was not planned, which is a valid synonym for accidental/unintentional, without specifying route or consequence. This is best coded as the Event Accidental exposure to alcohol (event), SCTID 242263000. Generic exposure lacks the unintentional aspect, while route- or outcome-specific children would be over-coded. 'Unplanned' is clinically equivalent to accidental in this context and does not change the target concept."
387973004,Pisum sativum specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Panel component: pea-specific IgE,"This lists 'pea-specific IgE' as a component within a testing panel, which still denotes the substance (the analyte) without any results or clinical interpretations. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps to SCTID 387973004 because it refers to the IgE antibody specific to pea (Pisum sativum). Parent concepts are nonspecific, and sibling concepts tied to other allergens would not fit. The panel context does not change the substance identity or imply a test code or finding."
405660002,Directed donor packed red cells (product),Directed donor erythrocyte concentrate,"The phrase uses 'erythrocyte concentrate' as a clinical synonym for packed red cells and specifies the directed donor source, focusing on the product. Main concept: erythrocyte (red cell) concentrate product from a directed donor. SNOMED CT category: Product. 'Erythrocyte' and 'red blood cell' are synonymous, and 'concentrate' corresponds to packed cells. With no added processing or status, 'Directed donor packed red cells (product)' is the precise code, avoiding broader parent concepts or qualified siblings."
374531000221105,Choline fenofibrate (substance),Choline fenofibrate — substance,"The entry explicitly denotes the chemical entity choline fenofibrate and clarifies its ontologic type by appending 'substance,' aligning it with SNOMED CT’s Substance category. No product, dose form, or therapeutic context is implied, making the specific substance concept the most accurate match. Parent concepts like fibrate compounds and siblings such as fenofibrate or fenofibric acid would be overly broad or incorrect given the specificity to the choline fenofibrate salt."
730564006,Entire head of flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (body structure),Complete head of flexor carpi ulnaris muscle,"Using 'complete' conveys the same scope as 'entire' and indicates the whole of the head substructure of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This precisely matches SCTID 730564006 rather than more general structures like the entire muscle or more specific structures like humeral/ulnar heads. It excludes any partial-head notion and adds no attributes of side, pathology, or timing."
398007000,Regulatory notes (record artifact),Regulatory compliance notes,"This synonym highlights the regulatory compliance purpose of the notes, which is clinically equivalent to 'Regulatory notes' without altering the artifact type. Category: Record artifact. The phrase maps to SNOMED CT 398007000 because it remains a note artifact centered on regulatory requirements. Using a parent 'Record artifact' would be less specific, and other types of compliance (e.g., patient adherence) are not implied. The synonym does not introduce new attributes."
122685007,"Specimen from left kidney, superior pole obtained by partial nephrectomy (specimen)","Renal specimen: left side, superior pole, obtained by partial nephrectomy.","The entry specifies a renal (kidney) specimen from the superior pole on the left side obtained by partial nephrectomy. The included attributes—specimen, laterality (left), subsite (superior pole), and method (partial nephrectomy)—match the target concept. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. “Renal” is a standard synonym for “kidney,” ensuring accurate mapping to SCTID 122685007. Broader parent concepts that omit pole or method, or sibling concepts with different laterality or subsite/method, would misrepresent the documented details."
223652006,Latvia (geographic location),Diagnostic report header: Latvia,"The report header includes Latvia as the location, with the only explicit concept being the country name. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223652006 (Latvia) is the correct, most specific match. Using parent terms like regional groupings would be too broad, and child terms like specific Latvian cities would be too narrow; siblings represent different countries. The header context is metadata and does not introduce a competing concept."
129283009,Training - action (qualifier value),Action selected: training,"The phrase indicates that the selected action is 'training,' aligning with the use of action qualifiers in procedures or care documentation. Main concept: training as the selected action; no additional attributes are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The optimal code is 129283009. Using the parent 'Action' is too general, and sibling options like 'Education - action' are not stated. The entry does not specify occurrence or topic, keeping it as an action classification."
7611000175100,Dipyridamole contraindicated (situation),Dipyridamole contraindicated,"The entry explicitly states a contraindication to the use of dipyridamole, which directly matches the SNOMED CT situation concept “Dipyridamole contraindicated.” Category: Situation. This is the most precise code because the content conveys appropriateness of care (not to use dipyridamole) without introducing cause, severity, or timing. Broader parent concepts like “Medication contraindicated” are too general, and sibling concepts such as “Dipyridamole allergy” or “Intolerance to dipyridamole” imply different mechanisms and would be inaccurate. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not alter code selection."
165319005,Mental disability domiciliary visit score (observable entity),Mental disability home visit index score,"Main concept: index score from a home visit evaluation for mental disability. No extra attributes like magnitude or date are present. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. 'Index score' is a synonym for 'score' and maintains equivalence to the concept. Therefore, SCTID 165319005 is the most precise match. A generic index score or a home visit score without mental disability would be broader parent concepts, while procedure or disorder codes would misrepresent the observable nature."
758637006,Anatomic location (property) (qualifier value),Anatomic location property,"The entry conveys the same concept as the preferred term, explicitly framing 'anatomic location' as a property. The category is Qualifier value. It aligns with SCTID 758637006 by identifying the property that defines where something is located anatomically, not the site itself. Using a more generic parent like Property would lose specificity, and mapping to anatomical structures or the Finding site attribute would be inaccurate because no specific body site or finding relationship is stated. The synonym is semantically identical to the preferred term and preserves code selection."
37363005,Partial coccygectomy (procedure),Partial removal of coccygeal bone (coccygectomy),"The wording specifies partial removal of the coccygeal bone, and the parenthetical ‘coccygectomy’ confirms the surgical nature, matching a partial coccygectomy. Category: Procedure. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent and do not introduce new attributes. The exact code is 37363005. Parent or sibling concepts that omit the partial qualifier or imply complete removal are less precise given the phrasing."
399007006,Left ventricular peak diastolic tissue velocity during atrial systole (observable entity),LV diastolic tissue velocity peak during atrial contraction (A'),"The text captures the left ventricular tissue velocity with peak value in diastole coincident with atrial contraction; the parenthetical 'A'' explicitly references the conventional label for atrial systolic tissue Doppler velocity. This observable fits SCTID 399007006. It is not a systolic tissue velocity or early diastolic e', and it avoids additional attributes such as numeric magnitude or annular segment, which would suggest narrower child concepts."
362893008,Pituitary part (body structure),Segment of pituitary gland,"The entry indicates an anatomically defined segment of the pituitary gland without naming a particular one. Category: Body structure. SNOMED CT 362893008 Pituitary part (body structure) best fits because it captures an unspecified pituitary substructure. Parent concepts represent the whole organ, and children are more specific than the entry’s wording."
24071000181106,Brevibacillus fulvus (organism),Microorganism listed: Brevibacillus fulvus,"This statement lists the microorganism by its species name, adding no information about specimen, site, or pathogenicity. The main concept is Brevibacillus fulvus as an Organism. The most precise SNOMED CT code is 24071000181106. The context word ""microorganism"" is a synonymous descriptor for an organism and does not change code selection. Genus-level or disorder-related concepts would be inaccurate."
309941000,Rheumatology department (environment),Department identifier: Rheumatology,"This entry is a label identifying the department, specified as rheumatology, which conveys the environment setting. It fits the Environment or geographical location hierarchy and matches Rheumatology department (environment) [309941000]. The term 'identifier' functions as metadata and does not change the clinical semantics or introduce attributes like encounter type. It avoids references to clinic, ward, unit, or organizational service, ensuring that the precise department environment concept is used rather than a parent or sibling concept."
468749006,Dental ozone system handpiece tip (physical object),Ozone system handpiece tip used in dentistry,"This entry specifies that the ozone system handpiece tip is for dental use, keeping the focus on the exact device component. Main concept: dental ozone system handpiece tip. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The inclusion of 'used in dentistry' preserves the 'dental' qualifier and does not shift to procedural or usage states; it continues to match SCTID 468749006. Broader siblings like 'ozone system handpiece' or 'dental handpiece tip' lack the necessary specificity of both ozone and tip."
224015003,Manitoba (geographic location),Imaging location: Manitoba,"The entry designates Manitoba as the imaging location, pointing to the geographic place. The SNOMED CT category is Location, Geographic location. The phrase does not specify a particular city or institution within Manitoba, and it does not suggest a different parent or sibling concept. Therefore, Manitoba (geographic location) is the appropriate and most specific code."
871757005,Entire blood vessel of esophagus (body structure),Imaging focus: blood vessel of the esophagus,"Main concept: esophageal blood vessel; context: imaging focus. No morphological or functional attributes are specified. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The entry points to SCTID 871757005 as the specific anatomical structure under focus. Parent concepts (esophagus) or broader vascular system terms are less precise, and child concepts (arteries/veins) would add specificity not present in the text. The wording uses a clear location-based anatomical label consistent with the concept."
1254722009,Family history of disability (situation),Screening questionnaire: family history of disability = yes,"This entry reflects a positive response on a screening tool confirming disability in the family history, which is a situation context. The best SNOMED CT code is Family history of disability (situation) [1254722009]. Parent concepts that broadly capture family history are less specific, and patient disability codes misattribute the subject. The “= yes” marker indicates presence without adding type, severity, or relation attributes."
472914002,Entire extralobular part of terminal lactiferous ductule (body structure),Examined structure is the entire extralobular part of the terminal lactiferous ductule,"This statement identifies the examined Body structure without adding new clinical attributes. It specifies the entire extralobular part of the terminal lactiferous ductule, which corresponds precisely to SCTID 472914002. It avoids implying inclusion of intralobular segments or the whole ductule, and does not reference other units like TDLU, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate."
411972006,Antihemorrhagic bandage (product),Anti-haemorrhagic bandage listed on prehospital equipment,"The entry lists an 'anti-haemorrhagic bandage' among prehospital equipment, which is a contextual inventory mention of the product. The concept is a physical product designed to control bleeding, fitting SNOMED CT Product SCTID 411972006. It avoids procedural actions and does not introduce additional attributes. More general bandage categories are insufficiently specific, and related siblings (pressure or dressing devices) are different objects; therefore, the antihemorrhagic bandage concept is the most precise coding choice."
1186938002,Belarus (geographic location),Belarus (country),"Appending “(country)” clarifies the type of location without changing the underlying concept, which remains Belarus (geographic location), SCTID 1186938002. The category is Location—Geographic location. It does not introduce temporal, causal, or other clinical attributes. Parent regions (e.g., Europe) or child subdivisions (e.g., individual cities) are not specified. The qualifier simply reinforces that the entity is a country and is clinically equivalent for coding."
716931000000107,Record headings (record artifact),Use of record headings in this report,"The entry states that the report employs record headings, identifying the header artifacts rather than any specific content. Category: Record artifact. The phrase remains generic and maps directly to 716931000000107, as it references the presence of headings without specifying a particular heading type. Parent or sibling concepts would be less accurate because the focus is on headings as artifacts."
734442008,Specimen from calf of leg (specimen),Specimen—calf of leg,"The notation style succinctly states a specimen sourced from the calf of the leg, mapping directly to the SNOMED CT Specimen concept “Specimen from calf of leg.” The entry includes no added attributes such as laterality, method, or tissue type, keeping it appropriately generic. Parent or sibling site concepts would be less exact since the calf is explicitly identified; child concepts that specify the specimen type would overconstrain what is stated."
83037006,Anterior approach (qualifier value),Procedure note field—Approach: anterior,"The entry is a field label in a procedure note indicating the approach is anterior, with no further modifiers. It is a Qualifier value and aligns precisely with Anterior approach (qualifier value) 83037006. The parent 'Approach (qualifier value)' is too general absent the anterior detail, and sibling qualifiers (posterior, lateral) are not supported. The field context clarifies documentation but does not change the coded concept."
79879001,Breath smells unpleasant (finding),Patient describes unpleasant breath smell,"A patient description of an unpleasant breath smell conveys the same finding of breath malodor without cause, timing, or severity. This is a Clinical finding and should be coded to SNOMED CT 79879001 (Breath smells unpleasant). It does not identify specific odor subtypes, excluding sibling concepts, and is more specific than a broad abnormal odor parent. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent paraphrase."
1382025008,American Joint Committee on Cancer p prefix (qualifier value),AJCC pathologic prefix (p),"The entry specifies the AJCC pathologic prefix and the letter 'p', which is the qualifier value used for pathologic TNM staging. The central concept is AJCC p prefix, a Qualifier value. SCTID 1382025008 is exact, as it captures the prefix itself. Broader or different concepts such as 'AJCC pathologic stage' (a finding) or other prefixes (c, y) are not implied. The term 'pathologic prefix' is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not alter code selection."
18698005,Sylvicapra grimmia (organism),Gray duiker,"Gray duiker (US spelling) is an established common synonym for Sylvicapra grimmia. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The entry points to the exact species, so SCTID 18698005 is the most accurate choice. Using this synonym does not change the concept selection or add attributes; it does not represent broader duiker groupings or other species (siblings), making parent or sibling concepts inappropriate."
122610009,Specimen from lung obtained by biopsy (specimen),Diagnostic specimen—lung biopsy,"This entry indicates a diagnostic specimen comprising a lung biopsy, with clear source and acquisition method. It belongs to the Specimen category and matches 'Specimen from lung obtained by biopsy (specimen)' SCTID 122610009. Broader parents lacking the method and narrower siblings specifying subsite or technique would be inappropriate. The term 'diagnostic specimen' adds context but no additional attributes affecting code selection."
464320008,Vaginal ultrasound imaging system transducer (physical object),Transvaginal ultrasound probe,"The main concept is a device specifically designed for transvaginal ultrasound, expressed as a probe, which is a common synonym for a transducer. This is a Physical object and aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 464320008 (Vaginal ultrasound imaging system transducer). It does not imply the ultrasound procedure itself or add features like Doppler or 3D, so broader parents like generic “ultrasound transducer” or non-vaginal siblings (e.g., transrectal or transabdominal transducers) are less appropriate. The term “probe” is clinically equivalent to “transducer” and does not change code selection."
416590002,Cyclic peptide (substance),Circular peptide,"Circular peptide is a common synonym for cyclic peptide, indicating a peptide with a closed-ring backbone. This is a Substance concept. The wording supports SCTID 416590002 as the precise match. It does not refer to any individual molecule or product containing the substance, nor does it add clinical attributes. Parent concepts (generic peptide) are less precise because they do not imply circularization; sibling concepts like linear peptide would be incorrect."
398990005,Prescribed duration - brachytherapy (observable entity),Treatment summary: brachytherapy prescribed duration,"In a summary, the entry still refers to the observable capturing the prescribed duration for brachytherapy. This is an Observable entity; it records the ordered time parameter from the prescription. The use of ‘prescribed’ avoids confusion with delivered or completed duration. The modality qualifier ensures it is not external beam radiotherapy. Hence, 398990005 is the most appropriate code."
242232004,Parachutist struck by flying aircraft (event),Parachutist impacted by flying aircraft,"A parachutist impacted by a flying aircraft is an external cause Event and corresponds exactly to SCTID 242232004. 'Impacted by' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'struck by.' The entry refrains from adding injury severity, outcome, or aircraft type, ensuring it does not better map to a parent like 'struck by aircraft' or to unspecified parachuting events; instead, it matches the precise concept defined by 242232004."
299606004,Active range of toe abduction (observable entity),Self-initiated toe abduction AROM,"Self-initiated conveys the active nature of the movement, and AROM specifies active range of motion, with abduction of the toes as the direction. This is an Observable entity. SNOMED CT 299606004 is the correct and most specific code. Parent concepts that omit 'active' or 'abduction' would be too general, and passive or different movement siblings would be incorrect. The phrase does not introduce a finding or measurement value."
3682001,Mycteroperca xenarcha (organism),Broomtail grouper (Mycteroperca xenarcha),"This entry presents the common name 'broomtail grouper' alongside the scientific name Mycteroperca xenarcha, specifying the exact species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most precise code is SCTID 3682001, since the binomial confirms the species identity. Using only a generic term like 'grouper' would map to a broader parent, and other grouper species would be sibling concepts, which are not indicated. The common name is a clinically safe synonym that does not add attributes."
1179057001,Measured quantity of intake of fluid (observable entity),Nursing flowsheet: measured fluid intake quantity,"The concept is a measured quantity of fluid intake recorded within a nursing flowsheet, still an Observable entity. This aligns with SNOMED 1179057001 because it conveys the measured intake quantity without adding route, timeframe, or net/output details. The context (nursing flowsheet) does not change the observable; it simply indicates where it is documented. More general or route-specific observables, or fluid balance measures, would be less appropriate."
263983008,Entire dome of urinary bladder (body structure),Localization: whole dome of urinary bladder,"The core concept is the urinary bladder dome, specified as 'whole,' indicating the entire dome. Category: Body structure. This corresponds to 'Entire dome of urinary bladder' (263983008) rather than a partial dome or other bladder regions. The contextual word 'Localization' frames usage but does not add clinical attributes; 'whole' is a clinically equivalent synonym to 'entire,' keeping the mapping precise."
440318006,Vibrio brasiliensis (organism),Organism name: Vibrio brasiliensis,"The entry provides the organism’s name at the species level, Vibrio brasiliensis, without adding attributes like source or pathogenicity. It corresponds to the SNOMED CT Organism category and matches the concept Vibrio brasiliensis (440318006). Using a parent such as the genus Vibrio would be less specific, and sibling species codes would be inaccurate. The contextual label 'Organism name' maintains equivalence to the organism concept."
77059004,Brazilian horned frog (organism),Taxon: Ceratophrys aurita,"The taxon named is Ceratophrys aurita, the scientific designation for Brazilian horned frog, corresponding exactly to SNOMED CT Organism Brazilian horned frog (SCTID 77059004). The term 'Taxon' is contextual and adds no clinical attributes. Parent taxonomic levels (genus, family) are too general, and sibling species within Ceratophrys are different. No additional qualifiers are included, so the species-level organism concept is the correct selection."
736338007,Ophthalmic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Ward note: ophthalmic surgery inpatient care plan present,"This documentation line indicates that an inpatient care plan for ophthalmic surgery exists, pointing to a record artifact. It aligns with Ophthalmic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736338007. Broader inpatient plans lacking surgical/ophthalmic specificity or non-surgical ophthalmic plans are less appropriate, and procedural concepts are incorrect. The ward note context confirms documentation without adding timing, laterality, or other attributes."
119481000119105,History of aortic valve repair (situation),Patient states history of aortic valve repair.,"The patient’s statement confirms their prior aortic valve repair without adding new clinical attributes beyond history. The concept is a Situation. This maps to History of aortic valve repair (119481000119105) because it denotes a past repair of the aortic valve. It should not be coded as an active procedure, and it is more specific than general cardiac valve history codes or sibling concepts involving replacement."
350101008,Product base (product),Product base,"The main concept explicitly stated is the base of a product without any additional qualifiers. This aligns directly with SNOMED CT concept Product base (product), SCTID 350101008, within the Product category. It does not introduce attributes such as dosage form, route, or specific type of base that would push selection toward a child like ointment base or cream base. The parent concept Product would be too general, and sibling concepts such as Excipient (product) are not invoked by the wording. Therefore, 350101008 is the most precise match."
442767003,Phonocardiogram abnormal (finding),Phonocardiographic study: abnormal,"The phrase frames the phonocardiographic evaluation as a 'study' and labels the outcome abnormal, which is equivalent to an abnormal phonocardiogram finding. This is a Clinical finding pertaining to test results. The best SNOMED CT match is 'Phonocardiogram abnormal (finding)' (442767003), since the modality is explicitly phonocardiography. Parent categories are too broad, and sibling concepts for other cardiac tests would be incorrect. The term 'study' is a common synonym for the performed test and does not alter the code."
4271000179106,Nuclear medicine report (record artifact),Nuclear medicine scan report,"The entry indicates a report generated from a nuclear medicine scan, i.e., the document containing interpretation. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It fits Nuclear medicine report (record artifact) [4271000179106], since ‘scan report’ in the nuclear medicine context is a recognized synonym for the report artifact. It does not introduce specific submodalities (e.g., bone scan) that would be children, nor does it default to generic parents."
27631004,Oligonucleotidase (substance),Patient-reported item: oligonucleotidase,"Although framed as patient-reported, the entry itself is the substance name oligonucleotidase and introduces no attributes such as exposure, reaction, dosing, or origin. The primary concept is the substance, fitting SNOMED CT’s Substance hierarchy, with code Oligonucleotidase (substance) | 27631004. Mapping to a disorder or finding would be inappropriate because no clinical state is described. Parent enzyme concepts are too broad, and sibling enzymes would not match the specific identity."
4784000,Operation on sublingual gland (procedure),Surgical procedure on the sublingual gland,"Main concept: a surgical procedure occurring on the sublingual gland, without specification of method, extent, or reason. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This aligns with the general procedure concept SCTID 4784000 “Operation on sublingual gland,” as it conveys a nonspecific surgical operation on that organ. More granular procedures (e.g., removal, repair, drainage) are not stated and would be child concepts. Broader categories like procedures on salivary glands do not capture the sublingual specificity present here."
61915002,Blood group antigen Walin (substance),Walin antigen (blood group),"This is a straightforward synonym that designates Walin as a blood group antigen without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 61915002 is the exact match as it names the specific antigen. Higher-level categories like ‘Blood group antigen’ are too broad, while other antigen names would be siblings. No procedural or result context is implied, avoiding misclassification as a test or finding."
24384004,Naja naja oxiana (organism),Photographic ID: Naja naja oxiana,"This describes an identification based on imagery, naming the organism Naja naja oxiana. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The precise trinomial supports selection of SCTID 24384004 over parent, sibling, or genus-level concepts. The imaging context adds no clinical attributes or conditions, so the entry remains an unambiguous representation of the organism taxon."
16216411000119106,Conjunctival smear specimen (specimen),Conjunctival smear sample on slide,"This denotes a specimen comprising a conjunctival smear mounted on a slide, which is typical for smear specimens and maps to Conjunctival smear specimen (Specimen). Mentioning the slide reflects the specimen’s medium, not a different concept. Broader parents (smear specimen) lack the specific source, and siblings (swab/scraping) indicate different collection methods. No extra attributes are introduced."
223989006,Anglesey (geographic location),Diagnostic report reference: Anglesey,"The phrase indicates a reference in a diagnostic report but only names the geographic location Anglesey. It best maps to Anglesey (geographic location), SCTID 223989006, under the Location hierarchy. The entry avoids introducing attributes such as exposure, timing, or clinical findings; it simply mentions the place. A broader parent (Wales) or sibling/child concept would not match the specific island named. Thus, the precise code for Anglesey is appropriate here."
404497006,"Finding of Moraxella catarrhalis, beta lactamase negative (finding)",Beta-lactamase negative phenotype in Moraxella catarrhalis,"This statement specifies a phenotype of Moraxella catarrhalis that is beta-lactamase negative, a Clinical finding centered on enzymatic status. The exact SNOMED CT concept is Finding of Moraxella catarrhalis, beta lactamase negative because it records the organism and the negative enzyme phenotype. Parent concepts covering general organism findings or enzyme status without specifying the organism are less accurate, while sibling concepts that indicate a positive phenotype do not match. ‘Phenotype’ here is used synonymously with the organism’s enzyme production status and does not introduce additional attributes beyond those encoded in the concept."
85365003,Entire arteriolae rectae vera of kidney (body structure),Target structure identified: renal arteriolae rectae vera,"This wording designates the renal arteriolae rectae vera as the target structure, maintaining focus on the anatomical entity without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The most precise code is SCTID 85365003, which covers the entire true straight arterioles of the kidney. Parent concepts (renal arteriole) are too general, and siblings (venulae rectae or spuriae) are distinct vessels. 'Renal' is a standard synonym for kidney and preserves the intended concept."
445300006,Emergency department record (record artifact),Emergency department record artifact,"The entry explicitly names the artifact as the emergency department record, using the term ""record artifact"" consistent with SNOMED terminology. No other attributes are present. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This directly matches Emergency department record (record artifact), SCTID 445300006. Broader parent artifacts or narrower ED document subtypes are not appropriate given the general, ED-specific record reference."
369222001,Entire temporal operculum (body structure),Whole temporal operculum,"This phrase conveys the complete anatomical structure of the temporal operculum without partiality or laterality. The main concept is a Body structure; in SNOMED CT, SCTID 369222001 (Entire temporal operculum) is the exact match because “whole” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “entire.” It does not imply a segment, subpart, or bilateral involvement and thus is more specific than the generic parent 'Temporal operculum.'"
265781000,Entire eyebrow (body structure),Clinical note site: eyebrow,"The term denotes the eyebrow as the site referenced in a note, with no additional attributes such as laterality or tissue specificity. Category: Body structure. SCTID 265781000 Entire eyebrow matches best because it represents the full eyebrow structure. Parent concepts like eyebrow region would be less exact, and children (e.g., left/right eyebrow, eyebrow skin) would add details not stated. The clinical context label 'site' does not change the anatomical structure being represented."
12831000087100,Mammography of right breast specimen (procedure),"Specimen mammography, right breast","This phrasing denotes mammography of a breast specimen and specifies the side as right, ensuring correct modality and laterality on a specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It aligns with SCTID 12831000087100. Parent concepts without laterality are too general, and sibling concepts that involve the actual right breast (patient) rather than the specimen are inappropriate. Comma-separated formatting does not alter the clinical meaning."
734342007,Specimen from mass of anterior mediastinum (specimen),Lab entry — anterior mediastinal mass specimen,"The entry is a lab context notation identifying a specimen from an anterior mediastinal mass, which correctly maps to the Specimen concept SCTID 734342007. It provides both the source lesion ('mass') and location ('anterior mediastinum') without adding method or type attributes, thus avoiding child concepts. More general parent categories would omit either the mass detail or the mediastinal compartment, and siblings pertaining to other compartments are not suitable."
1179504007,Cystine within reference range (finding),Cystine is within expected reference range,"The entry asserts that cystine is within the expected reference range, meaning a normal result relative to established intervals. The main concept is cystine measurement status; the attribute is 'within reference range'. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 1179504007 fits precisely because it represents cystine within reference range. Parent concepts lack analyte specificity, and siblings or children indicating abnormal levels or specimen specifics are not supported. 'Expected reference range' is a synonymous phrasing and does not introduce new attributes."
702927004,Urgent care clinic (environment),Service venue: urgent care clinic,"This indicates the service venue is an urgent care clinic, describing the environmental context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and code 702927004 is the exact match. Broader venues or different siblings (emergency department, primary care clinic) would misrepresent the setting. The term 'Service venue' adds no clinical attributes and is semantically equivalent to naming the urgent care clinic environment."
70232002,Frequent (qualifier value),Follow-up documentation: frequent,"In a follow-up context, the term 'frequent' is recorded, which conveys the frequency qualifier only. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the most precise code is Frequent (qualifier value) [70232002]. Any sibling like 'rare', 'occasional', or 'regular' would alter the meaning. The entry avoids introducing additional attributes and remains focused solely on frequency."
242507000,Burning due to contact with hot solid objects and materials (event),Contact with hot solid material resulting in burning,"This entry focuses on the mechanism: contact with a hot solid material that resulted in burning, matching the event description. Category: Event. SCTID 242507000 is exact, distinguishing solid material contact from other thermal mechanisms. No attributes like body site or severity are present, so mapping to a burn disorder is not warranted. Parent-level exposure to heat lacks specificity; sibling events (hot liquid/vapor or flame) would be incorrect. The terms used are clinically equivalent and do not change code selection."
467834007,Chest-oscillation airway secretion clearing system hose (physical object),Device part: HFCWO vest hose,"This entry labels the hose as a device part for the HFCWO vest setup. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It specifically denotes the hose and not the entire system or vest, fitting SCTID 467834007 exactly. The context label ‘Device part’ does not change the underlying concept; it simply clarifies component status and remains an equivalent synonym for the hose."
701448005,Surgical-generator software upgrade key (physical object),Software upgrade key for the surgical generator,"This phrase identifies a physical key intended for software upgrading of a surgical generator, aligning with 'Surgical-generator software upgrade key (physical object)' SCTID 701448005. The concept category is Physical object. The wording avoids any extraneous attributes and keeps the device context confined to 'surgical generator.' A parent concept such as 'Software upgrade key' would be overly generic, while sibling terms for other devices or generators would not match. The paraphrase is a clinically equivalent synonym that maintains the same semantics as the preferred term, so the specific code is appropriate."
1078221007,Abnormal number of permanent teeth (finding),"Patient reports: ""I don't have the right number of adult teeth""","This patient-reported statement indicates an abnormal number of adult (permanent) teeth, which corresponds to Abnormal number of permanent teeth (finding) SCTID 1078221007. The main concept is a count abnormality limited to permanent dentition; directionality (more vs fewer) is not specified, and no additional attributes are introduced. It is a Clinical finding. Using 'adult teeth' narrows to permanent dentition, avoiding the broader parent concept. Child concepts such as hypodontia or supernumerary permanent teeth are not supported because the statement does not specify the nature of the abnormality. The synonym is clinically equivalent."
65500002,"Lymphocyte chemotaxis, function (observable entity)",Lymphocyte chemotaxis functional property,"This describes the property of lymphocytes related to chemotaxis as a function, which is an observable. No measurement, abnormality, or context implying procedure is present. The category is Observable entity, and SCTID 65500002 precisely captures this concept. Parent and sibling observables for other cell types or general chemotaxis are less specific than lymphocyte-focused chemotaxis."
309929007,Clinical genetics department (environment),Clinical Genetics Department recorded as site,"The entry indicates that the site recorded is the Clinical Genetics Department, an environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, and the precise code is Clinical genetics department (environment) [309929007]. The wording is metadata and does not imply a procedure or event. Parent concepts such as Hospital department (environment) are too broad, while siblings like Genetic counseling clinic or Genetics laboratory denote different settings than a department. Therefore, the chosen concept fits exactly."
282645007,Ability to bridge (observable entity),Functional status: ability to bridge,The entry points to the specific functional status property concerning bridging. It is an Observable entity and matches Ability to bridge (282645007). The ‘functional status’ header is contextual and does not introduce measurement results or qualifiers. It is more specific than parent general functional status concepts and distinct from sibling abilities.
421908005,Washington (geographic location),Current location: Washington,"The phrase identifies “Washington” as the location, matching Washington (geographic location), SCTID 421908005; the qualifier “Current location” is context and not a different code. The main concept is the place. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). It is not broader than a country nor narrower than a city/county and excludes Washington, D.C. as it does not mention D.C. The entry is a clear representation of the same geographic concept."
79223005,Structure of arch of seventh thoracic vertebra (body structure),Region of interest: T7 neural arch,"This entry frames the anatomy as a region of interest, specifically the neural (vertebral) arch of T7, without implying any pathological findings. It represents a Body structure. SCTID 79223005 is the precise code because it denotes the arch of the seventh thoracic vertebra. Parents like vertebral arch unspecified or the entire T7 vertebra lack appropriate specificity. Child concepts such as lamina or pedicle of T7 are parts of the arch, and siblings representing other thoracic vertebral levels would not correspond to T7."
52065008,"Diaper, device (physical object)",Packaging label: diaper,"Referencing the packaging label for a diaper points to the physical product itself. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). The entry does not specify material, disposability, or user type; hence SCTID 52065008 is the most accurate mapping. Using a parent concept would be non-specific, and child variants are not indicated."
287305003,Removal of foreign body from bronchus by incision (procedure),Bronchial incision to remove foreign body,"The phrase identifies an incision into the bronchus (“bronchial incision”) performed to remove a foreign body. Category: Procedure. This directly corresponds to SCTID 287305003 because it specifies both the anatomical site (bronchus) and the approach (incision). Using ‘bronchial’ is equivalent to ‘bronchus’. Parent concepts lacking method are less precise, and siblings specifying bronchoscopy or tracheal location are inconsistent with the wording. No additional attributes are introduced."
706150008,Operating table system (physical object),Operating table system documented,"This documentation-style statement mentions the operating table system and adds no specific attributes about model or function beyond acknowledging it in the record. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The appropriate code is Operating table system (physical object), SCTID 706150008. Mapping to broader documentation concepts or to 'operating table' alone would be less precise because the entry emphasizes the system."
397438005,Specimen from lymph node obtained by staging laparotomy (specimen),Lymph node specimen obtained during staging laparotomy,"The entry explicitly identifies a specimen from a lymph node and states it was obtained during a staging laparotomy. The main concept is a specimen, with attributes: source tissue (lymph node) and collection context (staging laparotomy). In SNOMED CT, this aligns with a Specimen category, exactly matching SCTID 397438005. Using the term 'obtained during' is a clinically equivalent phrasing to 'obtained by.' More general parent concepts like 'Specimen from lymph node' lack the staging laparotomy qualifier, and sibling concepts involving other acquisition methods (e.g., biopsy alone) or different procedures do not fit the stated wording."
733103005,Tissue specimen from scar (specimen),Tissue specimen from scar,"This phrase explicitly denotes a specimen consisting of tissue that originates from a scar, without adding any details about method, location, timing, or processing. The main concept is a specimen source (scar) and material (tissue). In SNOMED CT, this maps most precisely to Tissue specimen from scar (specimen), SCTID 733103005, within the Specimen hierarchy. A broader parent like Tissue specimen would lose the scar origin, and procedural concepts such as scar biopsy would be incorrect because the entry is about the specimen, not the procedure. The wording is exact and does not introduce attributes that would shift coding to a child or sibling concept."
258510005,Penis swab (specimen),Penile swab provided as specimen,"This entry indicates the provided specimen is a swab sourced from the penis. The main concept is a specimen, with attributes limited to site and specimen type. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It precisely maps to 258510005, Penis swab (specimen), rather than any broader swab specimen or non-penile site swab. No additional qualifiers like test method or clinical indication are present. The wording is a clear paraphrase that preserves the original semantic content."
78736001,Alpha>2< hS glycoprotein (substance),Biomolecule noted: fetuin-A,"This phrasing mentions the biomolecule name without introducing measurement, specimen, or clinical interpretation, referring to the same substance, fetuin-A (alpha-2-HS glycoprotein), SNOMED CT 78736001. The context label 'biomolecule' is generic and does not force a different hierarchy. Parent terms are nonspecific, and sibling proteins would be incorrect. As a clinically equivalent synonym, it stays precisely within the Substance category."
1365800004,Photographic intraoral direct image of right buccal segment with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),"Dental photo: intraoral direct, right buccal segment in centric relation","This describes a dental photographic record captured intraorally without a mirror of the right buccal segment, with teeth in centric relation. Attributes: photographic, intraoral direct, right buccal segment, centric relation. Category: Record artifact. SCTID 1365800004 is exact. Broader artifacts or those for different regions, laterality, or indirect technique would not be appropriate. The phrasing “Dental photo” and “in centric relation” are synonymous with the preferred term’s attributes, maintaining equivalence without introducing new information."
1354742001,Bone structure of left eleventh rib (body structure),Left eleventh costal bone,"“Costal” is a recognized synonym for rib, and “bone” ensures the osseous structure; left laterality and eleventh rib are specified. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This precisely matches SCTID 1354742001 as the bone structure of the left eleventh rib. A concept that includes non-bony components (e.g., overall rib including cartilage) would be less specific, and any right-sided or non-eleventh rib sibling fails the stated attributes. No subpart or condition is implied."
78641001,"Nylon suture, device (physical object)",Packaging contents: nylon suture,"This indicates the packaged device is a nylon suture without additional specifications like size or needle. It corresponds to a Device (physical object). The best SNOMED CT code is 78641001 Nylon suture, device, given the explicit nylon material. A general 'Suture, device' omits the material; children specifying monofilament or attached needle are not stated. Mention of packaging is contextual and does not alter the device identification."
223679005,Slovenia (geographic location),Slovenian Republic,"“Slovenian Republic” is a natural-language synonym for the same country entity and refers to Slovenia as a sovereign state. It matches Slovenia (geographic location), SCTID 223679005, in the Geographic location (Location) hierarchy. The phrasing does not introduce non-geographic attributes and does not imply a broader or narrower area (e.g., Europe or Ljubljana). This synonym remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not change the code."
712689006,Etofylline (substance),Active substance — etofylline,"Describing etofylline as an “active substance” continues to reference the chemical component itself without moving into product-specific detail. Category: Substance. The precise SNOMED concept is Etofylline (substance) [712689006]. This does not introduce dosage, route, brand, or combination, so medicinal product concepts are less appropriate. Parent classes like pharmacologic groupings are too broad compared to the exact substance named."
787602004,Entire posterior mediastinal cavity (body structure),Site label: entire posterior mediastinal cavity,"This entry assigns a site label to the entire posterior mediastinal cavity, identifying a whole anatomical cavity. It falls under the Body structure category and maps to SCTID 787602004. Parent terms such as posterior mediastinum that do not specify the cavity or its entirety are less precise, and child/sibling concepts focusing on subregions or different compartments do not fit. The label context does not introduce new attributes."
216191008,"Hit by object falling from aircraft, without accident to aircraft, member of crew of commercial aircraft in surface to surface transport injured (event)",Incident description: Member of crew of commercial aircraft injured after being hit by object falling from aircraft; without accident to aircraft; in surface-to-surface transport.,"This incident description contains the key elements: a crew member of a commercial aircraft was injured when hit by an object falling from the aircraft, with no accident to the aircraft, in a surface-to-surface transport context. As an Event, this directly matches SCTID 216191008. Parents lacking the crew/no-accident constraints and siblings with aircraft accident involvement or passenger status would be less appropriate. The phrasing is a faithful paraphrase with clinically equivalent terms."
272446007,Per-location (qualifier value),Per location,"The phrase explicitly denotes the qualifier 'per location' without attaching any other attributes; the main concept is the normalization basis being location. This is a SNOMED CT Qualifier value, used to specify that a measure or count is expressed for each location. It aligns directly with SCTID 272446007 because it encodes the per-location basis. Broader parents (e.g., generic 'per' or other per-unit qualifiers) or siblings such as per-time or per-patient would be less precise. No additional severity, timing, laterality, or causation is introduced, making this the exact match."
1201869002,Metabacillus idriensis (organism),Taxonomic result: Metabacillus idriensis,"This statement reports a taxonomy result of Metabacillus idriensis, introducing no attributes about clinical status, location, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The correct code is Metabacillus idriensis (1201869002). Coding to a broader genus or to a clinical finding would not align with the purely organismal identification expressed. The taxonomic context does not alter the organism concept selection."
32218000,Biopsy of esophagus (procedure),Bx of esophagus,"This is a shorthand documentation indicating a biopsy (bx) of the esophagus. The main concept is tissue sampling from the esophagus via biopsy. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It matches SCTID 32218000 (Biopsy of esophagus) precisely and avoids specifying technique, subsite, or combined procedures. Parent concepts are overly broad, and child concepts requiring approach detail are not supported by the wording. The use of “bx” is a common clinical synonym for biopsy and does not introduce any new attributes; therefore, the general esophageal biopsy procedure code is the most accurate selection."
251897005,Chest pain rating (staging scale),Chest pain rating scale (triage),"This documents the presence of a chest pain rating scale in the triage context, still referring to the instrument rather than an action or outcome. The category is Qualifier value—Staging scale. The context ‘triage’ does not change the concept or add attributes about the patient’s pain; it just situates the scale usage. Parent generic scales or sibling pain scales for other sites would be less precise, and findings or scores are not indicated."
242745001,Accident caused by cloth cutting machine (event),Patient reports an accident caused by a cloth cutting machine,"This patient-reported statement conveys an accident with a specified cause: a cloth cutting machine. SNOMED CT category: Event. It maps to 242745001 because the causal machine is explicitly named. The phrasing avoids added attributes such as timing, severity, or location, ensuring it does not better fit a parent or sibling concept."
78286006,Lantadene A (substance),Diagnostic report subject: Lantadene A,"Framing Lantadene A as the subject of a diagnostic report still names only the substance without adding presence, measurement, or clinical effect. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Substance category. The exact code match is Lantadene A (substance), SCTID 78286006. Observable entities or findings would be inappropriate because no values or outcomes are stated. The contextual descriptor “report subject” does not change the identity of the concept from the substance."
223935009,Fife (geographic location),Works in Fife,"The statement indicates employment context but clearly references the geographic place Fife. The main concept is Fife as a location; employment is a contextual attribute that does not alter the coded entity. In SNOMED CT this is a Location concept; Fife (geographic location), SCTID 223935009, best matches. Parents such as Scotland are too broad, and child or sibling locations are not specified. The phrase remains a reference to the same place, supporting the Fife code selection."
164808009,Special female test not done (situation),Record indicates special female test not done,"This entry cites the record but still asserts the same situation: the special female test is not done. The principal concept is the special female test with explicit context of non-performance. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 164808009 precisely encodes this. A parent concept would be too general, and any sibling or child concept that adds causes or specifies a particular female test would be inappropriate."
216452007,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, river (environment)",Location of accidental event: river,"The phrase identifies the river as the location of the accidental event, with no added details about mechanism or severity. This fits the Environment or geographical location category and maps precisely to SNOMED 216452007. Parent concepts lack the location specificity, and siblings such as lake or ocean are not applicable. The term “location of accidental event” is equivalent to “place of occurrence,” preserving the intended concept."
773431002,Obstetric perinatal care plan (record artifact),Obstetric perinatal care plan document,"“Document” highlights that this is a documented plan artifact. The entry targets an obstetric care plan specific to the perinatal period, aligning with the Record artifact hierarchy. SCTID 773431002 is exact for an obstetric perinatal care plan document. Broader parent artifacts (generic care plan documents) or sibling artifacts (birth plan documents) are not as precise for the full perinatal obstetric scope. No added attributes are included."
217302006,Jump from burning farmhouse (event),Witness reports jump from burning farmhouse,"This entry describes the event as reported by a witness: a jump from a burning farmhouse. The informational source (witness) is contextual and does not change the coded event. Attributes are the jump action and the burning farmhouse origin. It belongs to the Event category and maps to “Jump from burning farmhouse (event)” SCTID 217302006. Broader parent concepts would omit farmhouse specificity, and sibling concepts for other structure types would not match. The phrasing remains a clinically equivalent representation without adding injuries, timing, or other qualifiers."
443181000124108,Standard infant formula (product),Normal infant formula,"This denotes normal (i.e., standard, non-specialty) infant formula as a Product. “Normal” is a clinically acceptable synonym for “standard” in feeding documentation and does not change the concept. SCTID 443181000124108 is the most specific match. Parent “Infant formula” lacks the standard qualifier, and any sibling/child formulas are inappropriate because no special attributes are described."
122619005,Specimen from pleura obtained by thoracentesis (specimen),Pleural aspirate specimen (thoracentesis),"“Aspirate” indicates fluid drawn by a needle; paired with “thoracentesis,” it specifies the method and site (pleural), fitting the Specimen category and SCTID 122619005. It avoids mapping to siblings like biopsy-derived pleural specimens or chest tube drainage specimens, and it does not add timing, laterality, or diagnostic attributes beyond source and collection method."
14692001,Structure of atrioventricular septum (body structure),Atrioventricular septal structure,"The entry explicitly frames the atrioventricular septum as an anatomical structure. It is a Body structure and directly matches Structure of atrioventricular septum (SCTID 14692001). The term 'septal' is adjectival and does not imply a defect or disease; it maintains a purely anatomical context. Choosing a parent like cardiac septum would be less specific, and siblings such as interatrial or interventricular septum do not fit the stated atrioventricular site. No child concept is implied."
282958005,Ability to squat (observable entity),Rehabilitation item—ability to squat,"This identifies the ability to squat as a rehabilitation assessment item, focusing on the observable capacity rather than a recorded outcome. It's an Observable entity and aligns with SNOMED CT 282958005. The rehab context does not introduce attributes like performance level or timing. Parent observables would not specify squatting, and other movement abilities are siblings, making this squat-specific ability the correct code."
257721000,Transport facility (environment),Triage location recorded: transport facility,"The triage record lists the location as a transport facility, directly mapping to Transport facility (environment), SCTID 257721000. The main concept is environmental location; the SNOMED CT category is Environment. The entry adds no extra attributes like specific station or vehicle type, ensuring it doesn’t fit a child or sibling concept. It is more precise than a generic environment code, so 257721000 is appropriate."
223822001,Crete (geographic location),From: Crete,"‘From’ is contextual and does not change the codable entity, which is the geographic location Crete. The concept falls within SNOMED CT’s Geographic location category and corresponds to Crete (geographic location) SCTID 223822001. The entry does not mention specific cities or broader areas, so neither parent nor child location concepts should be selected."
223991003,Islands of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (geographic location),Geographic location: islands of the United Kingdom,"The contextual label ""Geographic location"" does not alter the core concept, which is the islands of the United Kingdom, a Geographic location category. This aligns with SNOMED CT 223991003 because it focuses on the UK’s islands collectively, not the political country or any single island. Parent concepts covering the country are too general, child island names are too specific, and sibling regional constructs like ""British Isles"" mis-scope. The context heading simply clarifies category and does not add attributes, preserving the precise code selection."
709278001,Family education about infant development (situation),Family guidance on infant development,This expresses guidance (a clinically equivalent term for education/counseling) provided to the family about infant development. It is a Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT 709278001 best captures the combined recipient and topic. More general parents (unspecified education) or different recipient/age group siblings would be less appropriate. The term 'guidance' does not introduce new attributes such as timing or method beyond standard educational interaction.
301115008,Cardiac conduction system finding (finding),Patient reports being told of a cardiac conduction system finding,"This patient-reported statement conveys the existence of a finding pertaining to the heart’s conduction system without specifying a disorder or abnormal subtype. It maps to Cardiac conduction system finding (SCTID 301115008) as a Clinical finding. The phrasing does not introduce new attributes like severity or etiology, and it is more specific than a generic cardiac finding."
249911000,Difficulty turning body (finding),Patient reports difficulty turning around,"This patient-reported statement describes difficulty turning the body, with 'turning around' being a common description of body turning. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 249911000 fits precisely, as the entry does not specify timing, severity, cause, or setting. Broader mobility impairment concepts are not as specific, and narrower concepts like difficulty turning in bed or turning the head would be inaccurate for the stated issue."
64041000119100,Family history of complex congenital heart disease (situation),Family history recorded: complex congenital heart disease,This documentation-style entry shows that the family history has been recorded and specifies complex congenital heart disease. It falls under Situation with explicit context. Recording status does not add clinical attributes that would change coding. The use of ‘complex’ prevents mapping to the broader parent concept and the absence of a particular lesion or familial relationship detail avoids child or sibling concepts. Family history of complex congenital heart disease is the correct match.
128154006,Specimen from testis (specimen),Accessioned as testis specimen,"This entry reflects lab accessioning of a specimen sourced from the testis, aligning with “Specimen from testis.” The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It does not introduce details such as biopsy, aspirate, tissue subtype, or laterality; hence, child concepts are unwarranted. Parent concepts lack the specified origin and are less precise than explicitly identifying the testis as the source."
1306689004,Proximal interphalangeal joint prosthesis (physical object),Proximal interphalangeal joint prosthesis,"The entry explicitly names a prosthetic device designed for the proximal interphalangeal joint, without adding any attributes such as laterality, digit, material, size, brand, timing, or clinical status. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The most precise match is Proximal interphalangeal joint prosthesis (physical object) because the wording directly identifies the device type and the specific joint. Broader parent concepts like Joint prosthesis (physical object) or Interphalangeal joint prosthesis (physical object) are too generic and omit the proximal qualifier. Sibling concepts such as Distal interphalangeal joint prosthesis or devices for other joints are incorrect because the entry specifies proximal interphalangeal. No procedural or finding language (e.g., arthroplasty, presence) is introduced, so the physical object code is the best fit."
128169007,Tissue specimen from penis (specimen),Tissue specimen from penis,"This phrasing directly matches the concept name 'Tissue specimen from penis' (SCTID 128169007), clearly specifying both specimen type (tissue) and source (penis) within the Specimen hierarchy. It avoids implying method, processing, or sub-anatomic location, so it is not better mapped to children such as 'Biopsy specimen from penis' or 'Foreskin tissue specimen.' It also excludes non-tissue types, ruling out siblings like swab or fluid specimens and making broader parent concepts less precise."
286616008,Selenium intake (observable entity),Care plan focus—selenium intake,"The central concept is selenium intake; the 'care plan focus' is context, not a clinical attribute of the intake. No amount, timeframe, or source is stated. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 286616008 is appropriate because it precisely identifies the intake of selenium. Parent concepts (nutrient intake) lack specificity, and siblings (selenium exposure or lab levels, or procedural supplementation) would be incorrect. The wording remains semantically equivalent to selenium intake."
1163023001,Estimated required quantity of intake of chloride in 24 hours (observable entity),EHR field: estimated required chloride intake (24h),This field label indicates the estimated required amount of chloride intake over a 24-hour period. The main concept remains an observable estimating needed chloride intake in 24 hours. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 1163023001 is the exact match as it captures the estimated required quantity of chloride intake in 24 hours. Using an EHR context does not change the concept. Parent concepts lacking nutrient specificity or sibling observables for other nutrients would be less appropriate.
262382000,Erinaceiauriti (qualifier value),Label: Erinaceiauriti,"The key element is the value term “Erinaceiauriti.” “Label” functions as a neutral documentation context marker and does not change the concept. The main concept is the qualifier value. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This is the exact match to SCTID 262382000. Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise because the entry identifies the specific value rather than a class. No additional attributes (severity, timing, laterality) are introduced."
312232005,Pi-meson radiation (physical force),Pi-meson radiation,"The sole concept expressed is pi-meson radiation, a specific kind of particle radiation created by pi-mesons (pions). No attributes such as exposure, timing, intent, severity, or clinical consequence are added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. The most precise match is SCTID 312232005 Pi-meson radiation (physical force), because the wording explicitly specifies the radiation type. Broader parents like Radiation (physical force) are too general, and siblings such as Proton radiation or Neutron radiation are incorrect. The entry uses the preferred term directly, ensuring exact code selection."
269786000,Accidental submersion in bath (event),Unintentional submersion in bath,"‘Unintentional’ is a clinically safe synonym for ‘accidental,’ and the setting is a bath, so the concept is accidental submersion in bath. Attributes: lack of intent and bath location; no outcome. Category: Event. SCTID 269786000 is the precise code. Using a generic accidental submersion code would lose the bath detail, while choosing drowning or nonfatal submersion would add an outcome/severity not present in the wording."
88589005,Cyclocumarol (substance),Analyte name: cyclocumarol,"This presents cyclocumarol as an analyte name, still referring to the chemical substance without any measurement values or clinical interpretation. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The precise match is Cyclocumarol (substance), SCTID 88589005. Observable or finding concepts would be incorrect because no result or condition is stated. The descriptor ‘Analyte name’ simply contextualizes the substance without shifting to a different concept hierarchy."
371499003,Number of tumor fragments in specimen (observable entity),Chart entry—number of tumor fragments in specimen,"The entry indicates a charted data point: the numeric count of tumor fragments in a specimen. The main concept remains a quantitative observable; it does not introduce specimen specifics, method, or diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The charting context does not alter the underlying observable. SCTID 371499003 is appropriately specific; generic parents lack the tumor focus, and siblings that capture presence or size measure different aspects."
256693006,Steeple flap (substance),Supply item (substance): Steeple flap,"This entry clarifies that the supply item is a substance and names it. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It does not add attributes like dose, route, or reactions. Therefore SCTID 256693006 is the exact match, whereas mapping to a device/procedure or generic Substance parent would be less appropriate."
115822004,Lutheran negative phenotype (finding),Lutheran negative phenotype,"The entry states the exact concept: a negative phenotype for the Lutheran blood group system. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT. It matches SCTID 115822004 because it directly asserts absence of Lutheran blood group antigens at the phenotype level without introducing specific antigen details like Lu(a) or Lu(b). Broader parents such as general blood group findings are less precise, and children or siblings like Lutheran positive or null phenotypes would add specificity not present here."
223898005,Somerset (geographic location),Patient-reported place: Somerset,"The text indicates the patient reported the place as Somerset; the only codable concept is the geographic location Somerset, matching SCTID 223898005. The patient-reported context does not create a separate codable attribute (e.g., residency or origin); it merely identifies the named place. Category: Geographic location. Parent concepts are too broad, and no finer-grained subdivision or alternate Somerset is indicated, so siblings/children are not appropriate."
425044008,Physical exam section (record artifact),Physical examination section,"This is a clinically equivalent synonym that refers specifically to the document section where physical examination information is recorded. The concept is a Record artifact and maps to SNOMED CT 425044008. Parent concepts like generic section headings are overly general, and sibling sections (e.g., Past medical history section) are distinct. It does not imply performing the exam (procedure) or report findings (clinical findings). The synonym does not add attributes such as timing, severity, or laterality."
736482004,Major burn inpatient care plan (record artifact),Record: major burn inpatient care plan,"The phrasing states the existence of a recorded care plan for an inpatient case of major burn, emphasizing the artifact rather than care delivery. Attributes: inpatient context and major burn severity are present without adding other qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This is the most precise match for Major burn inpatient care plan; broader parents (e.g., any inpatient care plan) or siblings (e.g., outpatient major burn care plan) are less appropriate given the wording."
708034008,Church Slavic language (qualifier value),Church Slavonic,"“Church Slavonic” is a recognized synonym for Church Slavic and identifies the same language entity. The main concept is the language value; no additional attributes or clinical findings are asserted. Category: Qualifier value. Broader parents (e.g., Slavic languages) or different siblings (e.g., Croatian, Serbian) are not referenced. The synonym does not change meaning, so the correct selection remains Church Slavic language, SCTID 708034008."
408523007,Main spoken language Hakka (finding),Follow-up: patient's main spoken language continues to be Hakka.,"This follow-up note confirms that Hakka is the main spoken language, matching SNOMED CT Main spoken language Hakka (finding) [408523007]. It represents a Clinical finding. The phrasing does not introduce preference, proficiency testing, or bilingual attributes, so sibling concepts (preferred language, ability to speak) are inappropriate. General parent concepts are too broad, and the language specificity makes this code most precise."
75184002,"Visible light, electromagnetic radiation (physical force)",Visible light (electromagnetic radiation),"This phrase identifies visible light and clarifies it as electromagnetic radiation, matching the concept’s fully specified name. The main concept is visible-light EM radiation, and the SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It is preferable to parent terms like light (unspecified) or electromagnetic radiation (unspecified) because it constrains to the visible portion. It does not add attributes such as cause or intensity; the added parenthetical simply restates the semantic context inherent in the FSN."
463052009,Interlaminal internal spinal fixation system (physical object),Device: interlaminal internal spinal fixation system,"This entry identifies the device type explicitly and solely as an interlaminal internal spinal fixation system, with no added attributes about presence, site, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The mention of “Device:” does not change the concept; it simply clarifies the object class. Using a more general parent (e.g., internal spinal fixation system) would omit the interlaminal specificity, and sibling devices (e.g., interspinous devices) do not match the stated interlaminal configuration."
472962008,History of cellulitis (situation),Past medical history: cellulitis,"The phrase places cellulitis within the past medical history section, clearly indicating prior occurrence rather than present illness. The main concept is cellulitis, and the attribute is past medical history. This fits the Situation with explicit context category. The precise SNOMED match is History of cellulitis (situation), SCTID 472962008. Using active disorder codes or generic 'past medical history of infection' codes would be less specific or inaccurate given the explicit identification of cellulitis as historical."
258420003,Cyst tissue (specimen),Tissue specimen identified as cyst tissue,"The line identifies a tissue specimen specifically as cyst tissue, categorically a Specimen concept. The accurate SNOMED CT mapping is Cyst tissue (specimen) SCTID: 258420003. While 'tissue specimen' is a broader parent, the specification 'cyst tissue' refines it to the cyst-related child. It does not introduce attributes such as wall, fluid, or biopsy, so sibling/child alternatives are not more appropriate."
297362000,Azerbaijani language (qualifier value),Discharge language: Azerbaijani,"This indicates Azerbaijani as the language used for discharge materials, but the coded element is the language value. The category is Qualifier value, with Azerbaijani language (qualifier value) SCTID 297362000 as the precise code. Broader language parents do not capture specificity, and sibling language concepts would be incorrect. The entry avoids additional qualifiers like interpreter need or dialect, keeping it aligned with the base language concept."
87233003,Product containing low molecular weight heparin (product),Low molecular weight heparin on medication list,"This documentation line references a medication present on the patient’s list, identified as low molecular weight heparin. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product), with the appropriate code “Product containing low molecular weight heparin (product)” SCTID 87233003. The phrase adds context (medication list) but does not introduce dose, route, or specific agent, so it remains at the ingredient-group product level and avoids child concepts. It also excludes unfractionated heparin, ensuring a precise match. The contextual wording does not alter code selection."
437934004,Streptomyces yeochonensis (organism),Bacterium Streptomyces yeochonensis,"Main concept: organism classified as a bacterium, specifically Streptomyces yeochonensis. No attributes about infection, source, or timing are included. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The exact match is Streptomyces yeochonensis (organism), SCTID 437934004. Parent categories such as Bacteria (organism) or Streptomyces (genus) are less specific. Adding “Bacterium” is a classification descriptor consistent with the species that does not introduce a different concept and thus does not change the code."
715163003,Diphtheria vaccination contraindicated (situation),Contraindicated—diphtheria vaccination,"This succinct status statement directly associates the contraindication with diphtheria vaccination, matching the Situation concept SCTID 715163003. It does not mention causative factors or related vaccines. More general parent concepts lack the diphtheria specificity, and sibling concepts involving other actions (deferral/refusal) or other vaccine types are not applicable."
223907005,West Midlands (geographic location),"The West Midlands, England","This names the geographic location West Midlands and clarifies the country subdivision England. It belongs to the Location hierarchy as a Geographic location. The best code is West Midlands (geographic location) [223907005]. England is included for context and should not replace the specific place in coding. The text does not introduce a narrower locality or a different regional sibling, confirming the appropriateness of the West Midlands concept."
242226009,Crash landing of manned kite (event),Indication: crash landing of manned kite,"Listed as an indication, the entry still denotes the same event: crash landing with a manned kite. It avoids extra attributes (e.g., timing, injuries). The SNOMED CT category is Event, and 242226009 is the exact match. More general parents or siblings that remove the landing phase or change the conveyance would not be appropriate. The indication context does not change the concept; it remains the specific crash-landing event."
450511006,Manipulation of joint using traction (procedure),Joint manipulation employing traction,"The concept here is a procedure where traction is employed to manipulate a joint. Category: Procedure. It matches SNOMED CT 450511006 because it combines manipulation with traction and does not specify site, laterality, indication, or timing. Parent concepts lacking the traction detail are less precise, and sibling concepts such as “Joint traction” do not include the manipulation aspect. The phrase “employing traction” is semantically equivalent to “using traction.”"
251209009,Shortened ST segment (finding),Reduced ST-segment duration,"The entry articulates the attribute of reduced time of the ST segment, which is semantically identical to “shortened ST segment,” without adding extra qualifiers. It belongs to the Clinical finding hierarchy, and SCTID 251209009 is the exact match. Parent concepts about general ECG abnormalities are less precise, and siblings involving ST morphology (depression/elevation) or QT interval changes are different phenomena. “Reduced duration” is a clear, equivalent description of shortening."
444460003,Exposure to bacterial vaginosis (event),Follow-up regarding exposure to bacterial vaginosis,"The phrase indicates a follow-up context but the clinical concept remains exposure to bacterial vaginosis, not an illness or symptom. This is an Event in SNOMED CT. SCTID 444460003 is the precise code, as it denotes exposure to BV. Parent concepts are less specific, and sibling concepts such as exposure to vaginitis or bacterial infection would be imprecise. The follow-up context does not introduce attributes that change the concept."
399741007,Specimen from kidney obtained by radical nephrectomy (specimen),Received in pathology: kidney specimen procured via radical nephrectomy.,"The entry indicates receipt in pathology of a kidney specimen and explicitly states the procurement method was radical nephrectomy. This is a Specimen-type concept. The appropriate SNOMED CT code is “Specimen from kidney obtained by radical nephrectomy (specimen),” as it captures both origin and method. A parent such as “Kidney specimen” is insufficiently specific, and siblings involving non-radical nephrectomy or biopsy would not be accurate given the wording. The verb “procured via” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “obtained by” and does not alter the code selection."
274031008,Rectal polypectomy (procedure),Surgical report: rectal polypectomy,"This is a reporting context label that still denotes the procedure 'rectal polypectomy.' The concept is Procedure, accurately represented by SNOMED CT 274031008. No technique (endoscopic vs. open), number of polyps, or timing context is specified, avoiding child or situational codes. The site 'rectal' makes it more specific than a parent polypectomy and distinct from siblings affecting other gastrointestinal segments."
445664008,Amended report (record artifact),Chart shows an amended report,"This entry states that the chart contains an amended report, focusing on the amended report artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It aligns with Amended report (record artifact) [445664008]; mentioning the chart is contextual and does not add attributes that would alter the code selection. It avoids domain-specific types and distinct statuses like addended or corrected."
727339002,Entire dorsal skin of penis (body structure),Entire dorsal penile cutaneous tissue,"This entry denotes the cutaneous tissue (skin) of the dorsal aspect of the penis and includes the entire structure. The key concepts are tissue type (cutaneous/skin), anatomical site (penis), orientation (dorsal), and extent (entire). It is a Body structure and accurately maps to 'Entire dorsal skin of penis.' Using 'cutaneous tissue' keeps the focus on skin, avoiding broader structures like fascia or surface-only siblings. No extra clinical attributes are introduced."
102774009,"Macromolecular creatine kinase, type 2 (substance)",MacroCK type 2,"The merged acronym 'MacroCK' is a stylistic synonym for macromolecular creatine kinase; 'type 2' preserves the exact subtype. The entry conveys only the identity of the substance, with no added attributes, and thus fits a Substance category concept. SCTID 102774009 corresponds to macro-CK type 2 specifically. Choosing a parent concept (e.g., creatine kinase) or a sibling (macro-CK type 1) would not match the stated type. There is no implication of presence, abnormality, or test ordering, avoiding misclassification as a finding or procedure."
7871006,Lampropeltis calligaster (organism),Kingsnake species—Lampropeltis calligaster,"The phrase indicates the animal is a kingsnake and provides the specific species name Lampropeltis calligaster, without adding clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. While 'kingsnake' is a common grouping, the inclusion of the exact binomial ensures the species-level code is appropriate, not the parent genus or a sibling species. No subspecies are mentioned."
223794004,Cork - county (geographic location),County—Cork,"The construction 'County—Cork' explicitly designates Cork as the county, a geographic location entity. Category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223794004 is the precise match. Broader parents lack specificity, and siblings like Cork city or non-county Cork entities are excluded by the explicit 'County' qualifier. The dash formatting does not introduce new attributes; it simply separates label and value."
397766003,Wrong dose of medication given (event),Wrong dosage administered,"The statement indicates a medication was administered and the dosage was wrong, directly reflecting the intended concept. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It does not specify over- or under-dosing, a particular substance, route, or timing, thereby avoiding child or sibling concepts like overdose or underdose. “Wrong dosage” is a synonymous expression of “wrong dose,” making 397766003 the precise match rather than a broader medication error category."
51291000087101,Antigen of Orthopneumovirus hominis recombinant surface glycoprotein F (substance),Human respiratory syncytial virus recombinant F surface glycoprotein antigen,"The phrase clearly states human respiratory syncytial virus (synonym of Orthopneumovirus hominis) and specifies the recombinant surface glycoprotein F antigen, which is a Substance. This exactness avoids mapping to a parent like generic RSV antigen or to siblings like G glycoprotein antigen, and it does not add attributes such as conformation or formulation. The synonym use (HRSV for Orthopneumovirus hominis) is standard and clinically equivalent."
404232001,24 hour voided urinary volume (observable entity),24-hour urine output volume,"The term refers to the volume of urine output summed over 24 hours, identifying the same observable property. This belongs to the Observable entity category and is best coded to 24 hour voided urinary volume (SCTID 404232001). Using “urine output” as a synonym is customary and does not introduce a procedural aspect or a different timeframe. Parent concepts lacking the 24-hour specification or procedural measurement codes would be less precise than this time-bounded observable."
242454004,Accident caused by fumes from burning polyurethane in conflagration on commercial premises (event),Witness statement: accident due to fumes from burning polyurethane during a conflagration on business premises,"A witness narrative that still includes accident, fumes from burning polyurethane, conflagration, and business premises (commercial premises). Category: Event. The synonyms are clinically equivalent and do not change attributes. SCTID 242454004 is the most precise code; parent/sibling concepts lacking any of these components would be less appropriate."
282339007,Unit of platelet analysis (qualifier value),Unit label: platelet analysis,"This wording denotes a unit label in the context of platelet analysis, with no specific unit or parameter introduced. The main concept is the unit designation associated with platelet analytical results. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It matches 282339007 because it captures the general class of units used for platelet analysis, avoiding specificity. A broader unit parent lacks the platelet analysis qualifier, while parameter-specific unit concepts would be too narrow. The phrase is a neutral paraphrase that remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
248789005,Quality of orgasm (observable entity),Sexual function questionnaire: orgasm quality,"Framed as a questionnaire item, the core concept remains the observable attribute 'quality of orgasm' without any result or abnormality stated. This maps to Quality of orgasm (Observable entity, SCTID 248789005). It does not introduce procedure coding, as it labels the variable measured rather than an action performed. Using different attributes (e.g., orgasm frequency) or pathological findings (e.g., anorgasmia) would miscode the intent, confirming 248789005 as the precise selection."
1353031006,Union for International Cancer Control rcT3b (qualifier value),Oncology note: UICC rcT3b assigned,"This documentation-style entry records the assignment of UICC rcT3b, the recurrent clinical T3b category in TNM. It is a Qualifier value and corresponds directly to SNOMED CT 1353031006. The rc prefix ensures the recurrent clinical context, distinguishing it from cT3b or pT3b. It is more specific than rcT or rcT3 parent concepts, and no additional attributes are implied."
245048003,Structure of tendon of head and neck (body structure),Tendon of the head-and-neck area (anatomy),"The wording identifies a tendon belonging to the head-and-neck area and explicitly frames it as anatomical. This makes it a Body structure and appropriately maps to 'Structure of tendon of head and neck.' It avoids additional attributes and leaves the tendon unnamed, preventing an overly specific child mapping. Parent terms like general tendon structures do not capture the region. The phrasing is a synonymous paraphrase."
249120008,Onset of labor first stage (observable entity),"Onset of labor, first stage","This wording exactly matches the preferred concept, identifying the start of the first stage of labor as an observable event. It includes no added qualifiers like induced/spontaneous or latent/active phase. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 249120008 is directly appropriate. Parent concepts such as ""Onset of labor"" are too general, while child or sibling concepts related to subphases (latent/active) would be too narrow given the entry."
85949006,Euphoria (finding),Euphoric state,"“Euphoric state” conveys the presence of euphoria as the clinical finding, without adding severity or duration. The category is Clinical finding. Euphoria (finding) SCTID 85949006 is the correct match because it encodes euphoria specifically. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling terms (e.g., elevated mood, mania) carry different or additional characteristics. The word “state” here is descriptive and does not introduce new attributes."
423134005,Plan section (record artifact),EHR document Plan section,"The entry points to the Plan section within an EHR document, a labeled section artifact. In SNOMED CT, this fits Plan section (record artifact) [423134005], under the Record artifact category. The reference to an EHR document is contextual and does not change semantics to a care plan or a combined section. Parent concepts like generic document sections would be too broad, and siblings such as Assessment and plan section or Plan of care section are not indicated. Hence, 423134005."
285324001,Neutron radiation (physical force),Physical agent—neutron radiation,"Calling it a 'physical agent' and naming it 'neutron radiation' conveys the same physical-force concept without adding attributes such as exposure, dose, or energy specification. The most accurate SNOMED CT code is Neutron radiation (physical force), SCTID 285324001, categorized as a Physical force. Parent concepts are too general, and children with energy qualifiers would be too specific. The wording does not introduce procedural or situational context, preventing misclassification."
217304007,Jump from burning lodging house (event),Patient describes a jump from the burning lodging house,"This patient description retains the essential components: a jump and the burning lodging house context. The most precise SNOMED CT code is 217304007 (Event). Using a parent such as general building fire or jumping from any building would lose the lodging house specificity, and siblings for other structures or different mechanisms would be incorrect. The phrasing does not add intent, severity, or timing attributes; it is a direct description of the event."
313079007,Counseling for homosexuality (procedure),Counseling session addressing homosexuality,"This indicates a counseling session whose content addressed homosexuality, i.e., the counseling procedure with that specific focus. It falls under Procedure and corresponds to SCTID 313079007. The term ‘session’ does not introduce a different modality; it reinforces that counseling occurred. Broader or different concepts (generic counseling, sexual counseling, psychotherapy) would be less precise. No additional attributes like timeframe or setting are introduced."
108389007,Acetylcarbromal (substance),Acetylcarbromal identified as the API,"API refers to active pharmaceutical ingredient, which denotes the specific chemical entity acetylcarbromal without describing a particular medicinal product. This aligns with the Substance hierarchy in SNOMED CT and should be coded as Acetylcarbromal (substance) [108389007]. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too general or chemically different. No strength, form, or route is mentioned, ruling out product codes."
428582006,History of operative procedure on lumbar spinal structure (situation),Past history of lumbar spinal procedure,"The entry denotes a past history involving a procedure on the lumbar spinal structure, equating to a completed operative procedure in the lumbar spine. Category: Situation with explicit context (situation). Code 428582006 is the precise match because it encodes the historical context and lumbar focus. Parent concepts lacking a lumbar designation are overly broad, and child concepts specifying procedure type or levels are not supported. ""Procedure"" is used in the operative sense here and is clinically consistent with the concept without changing attributes."
422281007,Utah (geographic location),Place name: Utah,"“Place name: Utah” conveys the toponym without introducing relationships (e.g., residence or origin), mapping uniquely to Utah (geographic location) SCTID 422281007. The main concept is the geographic location as a named place. Category: Geographic location (environment). Parent concepts such as United States of America are too broad, and child concepts such as specific cities in Utah are too narrow. The label “Place name” is contextual and does not create a different concept; the exact code remains 422281007."
311802005,Ocular approaches (qualifier value),History note: prior procedure approach was ocular,"The history entry reports that a prior procedure used an ocular approach, mapping to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value 'Ocular approaches'. No detail about specific ocular routes is presented, so child concepts are not applicable. It is contextually procedural and not related to medication administration, excluding 'Ocular route'. A more general parent approach concept would be less precise, making 'Ocular approaches' the most accurate selection."
362110007,Entire pulp of tooth (body structure),All of the pulp of the tooth,"The phrase explicitly refers to the full anatomical structure of the tooth’s pulp by stating “all.” This is a Body structure and maps to SCTID 362110007 because it denotes the entire pulp rather than any portion. The parent “pulp of tooth” would be less exact, and sibling concepts for subregions (coronal/root pulp, pulp chamber) do not match the stated totality. The synonym “all” is equivalent to “entire” for scope and does not add extraneous clinical details."
469480008,Ionic manual toothbrush (physical object),Ionic hand toothbrush (manual).,"“Hand toothbrush” informally denotes manual operation, and the parenthetical “manual” removes any ambiguity, while “ionic” captures the technology. As a Physical object, this maps to “Ionic manual toothbrush.” Broader parents (hand/manual toothbrush without ionic) and powered ionic siblings are less appropriate. The synonym choice does not alter attributes beyond confirming manual operation and ionic technology, keeping the code selection precise."
1431000175100,Tobacco cessation treatment history (observable entity),Documentation of tobacco cessation treatment history,"This entry states that the patient’s history of treatment to stop tobacco use is documented, clearly a historical observation. In SNOMED CT, this is an Observable entity and precisely corresponds to Tobacco cessation treatment history. It avoids details like modality, timing, or outcomes, so neither parent generic history codes nor child procedure-specific concepts are more appropriate."
411698002,Helix aspersa diagnostic allergen extract (product),Label reads “Helix aspersa diagnostic allergen extract”,"The statement quotes a product label naming Helix aspersa diagnostic allergen extract, directly identifying the species-specific diagnostic allergen product. SNOMED CT category: Product. This maps to SCTID 411698002 because the label exactly matches the preferred term concept. A broader label (e.g., “snail extract”) would be too generic, and other species labels would be siblings. The labeling context does not change the product identity."
114539003,Salmonella Livingstone var 14+ (organism),Salmonella Livingstone var 14+ bacterium,"Adding “bacterium” simply describes the biological class while retaining the precise organism designation: Salmonella Livingstone var 14+. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This corresponds to concept 114539003 and excludes any clinical findings or attributes (site, severity, time). Broader Salmonella or Livingstone without variant is less specific, and other variants would be incorrect. Hence, the organism variant concept is the most accurate match."
1157114001,Neuropacemaker clinic (environment),Neuro-pacemaker clinic,"This entry is a hyphenated variant of “Neuropacemaker clinic” and denotes the same clinic environment; there are no added attributes. It belongs to the Environment or geographical location category. The wording targets SCTID 1157114001 specifically, rather than broader clinic concepts or device clinics. It does not imply a cardiac pacemaker clinic or a general neuromodulation service, so parent or sibling concepts would be less precise. Hyphenation does not alter the clinical meaning and remains equivalent to the preferred term."
394965000,Urine leukocyte test not done (situation),Urine white blood cell test not performed,"The entry references a test for white blood cells (leukocytes) in urine and indicates it was not carried out. The main concept is the urine leukocyte test with a non-performance attribute, which is a Situation. The precise SNOMED code is 394965000. Broader parents like Urinalysis not done or Procedure not done lack the leukocyte specificity, and method-specific siblings (e.g., microscopy for WBC not done) add unspoken method attributes. 'White blood cell' is a clinically equivalent term for leukocyte, so the wording remains within the same concept without altering attributes."
181127006,Entire adrenal gland (body structure),Entire adrenal gland (anatomical structure),"The parenthetical clarifies the ontological type, and 'entire' denotes the whole single gland. Category: Body structure. This maps directly to 'Entire adrenal gland' and avoids ambiguity with partial structures or laterality. More general parents or specific children (cortex/medulla, left/right) are not indicated."
91071007,Gravity (physical force),Gravity referenced,"Although contextual, the entry still denotes the concept of gravity and does not introduce any attribute beyond acknowledgment. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and Gravity (physical force) [91071007] is the precise match. Parent or sibling concepts are not indicated, and no magnitude, timing, causation, or clinical consequences are provided, so the code remains 91071007."
122732007,Specimen from thyroid obtained by lobectomy (specimen),Specimen source: thyroid; obtained by lobectomy,"This entry explicitly lists the specimen source as the thyroid and the procurement as lobectomy. The key concepts are specimen origin and method, consistent with the Specimen category in SNOMED CT. The best match is SCTID 122732007 because it requires both source and lobectomy procedure. Parent concepts without method are insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts indicating other procedures (e.g., total thyroidectomy or FNA) mismap the intent. The structured phrasing is documentation style and does not add extrinsic attributes."
360064003,Ventricular assist device (physical object),Ventricular assist device unit,"The term 'unit' is a neutral synonym indicating a singular physical device, here specifically a ventricular assist device. This resides in the Physical object category. SCTID 360064003 is the most accurate mapping, since no additional attributes (laterality, model, system components) are introduced. Children like LVAD/RVAD or system-level concepts would be overly specific or different from the generic device object."
370115009,Special concept (special concept),Concept type: special concept,"This entry describes the type of the concept as 'special concept,' which directly references the SNOMED CT meta-category. The main concept is the classification label 'Special concept.' The SNOMED CT category is Special concept. SCTID 370115009 is the most precise match because it denotes the special concept semantic tag itself. It would be inappropriate to code to 'Navigational concept' or any qualifier value since the entry does not assert navigational, unknown, or not-applicable semantics—only the base special concept type."
246432004,Number of occurrences (qualifier value),Occurrence count,"This entry conveys the idea of a tally of occurrences—how many times something occurred—without indicating what occurred, when, or any numeric value. The category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 246432004 is the most precise code because the term is explicitly about occurrences rather than a generic number. It avoids the sibling 'Frequency,' which would imply per-unit time, and does not introduce context such as episodes or doses that would point to a more specific child concept. 'Occurrence count' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'Number of occurrences.'"
722140001,Physiotherapy service (qualifier value),Service type: Physiotherapy service,"This entry clearly presents the value selected for the 'service type' field as physiotherapy, indicating a categorical service descriptor only. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. 722140001 is the correct code because it represents that exact service type. Broader parents (e.g., rehabilitation service) and different siblings (e.g., occupational therapy service) would not match the specified discipline. It does not describe a procedure, event, or referral, so procedure or request concepts are less appropriate."
385365000,International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage for epithelial tumor of ovary (observable entity),FIGO stage for epithelial neoplasm of ovary,"This restates the observable as the FIGO stage for an epithelial ovarian neoplasm, maintaining equivalence with epithelial ovarian tumor. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The synonym 'neoplasm' does not alter the code selection, keeping the mapping to SCTID 385365000. It avoids generic parents and specific stage children, and excludes non-epithelial ovarian tumor siblings."
251128005,Atrioventricular nodal effective refractory period (observable entity),Effective refractory period of the AV node,This is a descriptive synonym that spells out the effective refractory period and the structure (AV node). It represents the same Observable entity as SNOMED CT 251128005. The entry avoids additional qualifiers such as normality or values. Using “effective” specifically excludes siblings such as absolute or functional refractory periods and ensures this does not map to a broader parent concept of AV nodal refractory period.
102420004,Exposure to pollution (event),Exposure due to pollution,"This phrasing conveys that the exposure is related to pollution, consistent with the event concept and without specifying the type of pollution. It is classified as an Event. The correct code is 'Exposure to pollution (event)' [102420004]. Using a broader exposure code would reduce precision, while selecting pollutant-specific child codes would over-specify. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent to exposure to pollution."
223722005,Suriname (geographic location),Residence: Suriname,"The entry identifies Suriname as the place of residence, making the central concept the country as a Geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Location; the precise code is Suriname (geographic location), SCTID 223722005. While the context is ‘residence,’ the codable value for place is the country itself; no city or region is specified, so children are not implied, and broader parents are unnecessary. The country-level Suriname concept is the best fit."
49225009,Change in bone length of tibia and fibula (procedure),Adjustment in bone length of tibia and fibula,"Main concept: procedural adjustment of the bone length for both tibia and fibula. Attributes: bones specified and length adjustment; no direction, laterality, or etiology included. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The most precise code is SCTID 49225009, representing change in bone length for both tibia and fibula. Parent or broader procedure codes lack bone specificity. Child codes that indicate lengthening or shortening introduce direction not present. Sibling codes involving only one of the bones are not sufficient because both are documented here. 'Adjustment' equals 'change' clinically and does not alter the concept."
788096005,Intentional excessive dose of vaccine administered (event),Vaccine administered in intentionally excessive dose,"This entry describes a vaccine administration where the dose was intentionally excessive. The explicit attributes are vaccine, administered, excessive dose, and intentionality. Category: Event. The code 788096005 is exact, as it denotes intentional excessive dosing of a vaccine that has occurred. A parent concept like excessive vaccine dose without specifying intent would be less precise, and sibling concepts for accidental excess or underdose do not match the wording. The phrasing uses standard clinical language that is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
462465001,"Hemodialysis chair, electric (physical object)",Electric hemodialysis treatment chair,"The entry specifies a chair used for hemodialysis treatment and states it is electric, which directly aligns with Hemodialysis chair, electric (SCTID 462465001). Category: Physical object/device. The word “treatment” is contextually descriptive but does not add unrelated attributes; it clarifies the intended use without changing the concept. Non-electric or generic dialysis chairs would be broader, and other modality chairs would be incorrect, so this code is the precise match."
788198008,Structure of hair follicle of penis (body structure),Pilar follicle of the penis,"The term 'pilar follicle' is a recognized synonym for hair follicle. Specifying 'of the penis' makes the location explicit. This is a Body structure and best maps to 'Structure of hair follicle of penis' (788198008). Broader anatomical parents lack the penile site, while siblings like 'Structure of hair of penis' (if present) would refer to hair rather than the follicle. The synonym does not introduce new attributes."
262305000,With separation (qualifier value),Report remark: with separation,"Main concept: a report remark records the qualifier 'with separation.' SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. Justification: The remark is a modifier phrase, not a standalone condition, and matches With separation (qualifier value) [262305000]. No added attributes are present. Choosing a sibling qualifier or a separate 'separation' finding would miscode the entry; the exact phrasing supports the qualifier value selection."
781195004,Suture line inflamed (finding),Suture line is inflamed,"This straightforward statement specifies inflammation at the suture line and fits the Clinical finding Suture line inflamed (781195004). It does not introduce additional attributes such as etiology, severity, timing, or associated complications. Parent concepts lack the site specificity, and siblings like infection or disruption would incorrectly imply features not stated."
422403005,Product containing dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (product),Medication record: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor product,"In a record context, the clinical content is a product from the DPP-4 inhibitor class, consistent with a product-level representation. No specific gliptin, combination therapy, dose, route, or indication is provided, making SCTID 422403005 appropriate under Pharmaceutical/biologic product. Parent or sibling classes would be either too broad or different, and child concepts would be too specific. The wording directly corresponds to the preferred term using standardized hyphenation and does not change the intended code."
411634003,Bertholletia excelsa diagnostic allergen extract (product),Bertholletia excelsa allergen extract for allergy diagnostics,"The entry describes an allergen extract from Bertholletia excelsa intended for allergy diagnostics, which fits the SNOMED Pharmaceutical/biologic product 'Bertholletia excelsa diagnostic allergen extract' (411634003). It avoids specifying test method or outcome, preventing drift to child concepts. Parent classes without the source allergen are too general, and other source-specific sibling products are not appropriate. The phrase is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of diagnostic allergen extract."
83051006,Cimetidine hydrochloride (substance),Cimetidine hydrochloride (HCl),"The entry provides both the full term and its HCl abbreviation, explicitly identifying the hydrochloride salt of cimetidine. No dose, route, or product form is implied. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This aligns exactly with SCTID 83051006; parent/sibling concepts like the base cimetidine or product concepts are not indicated and would be less precise."
241196006,Facet joint arthrogram (procedure),Spinal facet joint arthrogram,"The wording identifies a facet joint of the spine and specifies an arthrogram. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Facet joints are inherently spinal, so adding 'spinal' does not introduce a new attribute beyond the inherent anatomy. This maps most precisely to Facet joint arthrogram (241196006). Parent concepts like unspecified joint arthrogram are too broad, while children indicating cervical or lumbar levels would be overly specific. No guidance method or laterality is stated, avoiding sibling or child mappings."
224707008,Cellar (environment),Work setting: cellar,"The phrase denotes the work-related setting as the cellar, but the primary concept remains the environmental place ‘cellar.’ It maps to Cellar (environment) [224707008]. Category: Environment or geographical location. ‘Work setting’ is contextual and does not change the environment being coded. Parent environment categories would be too broad, and alternative indoor locations are not referenced, so the cellar environment concept is the most precise code."
280389005,Entire interarytenoid fold (body structure),Documentation entry—interarytenoid fold,"The statement records the anatomical structure, the interarytenoid fold, without adding diagnostic or procedural attributes. It falls under Body structure. SCTID 280389005 is the proper code, representing the entire fold. Parents such as 'Structure of larynx' or 'Interarytenoid area' are too broad, and siblings like 'Vocal fold' or 'Interarytenoid notch' are different structures. Child concepts denoting parts of the fold would be narrower than intended. The 'documentation entry' descriptor is contextual and does not change the underlying anatomical concept."
63529002,Camelpox virus (organism),Report header: Camelpox virus,"The entry specifies Camelpox virus as a header context, yet the entity remains the organism itself. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 63529002 is appropriate because it identifies the species. Parent concepts (Orthopoxvirus, Poxviridae) lack the necessary specificity, and disorder codes for camelpox would be incorrect since no disease is indicated. The header context does not introduce detection or other attributes."
242040000,Physical abuse of elderly person (event),Radiology impression: physical abuse of elderly person,"Though phrased as an imaging report impression, the content is explicit: physical abuse involving an elderly person. It states the modality and the age group without adding other attributes like mechanism or timing. SNOMED CT category: Event. The precise match is SCTID 242040000; coding to nonaccidental injury or to unspecified elder abuse would be less accurate because the entry names physical abuse directly."
45557004,Serranus subligarius (organism),Serranus subligarius,"The entry explicitly names the species Serranus subligarius, which is a taxonomic organism. The main concept is the species-level organism without any clinical modifiers. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This maps most precisely to SCTID 45557004 because it specifies the exact species, rather than a broader parent concept such as Serranus (genus) or Serranidae (family) or a sibling species within Serranus. No additional attributes (e.g., exposure, disease, timing) are introduced, keeping the code selection strictly at the organism level."
258506007,Swab of drain insertion site (specimen),Drain insertion site swab (specimen),"Main concept: explicitly noted specimen that is a swab from the drain insertion site. Attributes: swab specimen; drain insertion site origin. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This exactly mirrors the preferred term and maps to 258506007. Parent or generic swab concepts are insufficiently specific, and siblings for other sources (e.g., drain tip swab) do not match a site swab. The parenthetical “(specimen)” reinforces category without changing meaning."
1381281006,Debulking of neoplasm of peritoneum (procedure),Consent obtained for debulking of neoplasm of peritoneum,"This consent documentation indicates the planned procedure is debulking of a peritoneal neoplasm, identifying both the procedural type and site. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps directly to Debulking of neoplasm of peritoneum (1381281006) because it specifies cytoreductive intent at the peritoneal location. Parent concepts without site are overly general, and siblings or children that add approach or malignant histology are not stated here. The wording avoids extra clinical attributes, maintaining exactness."
442173007,Urine specimen from nephrostomy tube (specimen),Nephrostomy tube urine specimen,"The concept expressed is a urine specimen obtained from a nephrostomy tube; the wording is concise but unambiguous. This belongs to the Specimen category. SCTID 442173007 directly represents this specimen type and source. A broader parent like 'Urine specimen' would be under-specified, while siblings involving bladder catheters or urostomies refer to different sources. The reordering of terms is a pure synonym and maintains the same meaning without adding attributes."
730663007,Entire short posterior ciliary nerve (body structure),Short posterior ciliary nerve — complete,"The term 'complete' functions as a synonym of 'entire,' emphasizing the whole nerve. No clinical findings, laterality, or other attributes are introduced. This is a Body structure and maps to SCTID 730663007. Parent concepts are broader and siblings like 'long posterior ciliary nerve' are explicitly excluded by 'short.' The entry does not refer to a partial structure."
223364007,Building with multiple dwellings (environment),Multifamily residential building,"Main concept: a residential building configured for multiple families, i.e., multiple dwelling units. No further attributes are included. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. 'Multifamily residential building' is a standard synonym for a building with multiple dwellings and maps to 223364007. A broader parent like 'residential building' does not imply multiple dwelling units and would be less precise. A child concept such as 'apartment building' would be more specific than the wording here, so 223364007 is the correct level of specificity."
346364006,Cat allergy vaccine (product),Allergen vaccine targeting cat allergy,"Describes a vaccine product whose target is cat allergy, preserving the product semantics. The SNOMED CT category is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The code Cat allergy vaccine (product) [346364006] is most precise given the explicitly stated allergen target. Parent concepts are broader; siblings for other allergens do not match; no child-level attributes like component or route are included."
223568006,Sierra Leone (geographic location),Country: Sierra Leone,"The label indicates the field type, and the value is Sierra Leone. The main concept to code is the country name itself. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The correct code is 223568006 Sierra Leone (geographic location). The contextual label 'Country:' does not shift the mapping to an observable or to a different concept; it simply frames the location value. No broader or narrower place is implied."
180698000,Postauricular flap (substance),Post-auricular flap,"This hyphenated form describes the same tissue flap from the area behind the ear, indicating a specific flap material. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, reflecting the material rather than a procedure. It maps most precisely to Postauricular flap (substance), SCTID 180698000. Parent concepts like generic tissue flap materials are less specific, and siblings involving other donor regions are not appropriate. The hyphen does not change meaning, introduce laterality, timing, or technique, so the code selection remains the same."
328692009,Gluten-free high fiber crackers (product),Food preference: gluten-free high-fiber crackers,"The preference notes a product choice of crackers that are gluten-free and high fiber, categorized as a Product. SCTID 328692009 is the exact match for this item. Broader cracker concepts or alternatives missing one attribute would be less precise. The preference context does not add any new product attributes."
48601000087102,Hammock style bath chair (physical object),Order placed for hammock style bath chair,"The entry is an ordering context but names the device specifically as a hammock style bath chair, exactly matching Hammock style bath chair (physical object), SCTID 48601000087102. Main concept: the specified physical object; attribute: hammock style. Category: Physical object. The ordering context does not change the object being coded. A parent-level bath chair would be less specific, and sibling devices (e.g., shower chair) are not referenced. Thus, the precise concept is appropriate."
300313001,Normal rectum (finding),Rectum normal,"This is a succinct documentation of a normal status of the rectum, with no added severity, cause, or associated conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps exactly to 300313001 (Normal rectum), as it conveys the same concept in a compact phrasing. Alternatives such as procedure-result concepts (e.g., normal rectal exam) or substructure-specific normals (e.g., mucosa) would be less appropriate because they imply methods or parts not mentioned."
258657000,Semi-skimmed milk specimen (specimen),Partly skimmed milk specimen,"This entry uses 'partly skimmed' to describe the milk specimen, which is synonymous with semi-skimmed milk. The main concept is the specimen type being semi-skimmed milk, without added attributes such as volume or origin. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. 'Partly skimmed' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase and does not change code selection, so SCTID 258657000 is appropriate. The parent Milk specimen would be too broad, and sibling concepts for skimmed or whole milk would not match the partial skimming specified."
315371003,Entire lumbosacral spinal cord white matter (body structure),"White matter of lumbosacral spinal cord, complete","The phrase identifies the white matter tissue and the lumbosacral spinal level, with “complete” indicating the whole extent. This is an anatomical Body structure and maps precisely to SNOMED CT 315371003. Broader parents (white matter of entire spinal cord) would include additional regions; narrower siblings (lumbar-only or sacral-only) miss part of the lumbosacral span. The synonym “complete” is equivalent to “entire” and does not change the concept."
130764003,Mimosinase (substance),Mimosinase entry,"The term identifies the specific substance mimosinase; “entry” merely indicates a record listing without adding any product or clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. A generic parent concept would be less specific, and no sibling entity is implied. Thus, Mimosinase (substance) with SCTID 130764003 is the exact match."
1155708003,Low histologic grade (qualifier value),Previously documented low histologic grade,"This entry references a prior record but still only conveys that the histologic grade is low, with no added specifics. The category is Qualifier value, and the best match remains 'Low histologic grade (qualifier value)' SCTID 1155708003. A generic 'histologic grade' parent lacks the specified value, while sibling qualifiers (high/moderate) would be inconsistent. Numeric grade children are not mentioned, making the broader low-grade qualifier appropriate. The temporal context ('previously') does not change the qualifier value."
706127002,Freestanding patient positioner (physical object),Patient statement: “They put me in a freestanding patient positioner.”,"A patient-reported description identifies a freestanding patient positioner used during care. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Despite the narrative style, the core concept is a freestanding positioner, mapping directly to SCTID 706127002. The statement does not imply a modality-specific or mounted device, so parent or sibling codes are less appropriate."
226122007,High simple carbohydrate diet (finding),Food intake described as high in simple carbohydrates,"The entry describes food intake that is high in simple carbohydrates, capturing the dietary finding of increased simple carbohydrate consumption. Attributes present are intake context, nutrient type (simple carbohydrates), and quantity (high). This is a Clinical finding and best mapped to High simple carbohydrate diet (226122007). Parent concepts like high carbohydrate diet lack the explicit restriction to simple carbs, while children focusing on specific sugars would be overly restrictive. The wording is a paraphrase that maintains equivalence without adding attributes."
223618008,United Arab Emirates (geographic location),Address country field: United Arab Emirates,"Despite the context of an address field, the value to be coded is the geographic location United Arab Emirates. In SNOMED CT, this maps to Location, specifically Geographic location. The precise concept is United Arab Emirates (geographic location), SCTID 223618008. Parent concepts (e.g., Country) are too general, and emirate-level children are too specific. Sibling countries are different entities. The address context does not alter the semantic content of the place name."
298321008,Past pointing present (situation),Past pointing: present.,"This is a succinct status statement that the condition 'past pointing' is present, framing it as an outcome. The SNOMED CT category is Situation, and the best match is Past pointing present (situation) [298321008]. Using the colon and the term 'present' removes ambiguity and avoids mapping to the broader finding. It contains no added attributes that would warrant a child or sibling code."
162154003,No urethral discharge (situation),No urethral secretions observed,"This exam-oriented statement indicates no secretions from the urethra, which is clinically synonymous with no urethral discharge. The concept is a negated finding and fits the Situation category. SCTID 162154003 is the best match since 'secretions' here does not imply a specific quality or cause, just the absence of discharge. Broader or alternative anatomical concepts are less appropriate."
1141921003,Exploratory blunt needle (physical object),Exploratory blunt needle,"The entry explicitly names the physical object as an exploratory blunt needle, capturing the essential attributes of use designation (“exploratory”), tip type (“blunt”), and device class (“needle”). The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This wording precisely matches SNOMED CT concept 1141921003 and is more specific than parent concepts like Needle (physical object) or Blunt needle (physical object). It does not introduce child-level attributes such as size, gauge, material, or specialized subtype (e.g., suture, hypodermic, biopsy), ensuring the exact concept is the most appropriate mapping."
309050000,Body substance specimen (specimen),Bodily substance specimen,"Using 'bodily' as a synonym for 'body' preserves the meaning and maps to the same SNOMED CT concept 309050000 in the Specimen hierarchy. No specific substance is named, and no attributes like severity, timing, or related conditions are introduced. This avoids more specific child concepts and does not imply fluid or tissue, thus not mapping to sibling categories. The phrase remains an exact general descriptor of a body substance specimen."
706871001,Poor response to enteral nutrition (situation),Poor response to enteral nutrition,"The entry expresses a single concept: the patient has a poor response to enteral nutrition. No additional attributes such as cause, severity beyond “poor,” timing, or associated conditions are included. This fits the SNOMED CT category Situation with explicit context, reflecting the clinical situation of suboptimal therapeutic effect to a specific intervention. SCTID 706871001 “Poor response to enteral nutrition (situation)” is the most precise match because it directly encodes this response linked to enteral nutrition. Broader parents like generic poor response to treatment would be insufficiently specific, and siblings such as intolerance to enteral feeding or complications of enteral nutrition would imply adverse effects rather than lack of efficacy. The wording does not alter the intended concept."
1507005,Mycobacterium kansasii (organism),Record shows organism Mycobacterium kansasii,"The wording notes that a record lists the organism Mycobacterium kansasii, which is purely a species reference. In SNOMED CT, this is an Organism concept; SCTID 1507005 is the precise species code. The entry avoids introducing clinical attributes like infection or colonization, making disorder or finding codes inappropriate. The record context does not change the mapping from the organism identity."
1359924002,Entire joint of forefoot (body structure),Clinical site description: entire joint of forefoot,"This clinical description names the anatomical site as the entire forefoot joint, without attributes like severity, cause, or side. It is a Body structure concept, making SCTID 1359924002 the precise match. Parent concepts omitting the ‘entire’ qualifier are less exact, and children describing particular joints are too specific compared with the general whole-joint phrasing."
729339009,Entire descending superficial branch of cervical plexus (body structure),Chart notation: entire descending superficial branch of cervical plexus,"In a charting context, the entry denotes the anatomical structure as the entire descending superficial branch of the cervical plexus. The key attributes are implicit in the term: superficial position, descending course, and completeness of the branch. This is a Body structure concept. SCTID 729339009 is the exact match; parent concepts lack the completeness or specificity, sibling branches are different structures, and child concepts represent partial anatomy. No new clinical attributes are present, preserving the strict anatomical identity required."
464784003,Assisted reproduction catheter (physical object),Assisted reproduction catheter device entry,"This describes an entry concerning the device itself, namely a catheter used in assisted reproduction. It stays within Physical object and does not introduce properties or procedural specificity. Therefore, Assisted reproduction catheter (464784003) is the most precise code. Generic catheter objects are overly broad, and named ART subtypes would be too specific compared to the wording."
66440004,Human leukocyte antigen DRw8 (substance),HLA-DRw8 antigen label,"The text identifies the label/name of the antigen HLA-DRw8, without asserting any clinical attribute or action. The SNOMED CT category is Substance and maps precisely to 66440004 Human leukocyte antigen DRw8 (substance). Parent-level HLA-DR antigens are too general, and sibling antigens (other DRw numbers) would not fit. The use of 'label' does not transform the concept into a device or reagent; it remains a reference to the antigen substance."
285649006,Centrifugal force (physical force),Centrifugal force noted in chart,"This charting context still conveys the same Physical force concept. SCTID 285649006 matches specifically to 'centrifugal force'. The phrasing avoids causes, magnitudes, or clinical associations. Using broader or different force concepts would be less accurate given the explicit 'centrifugal' terminology."
426772002,Automobile accident (event),Car accident,"“Car accident” is a common clinical synonym for “Automobile accident,” with ‘car’ being colloquial for ‘automobile.’ The SNOMED CT category is Event. The wording does not add attributes such as traffic vs. nontraffic, collision mechanism, injury, or timing. Selecting a broader parent like “Accident (event)” would omit that the vehicle is an automobile, and choosing a sibling like “Motor vehicle accident” would be overly inclusive of other vehicle types. It also avoids narrower children (e.g., collision-specific) by using the generic ‘accident’ term, so SCTID 426772002 is the most precise match."
258528007,Rectal swab (specimen),Rectal swab specimen prepared,"This entry records a rectal swab specimen that has been prepared, making clear the specimen type while adding no clinical attributes that change the concept. The main idea is a swab specimen from the rectum; 'prepared' refers to processing status. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 258528007 is correct because it encodes a rectal swab (specimen) specifically. More general parents omit site detail, and siblings specifying different anorectal sites are not appropriate. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
277302009,Natures (qualifier value),Nature value set (qualifier value),"The entry points to the ‘Nature’ value set within SNOMED CT qualifier values, aligning with 277302009. Category: Qualifier value. By calling it a ‘value set,’ the phrase situates it as a group label without adding clinical specifics. It is not a child concept (e.g., particular nature subtype) nor a sibling like ‘Severities’; the parent ‘Qualifier value’ would be overly general. Therefore, the Natures grouper is the correct target."
441539007,Lofepramine hydrochloride (substance),Lofepramine (as hydrochloride),"This phrasing indicates the lofepramine substance specifically as its hydrochloride salt, without adding product or dosing details. SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 441539007 is the correct and specific code for the hydrochloride salt. The base substance concept for lofepramine or any product-level concept would be less precise, as the entry clearly denotes the salt form."
227196006,Mackerel canned in brine (substance),The item specified is mackerel canned in brine,"Despite the narrative style, the item named is exactly the substance: mackerel canned in brine. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. No additional qualifiers are implied that would change code selection; it simply repeats the preferred term content within a sentence. Parent concepts lacking brine or child/sibling concepts with different mediums are less appropriate. SCTID 227196006 is the best match."
440606009,Measurement of theophylline trough concentration (procedure),Theophylline trough concentration ordered,"This reflects an order for the procedure to measure the trough concentration of theophylline, which maps to the Procedure Measurement of theophylline trough concentration (440606009). The inclusion of ‘trough’ ensures specificity beyond parent concepts and differentiates it from sibling procedures such as peak concentration measurement."
767384004,Evacuated blood collection tube with clot activator (physical object),"Evacuated collection tube for blood, clot activator present","Main concept: an evacuated tube used for blood collection, with a clot activator present. Attributes: evacuated property, blood collection tube, clot activator additive. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This phrasing articulates the same attributes as SCTID 767384004 and thus is the most precise code. The parent concept is overly generic without the additive; tubes with gel separators or anticoagulants are different devices and not implied. The entry avoids adding details like color coding or specific activator type, preserving a unique mapping."
385437003,Institution (social concept),Institution category applied,"The central concept is ‘Institution’; ‘category applied’ indicates classification activity without changing the concept’s meaning. This maps to Institution (social concept) [SCTID: 385437003], within Social concept. Because no subtype or function is specified, children like hospital, school, or prison are excluded, and siblings like Organization or Facility are not implied. No residence or care context is introduced, so institutionalization-related findings are not applicable."
257783000,Thermocoagulation (qualifier value),Thermal coagulation,"The phrase denotes coagulation achieved by thermal means, which is clinically synonymous with thermocoagulation. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and Thermocoagulation (qualifier value) [257783000] is the best match because it captures heat-based coagulation as a method. The entry does not specify device (e.g., laser, RF) or site, avoiding more specific child/sibling concepts, and is more precise than parent-level generic coagulation qualifiers. The synonym does not change attributes or the intended qualifier."
242327003,Accidental ingestion of juneberries (event),Follow-up for accidental ingestion of juneberries,"The entry references a follow-up related to an event of accidental ingestion of juneberries. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The core event—accidental ingestion of juneberries—is unchanged by noting follow-up, so SCTID 242327003 remains the exact match. Parent concepts are less specific, and sibling codes for other substances or intentions would not fit. The entry does not introduce additional attributes like outcomes or severity."
85063003,Product containing opioid receptor partial agonist (product),Continue current opioid receptor partial agonist product,"This follow-up plan references continuation of a product defined by opioid receptor partial agonist activity. Category is Product. It avoids details like dose, route, or indication and does not specify an ingredient, matching the product-class concept SCTID 85063003. Broader parents ignore mechanism, and narrower children would require naming a specific agent. Sibling classes with different opioid receptor actions are not appropriate given the explicit partial agonist wording."
31115005,Structure of pleural mesothelium (body structure),Mesothelium of pleura,"This wording is a direct anatomical synonym that identifies the mesothelial lining belonging to the pleura. The concept expressed is the mesothelial layer of the pleura without any qualifiers. Category: Body structure. It maps most precisely to SNOMED CT 'Structure of pleural mesothelium' (31115005). Mapping to the parent 'Pleura' would be too broad, and specifying parietal or visceral would be a child concept not stated here. Sibling structures such as mesothelium of peritoneum are not applicable because the pleural location is explicit. The phrase is clinically equivalent to 'pleural mesothelium' and does not introduce new attributes."
258615006,Larva specimen (specimen),Parasitology: larva specimen,"Although labeled under parasitology context, the defined specimen is a larva. The Specimen category is appropriate, and the best match remains Larva specimen (258615006). The context does not assert parasitic species or host source, avoiding over-specification. Choosing a parent generic specimen would omit the larval detail, and child concepts adding species or parasitic status would be too specific."
414753003,Mode of transmission values (qualifier value),Select one mode of transmission value,"The instruction to select one value from the mode of transmission set points expressly to the value set concept, i.e., the Qualifier value 'Mode of transmission values'. It does not introduce or identify a particular mechanism or any clinical finding. Parent concepts are too broad, and child concepts (specific modes) are too specific, so SCTID 414753003 is appropriate. The phrasing does not add any extra attributes."
472955004,History of hearing loss (situation),Indication: history of hearing loss (for testing),"As an indication line for testing, this notes the patient has a historical hearing loss that motivates evaluation, without stating current deficit. SNOMED CT category: Situation. History of hearing loss (472955004) is the exact code because the concept is a past medical history item. Coding to Hearing loss (finding) would misrepresent the entry as present. No cause, severity, or laterality is introduced, keeping it distinct from sibling or child concepts."
43754007,Structure of anterior lip of cervix (body structure),Location referenced: anterior lip of cervix,"This entry specifies the anatomical location as the anterior lip of the cervix, with 'Location referenced' serving as neutral context. It belongs to the Body structure hierarchy and matches 'Structure of anterior lip of cervix' precisely. It does not generalize to the cervix as a whole nor shift to posterior or os structures."
258502009,Pus swab (specimen),Pus swab specimen,"The entry explicitly identifies the specimen type as a pus swab. The main concept is the specimen itself, fitting the SNOMED CT Specimen hierarchy, with the exact code 'Pus swab (specimen)' SCTID 258502009. Broader concepts like 'Swab specimen' or 'Pus specimen' lack the combined specificity of both pus as material and swab as collection device. No additional attributes (e.g., site or test) are present, so child or sibling concepts would be less accurate."
773976008,Dermatology care plan (record artifact),Dermatology care plan documented in EHR,"The entry identifies a dermatology care plan documented in the electronic health record, clearly pointing to a record artifact and matching Dermatology care plan (record artifact) [773976008]. The main concept is the plan of care; mentioning the EHR is a context for storage and does not change the concept. Category: Record artifact. It remains more specific than the generic parent care plan and does not introduce disease-specific or procedural attributes that would shift coding."
33331000087108,Specimen from abscess of vulva (specimen),Laboratory specimen: vulvar abscess,"This entry expresses a lab specimen with source identified as a vulvar abscess, aligning directly with “Specimen from abscess of vulva” (SCTID: 33331000087108). Category: Specimen. Mentioning “laboratory” reflects workflow context and not specimen type or additional attributes. More general parents (e.g., “Genital specimen”) omit the abscess site, while children/siblings that specify material (swab, aspirate, pus) would add details not present here. Therefore, the given concept is the best fit."
370811002,Evaluation of response to thermoregulation measures (procedure),Review of patient's response to thermoregulation measures,"This entry indicates a procedural review focused on how the patient responded to temperature-control interventions, matching 'Evaluation of response to thermoregulation measures (procedure)' (370811002). The main concept is an evaluative review of response; it does not report outcomes or specify a condition. Category: Procedure. 'Review' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'evaluation' in procedural documentation, preserving code selection. Broader parent codes for response evaluation to therapy would be less precise because this is explicitly about thermoregulation measures. Sibling concepts like 'Temperature monitoring' or 'Thermal therapy' do not correctly represent the evaluative nature."
119378002,Endocardial specimen (specimen),Endocardial sample,"The phrase denotes a sample taken from the endocardium; “sample” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “specimen” in SNOMED CT usage under the Specimen category. It targets the exact structure (endocardium) without specifying method or subtype, so “Endocardial specimen” is the most accurate code. Using broader cardiac specimen terms would lose specificity, while adding biopsy or valve details would inappropriately narrow the concept to a child."
276192381000087102,Gymnoascus reesii (organism),Organism: Gymnoascus reesii,"This entry explicitly labels the taxon as an organism and names it “Gymnoascus reesii,” pointing to the specific species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, with the best match Gymnoascus reesii (organism), SCTID 276192381000087102. The phrasing adds no extra attributes like infection or result status; it purely identifies the organism. More general parents (e.g., Gymnoascus genus or Fungus) are less accurate, and other species or findings-based concepts would not match the wording. The term remains a direct synonymic expression of the organism concept."
878834003,Staphylococcus schweitzeri (organism),Staph. schweitzeri,"“Staph.” is a common shorthand for the genus Staphylococcus in clinical and laboratory contexts, and pairing it with schweitzeri specifies the exact species. The concept expressed is solely the organism Staphylococcus schweitzeri, without any implication of detection, infection, or specimen source. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 878834003 is the specific species-level code. Using a parent concept like Staphylococcus (organism) would be too broad, and siblings (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) are different species. The shorthand is a clinically safe synonym that does not introduce new attributes, so the organism concept is the most accurate match."
822948005,Structure of articular cartilage of pelvic girdle (body structure),Anatomy: articular cartilage of the pelvic girdle,"The entry presents the same anatomical concept in a documentation context, still referring solely to the articular cartilage of the pelvic girdle. Category: Body structure. The match is SCTID 822948005. Contextual framing ('Anatomy:') does not alter the coded concept or introduce attributes. Parent or child variants would be either too broad or too specific relative to this exact regional articular cartilage."
272067002,Arabic numeral (qualifier value),Set numbering style to Arabic numerals,"The entry instructs that the numbering style be Arabic numerals, focusing only on the numeric representation. This is a Qualifier value and aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 272067002 ‘Arabic numeral (qualifier value)’. No additional attributes such as measurement, severity, or timing are included. Parent concepts for general numbering styles are too broad, and siblings like Roman numerals are not intended. The instruction is a paraphrase that remains semantically equivalent to the concept."
469688008,Ion-exchange-cartridge silver recovery system (physical object),Ion-exchange resin cartridge silver recovery device,"The entry describes a device that uses an ion-exchange resin in cartridge form to recover silver, matching the concept’s technical form and purpose. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The inclusion of “resin cartridge” clarifies the mechanism without changing the meaning. It is more specific than a generic silver recovery device and distinct from electrolytic systems, making the given concept the most precise match."
312494007,Vaginal vault smear specimen (specimen),Label reads “vaginal vault smear specimen”,A labeling context still identifies the specimen type (smear) and source (vaginal vault). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It matches Vaginal vault smear specimen (SCTID 312494007). Parents lacking site and siblings denoting other sites or collection methods would be less accurate. The label context does not introduce timing or test method attributes and remains a direct representation of the concept.
736403006,Hyperemesis in pregnancy inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient care plan addressing hyperemesis in pregnancy,"The wording clearly identifies a care plan artifact in the inpatient setting and specifies it addresses hyperemesis in pregnancy. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It is the most precise match to SCTID 736403006 because it focuses on the inpatient plan-of-care tied to this condition, not the disorder or a procedure. Parent concepts like generic inpatient care plans are broader, and sibling artifacts such as outpatient plans or care pathways would be inappropriate. “Addressing” does not introduce new attributes; it restates the focus of the plan."
715508000,Assessment using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 item scale declined (situation),GAD-7 completion declined.,"This denotes the patient declined completing the GAD-7, and introduces no other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 715508000 is exact for situations where the GAD-7 assessment is declined. Parent concepts like “Questionnaire not completed” without specifying decline or the instrument are too general, and codes for completed assessments would be wrong. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to refusal of the GAD-7 assessment."
16211731000119101,Specimen from breast with lymph node obtained by modified radical mastectomy (specimen),"Specimen type: breast with lymph node, collected during modified radical mastectomy","The entry identifies the specimen type as breast tissue together with a lymph node and states collection during modified radical mastectomy. The main concept is a specimen with defined composition and procedural source. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This precisely matches “Specimen from breast with lymph node obtained by modified radical mastectomy (specimen).” More generic parents or siblings missing either the lymph node or the modified radical procedure component would be less appropriate. The phrasing uses neutral synonyms like “collected,” which do not introduce additional attributes."
277733009,Level 1 (qualifier value),Level 1,"The entry explicitly states the ordinal qualifier 'Level 1' without any additional clinical attributes or context. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the most precise code is Level 1 (qualifier value) [277733009]. Using a broader parent such as 'Level (qualifier value)' or 'Ordinal value' would be nonspecific, and siblings like 'Level 0' or 'Level 2' would not match the stated level. No other qualifier (e.g., grade, stage, severity) is implied, so 277733009 is the correct selection."
736399002,Burn inpatient care plan (record artifact),Burn inpatient care plan,"The entry explicitly denotes a care plan specific to burns and confined to the inpatient setting. The main concept is a documented plan of care, with attributes indicating the condition (burn) and the setting (inpatient). This fits the SNOMED CT category Record artifact and matches SCTID 736399002 Burn inpatient care plan (record artifact) exactly. More general parents like Care plan (record artifact) or Inpatient care plan (record artifact) lack the burn specificity, while siblings such as Burn care plan without the inpatient qualifier or Burn outpatient care plan would not capture the hospital setting. The wording is the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
251895002,Leg fatigue rating (staging scale),Patient statement: “leg fatigue rating (staging scale)” appears on my form.,"A patient-reported context still references the scale by name without implying administration or a score. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale. The entry avoids adding attributes like severity or laterality and does not convert the concept into a procedure. It is specific to leg fatigue, making it a precise match rather than a generic parent or an alternate-region sibling."
287746005,Spermatic cord explored (situation),Theater log entry: spermatic cord exploration undertaken.,"The statement reflects that the exploration of the spermatic cord was undertaken, without adding attributes such as laterality, indication, or method. This is a Situation with explicit context and corresponds to “Spermatic cord explored (situation).” ‘Undertaken’ is synonymous with performed/completed, preserving code selection. General parent situations or procedure-only codes are less precise, and siblings involving other structures or non-performed contexts are not applicable."
472939006,Tracheostomy tube submitted as specimen (specimen),Specimen identification: tracheostomy tube,"The phrase identifies the specimen as a tracheostomy tube, directly mapping to the specific SNOMED CT specimen concept for tracheostomy tube submission. The main concept is the specimen. The category is Specimen. Identification wording does not imply additional attributes or a different device type. Coding to a generic parent would be inadequate, and siblings such as “Endotracheal tube specimen” are not correct. It is a clinically equivalent expression of the preferred term."
399360002,Verticosubmental projection (qualifier value),Positioning performed for verticosubmental projection,"The entry describes patient positioning for a named projection technique and specifies it as verticosubmental. It avoids adding anatomy or modality details. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This is best coded to Verticosubmental projection (399360002). A parent projection concept would be vague, and the sibling submentovertex projection does not match the stated verticosubmental orientation."
184234001,Family record folder (record artifact),Nursing documentation: family record folder,"This entry records in nursing documentation that the artifact is a family record folder, which matches 'Family record folder' (SCTID: 184234001). Category: Record artifact. The documentation context is not an attribute that changes the artifact type or scope. Choosing a general record artifact or a patient-specific folder would be less appropriate. The terminology is semantically equivalent and specific to the family folder."
26626008,Latency of speech response (observable entity),Latency of verbal reply,"The focus is the latency of a verbal reply, an observable measurement of response timing. The suitable SNOMED CT concept is Latency of speech response (26626008), Observable entity. 'Verbal' in this context equivalently denotes spoken speech; no additional attributes are introduced. It is more specific than generic latency and does not reflect a diagnostic finding such as delayed speech response."
767696004,Remote control insulin infusion patch pump blood glucose analyzer (physical object),Controller for insulin patch pump with on-board blood glucose analyzer,"This phrasing describes the controller for an insulin patch pump that has an on-board blood glucose analyzer, indicating a single integrated physical device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. “Controller” equates to remote control, and “on-board blood glucose analyzer” preserves the intended feature set. Parent devices (controller without analyzer) or standalone analyzers (sibling) are less appropriate, affirming SCTID 767696004."
297712007,Ga language (qualifier value),Preferred language: Ga,"This sets the preferred language to Ga, which still expresses only the language value without adding extra clinical attributes. The correct SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and Ga language (qualifier value) [297712007] is the precise code. A parent concept (any language) would be overly broad, and other specific languages would miscode the data. The preference context does not change the language identity being captured."
164814002,Postcoital test (procedure),Post-coital test,"This entry is a hyphenation variant of the preferred term, still denoting the same procedure conducted after sexual intercourse to examine sperm–cervical mucus interaction, mapping directly to Postcoital test (procedure), SCTID 164814002. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The hyphen does not change clinical meaning; it remains a semantically equivalent synonym. Parent concepts (e.g., diagnostic procedure) are too general, and sibling or child procedures like semen analysis or non-postcoital cervical mucus tests lack the defining postcoital attribute. Thus, this is the most precise match to the specified concept."
736340002,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome inpatient care plan (record artifact),Hospital inpatient care plan for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,"This entry denotes a hospital-based inpatient care plan crafted for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The focus is the care plan artifact tied to the inpatient setting, not the clinical condition itself. Category: Record artifact. The best code is SCTID 736340002, which captures OHSS inpatient care plan. Parent concepts like generic inpatient care plan or OHSS care plan without specifying inpatient are less precise, and siblings like outpatient care plan or protocols would not match the wording. The inclusion of “hospital inpatient” reinforces the inpatient context without changing the artifact type."
414415007,History of chronic lung disease (situation),PMH includes chronic lung disease,"PMH includes chronic lung disease denotes that the patient’s past medical history contains the diagnosis, specifying a historical situation rather than an active condition. As a Situation with explicit context, SNOMED CT 414415007 History of chronic lung disease is the most accurate code. Broader history categories or specific disease subtypes are not indicated, and this does not map to the disorder Chronic lung disease because the focus is on past history rather than present state."
718165006,Checklist of Communication Competencies score (observable entity),Communication Competencies Checklist (CCC) score,"By placing CCC in parentheses after the full instrument name, the entry clearly denotes the instrument-specific score as an observable. This aligns with “Checklist of Communication Competencies score” (SCTID 718165006). The entry avoids values and interpretations, preserving the pure measurement parameter. Broader or different-instrument score concepts would be less precise matches, and any procedural reference would misclassify the entity. The phrasing is a synonymous restatement of the same concept."
251743004,Near visual acuity (observable entity),Near visual acuity observation,"The phrase identifies near visual acuity as the observation (i.e., the property observed), without providing values, laterality, or correction. Category: Observable entity. Near visual acuity (251743004) is the correct code. Parent Visual acuity is overly broad, and procedural concepts like 'observation of near visual acuity' would be less precise because this wording denotes the attribute, not the act. The term 'observation' here points to the observable entity rather than a procedure."
5481000179108,Home visit medical report (record artifact),At-home visit medical report,"The wording denotes a medical report produced for an at-home visit, clearly indicating a record artifact tied to the home setting. The most specific SNOMED CT concept is Home visit medical report (record artifact), SCTID 5481000179108. Using Medical report alone would be overly general, and mapping to Home visit (procedure) would be incorrect because the entry references documentation rather than the encounter. No extra attributes beyond the report context are introduced."
699790001,Failed endoscopy of urinary bladder (situation),Attempted cystoscopy—unsuccessful,"The entry describes an attempted cystoscopy that was unsuccessful, i.e., failed endoscopy of the urinary bladder, without adding cause or timing details. It is a Situation concerning procedural outcome. The best match is SCTID 699790001. More general failure codes or related siblings implying abandonment or cancellation are less precise given the wording."
758658000,Structure of lateral condyle of left tibia (body structure),Anatomic site: lateral condyle of left tibia,"The phrase labels an anatomical site and identifies it as the lateral condyle of the left tibia, with attributes of bone, substructure, and left laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This is a context-labeled synonym for “Structure of lateral condyle of left tibia” without adding clinical findings or procedural details. Parent concepts lacking laterality are less specific, and sibling structures like the medial condyle or plateau refer to different anatomy, so the precise code applies."
299184000,Active range of thumb opposition (observable entity),Diagnostic report heading: active range of thumb opposition,"Presented as a report heading, this still designates the observable entity measuring active ROM for the thumb’s opposition movement. It does not include measurements, laterality, or severity. In SNOMED CT terms, this is an Observable entity, and SCTID 299184000 is the precise code. Broader or different-motion concepts (e.g., passive opposition ROM or general thumb AROM) are less accurate for this specific heading."
216428000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, orphanage (environment)",Event took place at the orphanage (accident/poisoning),"The concept expressed is that the accident/poisoning event’s place-of-occurrence was an orphanage, with no additional clinical details. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This is best coded with 216428000 because it specifies orphanage as the external cause location. Using a general place-of-occurrence code would be less precise, and sibling locations (school, daycare, home) would be incorrect. The phrase “event took place” is a neutral synonym that preserves the intended meaning without adding attributes."
6171000146105,Veillonella magna (organism),Microbiology organism: Veillonella magna,"The text identifies Veillonella magna as an organism in a microbiology context, which still centers on the organism’s identity rather than a clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the precise code is Veillonella magna (SCTID: 6171000146105). The context label 'microbiology' does not add attributes like infection, site, or severity. A genus-level parent or broader bacterial category would be too general, and sibling species do not match the specified name."
301177009,Delayed venous return in limb vein (finding),Follow-up note: delayed venous return in limb vein,"The entry situates the finding in a follow-up context but clearly states the clinical finding: delayed venous return in a limb vein. The core concept is unchanged and is categorized as a Clinical finding. The note avoids additional attributes such as duration, severity, laterality, etiology, or limb segment, so it fits SCTID 301177009. Parent concepts are less precise due to missing location, and child/sibling concepts specifying limb type would over-specify beyond the wording."
278032008,Preventive service (qualifier value),Preventive service,"The entry states the concept directly as “preventive service,” which denotes the intent classification of a health care service. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value and matches SCTID 278032008. It does not specify a particular procedure, screening, exam, or therapeutic action, so child or sibling concepts such as specific preventive procedures, screenings, or wellness examinations would be less appropriate. The wording contains no added attributes (e.g., cause, severity, timing, laterality) and is a precise label for the preventive service qualifier."
214438007,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving fall down stairs of motor bus while boarding or alighting, passenger of motor vehicle injured (event)",Prior event: noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident with passenger injured after falling down motor bus steps while boarding.,"This follow-up note indicates a past noncollision MV traffic accident, passenger injury, fall down motor bus steps, and boarding. The concept is an Event, and 214438007 is the most accurate mapping. Parent concepts are generic; collision-based or nontraffic siblings are excluded. “Steps” is synonymous with “stairs,” and the temporal phrasing (“prior event”) does not alter the event’s encoded attributes."
30623001,Catch (finding),Catch observed,"This indicates a clinician-observed catch without specifying a site, cause, or severity, preserving the core concept of a catch as a finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, and Catch (finding) [30623001] is the exact match. It is not a better fit for broader parent categories nor for siblings like 'crepitus' or 'snapping'. 'Observed' expresses context of examination and does not introduce a different attribute that would change the code."
277826004,Anxiety about sweating (finding),Noted anxiety about perspiration,"This note uses 'perspiration' synonymously with 'sweating' and indicates anxiety focused on it. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 277826004 is the exact match as it codifies anxiety about sweating. Parent 'Anxiety' lacks the specific subject, and codes for sweating abnormalities are not applicable. The synonym does not change the clinical meaning or add attributes such as cause or severity."
214149008,Motor vehicle on road in collision with ridden animal (event),Follow-up: motor vehicle on road collision with ridden animal,"In follow-up documentation, this entry repeats the event mechanism of a motor vehicle collision on a road with a ridden animal, without adding timing or outcomes. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 214149008 is the precise match due to the explicit inclusion of motor vehicle, on road, collision, and ridden animal. Broader parents and siblings describing other animal statuses or locations don’t fit. The contextual label ‘Follow-up’ does not alter the event content or mapping."
12086009,Hemoglobin G-Hsi-Tsou (substance),Panel listing includes Hemoglobin G-Hsi-Tsou,"The phrase indicates that the named substance is a component of a panel list, without adding attributes of presence, abnormality, or patient traits. The concept is Hemoglobin G-Hsi-Tsou (Substance). SCTID 12086009 is the specific match; parent concepts lack the variant specificity, and other hemoglobin G siblings are different named entities."
762996008,Malignant neoplasm of vulva suspected (situation),Query vulvar malignancy.,"The term 'query' in clinical documentation denotes suspicion or consideration of a diagnosis, here a vulvar malignancy. This is a Situation with explicit context and matches the suspected status. 'Malignancy' is synonymous with malignant neoplasm; the site is precisely vulva, aligning with SCTID 762996008. Parent confirmed vulvar cancer and broader suspected malignancy without site are less appropriate given the specific suspicion and location."
442841003,Subgenus Microlagus (organism),History list entry: Subgenus Microlagus,"This entry records Subgenus Microlagus in a history list context, but the substantive concept is the organism taxon at subgenus rank. It maps to the SNOMED CT Organism category with SCTID 442841003. Broader organism parent concepts or alternative ranks are unsuitable, as ‘subgenus’ is specified. The context phrase ‘History list entry’ does not add clinical attributes; it preserves the core concept without altering code selection."
65181000119105,History of implantation of posterior chamber intraocular lens (situation),Prior PCIOL implant documented.,"The entry notes a prior (historical) PCIOL implant, with PCIOL indicating posterior chamber intraocular lens and “documented” emphasizing recorded history. The main concept is a historical situation of PCIOL implantation. SNOMED CT category: Situation; best code: 65181000119105. A parent concept without explicit posterior chamber detail is less accurate. Sibling concepts (anterior chamber IOL history, general presence of IOL) are excluded because the statement is specifically posterior chamber and refers to a past implant event. “Implant” is equivalent to an implantation procedure in this context."
166443001,Serum progesterone level within reference range (finding),Serum progesterone outcome: normal,"This entry communicates the outcome of a serum progesterone test as 'normal,' which is equivalent to within the reference range, categorizing it as a Clinical finding. The appropriate SNOMED CT code is 166443001, representing serum progesterone within reference range. Parent concepts lacking the normal qualifier and sibling abnormal result concepts are less suitable. 'Outcome: normal' is a typical synonym and does not introduce time, severity, or other attributes."
371531000,Report of clinical encounter (record artifact),Report of clinical encounter,"The entry explicitly names a report that documents a clinical encounter, which matches the SNOMED CT concept 'Report of clinical encounter (record artifact)' SCTID 371531000. The main concept is a report; no additional attributes such as setting, specialty, or timing are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is more precise than broader parent concepts like 'Report (record artifact)' and does not drift into child or sibling concepts such as 'Discharge summary', 'Operative report', 'Consultation report', or 'Clinical note', none of which are specified in the wording. Because the phrase is the exact preferred term, it unambiguously maps to 371531000."
441950002,Histopathology department (environment),Department for histopathology,"This reverse phrasing maintains that the concept is a department whose scope is histopathology, still an environmental location. Main concept: histopathology department environment. Attributes: none. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It unambiguously maps to 441950002 rather than to service-level or laboratory-level siblings. The preposition 'for' does not introduce a different concept; it is semantically equivalent to 'Department of histopathology.'"
411612000,Swine urine proteins diagnostic allergen extract (product),Swine urine protein-based allergen extract (diagnostic use),The entry identifies an allergen extract based on swine urine proteins and clarifies diagnostic use. This is a Product. SCTID 411612000 is the exact match given the source and diagnostic purpose. Broader allergen extracts or therapeutic preparations would be less specific. Sibling concepts involving swine allergens from different materials are excluded by the explicit urine protein basis. The wording remains within the scope of the FSN without adding other attributes.
301181009,Cardiovascular system problem (finding),Unspecified problem of the cardiovascular system,"The wording conveys a general, non-specific problem affecting the cardiovascular system, with no additional qualifiers. This maps most precisely to SNOMED CT 'Cardiovascular system problem' (301181009), categorized as a Clinical finding. More general parents lack the system focus, while any specific disorder or heart-only/vascular-only problem would be too narrow. 'Unspecified' simply acknowledges lack of further detail and does not change the concept."
45784001,Xanthine oxidase (substance),Enzyme named xanthine oxidase,"The phrase identifies the enzyme by name, with no added qualifiers implying function beyond being the named substance. Main concept: xanthine oxidase. Attributes: none. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The best match is 45784001 |Xanthine oxidase (substance)|. Parent concepts like Enzyme are too generic, and children/siblings like xanthine dehydrogenase or enzyme activity concepts are not expressed."
787578006,Neurosurgical cartilage manipulator (physical object),Supply request: neurosurgical cartilage manipulator,"This entry denotes a request for the device but still centers on the physical object—the neurosurgical cartilage manipulator—without adding device-specific attributes. It aligns with SNOMED CT SCTID 787578006 (Physical object). Mapping to a supply request concept would misrepresent the core object. Parent concepts like “Neurosurgical instrument” are overly broad, and generic cartilage manipulators lack specialty specificity. Sibling instruments (e.g., probes, elevators) have different functions, making them less appropriate."
709275003,Family education about monitoring respiratory status (situation),Documented family teaching about monitoring respiratory status.,"The entry documents that teaching (education) was provided to the family regarding monitoring respiratory status. This is directly aligned with 'Family education about monitoring respiratory status (situation)' SCTID 709275003 within Situation with explicit context. Broader alternatives would omit the family or monitoring focus, and child concepts with specific methods or conditions are not mentioned. 'Teaching' is a synonym of education, and no extra attributes are added, maintaining precise coding."
259059007,Kilocalorie/hour (qualifier value),Energy expenditure units: kilocalorie/hour,"The entry designates the unit used to express energy expenditure as kilocalorie per hour, a qualifier value. It does not provide a measurement or add attributes beyond the unit itself. This aligns directly with SCTID 259059007. Parent concepts like unit-of-rate would be too generic, and siblings such as kilojoule/hour would reflect a different unit. The phrase is contextual but the coded concept is solely the specified unit, maintaining precision."
771385008,Suspected victim of bullying (situation),Possible victim of bullying,"This phrase denotes possibility and uncertainty about the patient being a victim of bullying, which is equivalent to a suspected status. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context because the clinical state described is suspicion rather than a definitive finding. It aligns with SCTID 771385008 as it specifies bullying and victim status with an uncertain, possible characterization. A confirmed 'victim of bullying' finding would be inappropriate since certainty is not stated. Broader abuse or non-specific victimization terms would be less precise than the bullying-specific suspicion captured here."
1156569003,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of vagina at deep surgical margin in vaginectomy specimen (observable entity),Patient reports pathology found primary vaginal cancer at the deep margin of the vaginectomy specimen.,"The patient-reported statement restates presence of primary vaginal cancer at the deep margin in a vaginectomy specimen. The main elements remain presence, deep margin, specimen, and primary vaginal malignant neoplasm. It is an Observable entity, and SCTID 1156569003 is the most precise match. Using a parent concept like unspecified margin positivity would be less specific, and siblings covering other margins would be incorrect. 'Primary vaginal cancer' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'primary malignant neoplasm of vagina' and maintains the same code."
1255757001,Sarcomatoid histologic pattern (qualifier value),Histopathology pattern recorded as sarcomatoid,"The wording denotes a histopathology attribute-value pair, with the pattern recorded as sarcomatoid. This maps to the Qualifier value Sarcomatoid histologic pattern [SCTID: 1255757001]. A generic parent would be insufficient, and sibling patterns are not what the text conveys. The documentation does not add attributes like site, diagnosis, timing, or severity, hence morphologic abnormality or disorder codes are not appropriate. The synonym ""histopathology pattern"" is equivalent to ""histologic pattern"" for coding purposes and preserves the intended qualifier meaning."
1184588000,Functional status document section (record artifact),Functional Status section of the medical record,"This entry identifies the functional status section within the medical record, precisely mapping to 'Functional status document section (record artifact)' SCTID 1184588000. The main concept is a section artifact; 'medical record' gives context without adding clinical attributes. The category is Record artifact. It is the most appropriate code because the phrase describes the section container rather than any functional finding or an assessment procedure. Selecting a parent 'Document section' would be too broad, and sibling sections (e.g., 'Vital signs section') do not match the functional focus. The phrasing is an equivalent synonym for the preferred concept."
313310007,Vocal cords stripped (situation),Laryngoscopy confirms vocal cords stripped,"This diagnostic context confirms the status that the cords are stripped, consistent with the situation concept capturing that the vocal cords have been stripped. The category is Situation with explicit context because the statement records the resulting status rather than describing a procedure being performed. It avoids adding attributes such as technique or etiology and is more precise than a generic laryngeal finding or procedure code. The confirmation language does not shift the meaning away from the situation of stripped cords."
1304286000,Diepoxybutane induced chromosome breakage technique (qualifier value),Diepoxybutane-induced chromosomal breakage method,"This entry uses 'method' as a synonym for 'technique' and specifies diepoxybutane as the inducing agent for chromosomal breakage. It represents a Qualifier value for the technique and does not introduce attributes such as test type, specimen, or clinical indication. The explicit agent avoids mapping to the parent 'chromosome breakage technique' and distinguishes it from siblings like mitomycin C-induced methods. Therefore, SCTID 1304286000 is the correct, most specific code."
433801000124107,Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab (specimen),Combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab specimen,"The slash format indicates a combined specimen that includes both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing, representing one specimen. This is a Specimen concept. The exact match is SCTID 433801000124107. Parent-level concepts lack specificity for sites, and separate NP or OP swabs would be under-inclusive. The slash is a stylistic synonym that maintains equivalence to the full phrasing."
224848004,Nursery school (environment),Location: nursery school,"This phrasing uses a documentation label ('Location') to denote the environmental place as nursery school. The main concept is the environment; no events, roles, or timing are asserted. It belongs to the Environment category and maps to SCTID 224848004. It is not a broader school environment nor a different facility type, so parent, child, or sibling concepts would be less precise. The label 'Location' is a neutral contextual tag and does not change code selection."
411846001,Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Patient statement: dust mite test used Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus diagnostic extract,"In a patient-reported context, the product is still clearly identified as a diagnostic extract of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, with no added attributes like dose or result. This remains a Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product) in SNOMED CT, mapping to SCTID 411846001. It does not imply a procedure concept or therapeutic use, and it excludes parent concepts without species as well as sibling species or mixture extracts, ensuring precise alignment with the species-specific diagnostic product."
69135000,Free-standing infectious disease clinic (environment),Standalone infectious diseases clinic,"This entry describes the environment of care: a clinic focused on infectious diseases that is standalone. The term standalone is a clinically common synonym for free-standing, preserving the same meaning. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, and the best fit is Free-standing infectious disease clinic (environment), SCTID 69135000. A more general parent (infectious disease clinic) would lose the free-standing qualifier, while any child or sibling specifying hospital integration or outpatient status would add constraints not present in this phrase. No additional attributes are introduced."
704911005,"Cotton burn dressing, non-sterile (physical object)",Not sterile cotton burn dressing,"“Not sterile” is a clear paraphrase of non-sterile and keeps the essential attributes: dressing for burns and cotton material. Category: Physical object. The phrasing does not add extraneous details and avoids mapping to a procedure or a finding. It is more specific than parents that omit sterility or material, and it avoids sterile or different-material siblings, making the concept “Cotton burn dressing, non-sterile” (704911005) the most precise match."
20599005,Aedes seoulensis (organism),Aedes seoulensis classification,"The phrase refers to the classification of Aedes seoulensis, keeping the focus on the organism’s taxonomic identity and not adding attributes about condition or exposure. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It maps to 'Aedes seoulensis (organism)' (20599005) because the species is specified. Parent concepts (genus-level) would be overly broad, and sibling taxa would misrepresent the species. 'Classification' is a neutral synonym indicating taxonomic identification."
429084005,History of malignant neoplasm of rectum (situation),Past history: rectal carcinoma.,"The entry explicitly marks rectal carcinoma as past history, i.e., a previous rectal malignancy. The category is Situation with explicit context (history). SNOMED CT 429084005 is the correct selection because it encodes past history of malignant neoplasm of rectum. Using a disorder code would imply active disease. Concepts for broader GI sites or colon would not match the rectal specificity. “Carcinoma” here is a synonym for malignant neoplasm and does not alter the coding."
182719007,Antigen-free surroundings (environment),Antigen-absent environment,"The entry uses 'antigen-absent' to indicate complete absence of antigens in the environment; this is a synonymous construction to antigen-free. The main concept is environment with antigens absent, with no other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This corresponds exactly to Antigen-free surroundings (environment) SCTID 182719007. Parent concepts do not capture antigen status, and sibling concepts like sterile or aseptic environments are not equivalent because they imply microbial control rather than antigen absence."
705984000,Multichannel electrocardiograph (physical object),Multichannel electrocardiograph device,"The entry explicitly names a device that is an electrocardiograph with multichannel capability. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). It maps to 705984000 since it is more specific than the general electrocardiograph and does not introduce details that would push it into child concepts (like 12-lead) or sibling devices (monitors, Holter). The synonym “device” simply denotes the physical object and does not affect code selection."
16206004,Oxygen delivery (observable entity),Observable: oxygen delivery to tissues,"This entry explicitly labels oxygen delivery as an observable, specifying tissues to denote the systemic DO2 scope without regionalization or abnormality. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and the best match is SCTID 16206004. It avoids conflation with therapy or measurement procedures and is distinct from siblings like saturation or consumption. The phrasing remains a clinically equivalent description of DO2."
76385003,Product containing alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist (product),Radiology intake medication—alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist,"This entry reflects a radiology intake medication listed as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist product. In SNOMED CT, this is a Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The explicit alpha-1 targeting maps most precisely to SCTID 76385003. Parent classes that generalize adrenergic antagonism or alpha subtypes are less specific, and sibling classes for other receptor subtypes are incorrect. There are no details of ingredient, dose, or route, avoiding child concepts. The intake context does not introduce attributes that change the product-class coding."
313093000,Ultraviolet C radiation (physical force),UV-C radiation,"UV-C radiation is a standard abbreviation and synonymous phrasing for Ultraviolet C radiation, referring to the same electromagnetic radiation band without adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 313093000 is the correct code; using a parent like Ultraviolet radiation would be less specific, and siblings UVA/UVB radiation would be incorrect. The abbreviation does not change the concept; it is a clinically equivalent synonym."
257612006,Farm land (environment),Within farmland,"“Within farmland” conveys being in the environment of farmland, i.e., land used for agricultural purposes, which matches Farm land (environment), SCTID 257612006 in the Environment or geographical location category. It does not introduce attributes such as the type of agriculture or building-related elements, avoiding mappings to Farm (environment) or to specific subtypes like Cropland. The farmland environment concept is the exact, most specific fit."
224658003,Semi-detached bungalow (environment),Patient reports home is a semi-detached bungalow,"The statement conveys the dwelling type: a bungalow (single-storey) that is semi-detached, which is an environmental descriptor. This directly matches SNOMED CT 'Semi-detached bungalow (environment)' SCTID 224658003. Parents or siblings ('Bungalow (environment)', 'Semi-detached house (environment)') are less accurate because they omit either semi-detached or single-storey, respectively. The patient-reported context does not affect the coding; 224658003 is the precise code."
51797001,Ultrasonic wave (physical force),Physical force identified: ultrasonic wave,"The entry explicitly identifies the physical force as an ultrasonic wave, which is a precise description of the agent. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. This corresponds to SCTID 51797001, not to procedure or event concepts. General parents (sound wave) and alternative siblings (audible/infrasonic) are less appropriate because the ultrasonic property is specified. The phrase “identified” is contextual and does not change the core concept."
223716001,Chile (geographic location),Chile — sovereign state,"Describing Chile as a 'sovereign state' is a synonymic classification of the country and remains a geographic location concept. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223716001 precisely matches the country; sibling or child concepts (e.g., subdivisions) are not implied. No extra clinical attributes are introduced."
216289007,"Accident involving collision between powered vehicle, used solely within the buildings and premises of an industrial or commercial establishment, and pedestrian (event)",Factory incident report: powered vehicle collided with pedestrian,"This narrative states a powered vehicle collided with a pedestrian within a factory, which matches SNOMED CT Event SCTID: 216289007. It includes the necessary elements—powered vehicle restricted to industrial premises and pedestrian involvement—without adding detail like specific vehicle types or injuries. The generic vehicle‑pedestrian collision parent lacks premises restriction, and child concepts for named vehicle classes are not indicated. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
17497007,Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase (substance),Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase—cytochrome oxidase from Pseudomonas,"This entry repeats the concept for clarity: cytochrome oxidase originating from Pseudomonas, which aligns exactly with SNOMED CT Substance concept 17497007. It is more specific than the parent cytochrome oxidase and does not imply species-level children. The wording explicitly avoids suggesting test reagents or clinical findings, ensuring the mapping targets the substance itself."
217156008,Fall on same level from tripping (event),Reported: fall on same level from tripping,"This reported event concisely captures a same-level fall due to tripping, without extra details like timing, injury, or setting. The category is Event. The most precise SNOMED CT code is Fall on same level from tripping (event), SCTID 217156008. Parent concepts are too general without the mechanism, and sibling concepts with other causes would be inaccurate. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase and remains semantically equivalent."
397456005,Specimen from thoracic mesothelium obtained by thoracoscopic biopsy (specimen),Thoracic mesothelial tissue biopsy specimen (thoracoscopic),"This states that the specimen is thoracic mesothelial tissue obtained by a thoracoscopic biopsy, aligning exactly with the concept. The main concept is a specimen; attributes include site (thoracic mesothelium/pleura) and method (thoracoscopic biopsy). It falls under the Specimen category and maps to SCTID 397456005. It does not add laterality or condition context. Parent concepts that lack method specificity or siblings implying non-thoracoscopic techniques would be less appropriate for this explicit wording."
416779005,Anesthesia record (record artifact),Anesthesia record requested by patient,"The entry references a patient’s request for their anesthesia record, identifying the documentation artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This maps most precisely to “Anesthesia record,” SCTID 416779005. More general records are insufficiently specific, and siblings such as anesthesia report or note would incorrectly add a document-style attribute not present in the phrase."
608840004,Specimen from lower gastrointestinal tract (specimen),Specimen of lower gastrointestinal tract,"This entry indicates a specimen related to the lower gastrointestinal tract as its origin, without additional details about type or subsite. It maps to SNOMED CT 608840004 in the Specimen hierarchy. Choosing a parent for GI tract overall would be too general, and child concepts for specific structures (colon, rectum) or types (biopsy, stool) would be too specific. The slightly different phrasing remains a clinically equivalent expression of source."
735204006,Born in Serbia (finding),Demographics: born in Serbia,"Within a demographic context, the statement 'born in Serbia' still conveys the same Clinical finding: birthplace is Serbia, mapping to 'Born in Serbia (finding)' SCTID 735204006. The context label does not add attributes that would alter coding. Parent concepts like 'Born in country' are overly broad, and siblings for other countries are not applicable. No city or subnational detail is included, so this country-level Serbia concept remains the most precise."
121994002,Dinoflagellate identification (procedure),Dinoflagellate ID,"The term 'ID' is a standard abbreviation for identification in laboratory contexts and does not add attributes such as specimen, method, or status. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It is clinically equivalent to 'Dinoflagellate identification' and aligns with SCTID 121994002. Parent concepts are less specific, and sibling concepts involving other organisms are not intended. It does not imply detection or typing beyond identification, avoiding child method-specific codes."
423872002,Genus Brotogeris (organism),"Brotogeris spp., genus reference","The combination of 'spp.' and 'genus reference' indicates multiple unspecified species within the genus Brotogeris, effectively coding to the genus level. The main concept is the organism genus Brotogeris in the Organism category. The most precise SNOMED CT code is Genus Brotogeris (organism) SCTID 423872002. Parent taxa are too general, and specific species (children) are not named. The 'spp.' synonym is standard taxonomic shorthand and does not alter the code selection."
773980003,Orthotic care plan (record artifact),Orthotic care plan in place,"Saying a care plan is 'in place' denotes the existence of a documented orthotic plan-of-care without adding execution or timing details that would alter coding. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It aligns with Orthotic care plan (record artifact) 773980003 because it references the artifact rather than any procedure or device. More generic care plan codes are less specific, and sibling concepts (e.g., prosthetic care plan) would not fit the orthotic context."
170996007,Counseled by social worker (situation),Counseling delivered by social worker.,"The statement captures that counseling was delivered and identifies the provider as a social worker, with no added attributes. This corresponds to SNOMED CT 170996007, Counseled by social worker (situation), a Situation concept. 'Delivered' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'provided' and maintains equivalence to counseling by a social worker. General parent concepts without the social worker role are less specific, and sibling concepts implying different interactions (e.g., seen or assessed) do not match. Thus, this is uniquely codable to the given concept."
277457005,Histological grading systems (staging scale),Histological grading framework,"This phrase denotes a framework for grading histological features, aligning with a staging scale concept. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale (assessment scale), and the precise code is 277457005 (Histological grading systems). It does not mention a specific named scale or any grade outcome, so child concepts are excluded. It is not a clinical finding or an observable result; it refers to the system itself. The term 'framework' is a valid synonym for 'system' or 'scale' without changing the concept."
46224007,Vaccination clinic (environment),Evaluated in the vaccination clinic,"The statement communicates that evaluation occurred within a vaccination clinic setting, focusing on location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. Vaccination clinic (environment) [46224007] exactly matches this environment. Choosing a parent concept such as Health care facility (environment) would be overly general, and procedure codes are not applicable because only the site is specified. No additional attributes (e.g., vaccine species, urgency, or timing) are added."
285651005,Magnetic field (physical force),Magnetic field recorded,"This entry records the magnetic field without introducing properties or contextual attributes. The central concept is magnetic field (Physical force), aligning to SCTID 285651005. Broader parents are too general, and siblings like 'Electromagnetic field' or 'Electric field' are different phenomena. No detail is present to justify a more specific child code, so the general magnetic field concept is correct."
165528007,Basophil count outside reference range (finding),Basophil count abnormal on CBC,"This entry indicates the basophil count component of a CBC is abnormal, which equates to being outside the reference range. It is a Clinical finding. The wording does not specify increased or decreased values, ruling out child concepts. Mentioning 'CBC' is contextual (where the finding was obtained) and does not broaden the concept to a general CBC abnormality; the focus remains the basophil count."
404187006,Statement of needs (record artifact),Clinical needs statement,"This entry is a paraphrase of a needs statement in the clinical domain, preserving the artifact identity without new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It should be coded as SCTID 404187006 because it denotes a formal statement of needs, not an assessment or action plan. Broader parents are imprecise, while siblings (e.g., Care plan, Preference statement) carry different semantics and intents."
224060002,Iowa (geographic location),"Iowa, United States","The phrase specifies Iowa and clarifies the country, but the core concept remains the state Iowa. Main concept: Iowa as a geographic location. Category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 224060002 is the most precise match because the entry identifies the exact state, not the broader parent United States nor any sub-location. Adding 'United States' does not introduce a different concept; it confirms context and is an equivalent way to denote the same location."
122592007,Acellular blood (serum or plasma) specimen (specimen),Specimen received: acellular blood (serum or plasma),"This entry indicates the received specimen is acellular blood, clarifying that it is serum or plasma without labeling one. The main concept is the specimen type. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to 122592007 because it denotes acellular blood (serum/plasma) and avoids more specific child codes. A generic Blood specimen parent would not reflect the acellular nature. Sibling concepts like Whole blood specimen are unsuitable. The wording remains semantically equivalent and does not add extraneous details."
180110005,Pelvic osteotomy for congenital deformity of hip (procedure),Clinician documentation: pelvic osteotomy for congenital hip deformity,"This documentation entry directly states a pelvic osteotomy and the indication of congenital hip deformity. The concept is pelvic osteotomy; attribute is congenital hip deformity. Category: Procedure. SCTID 180110005 is the exact match because it encodes pelvic osteotomy performed for congenital deformity of the hip. Parent concepts are less specific, and sibling/child concepts that narrow to acetabular-only techniques or other anatomical sites are not indicated. The contextual phrase “Clinician documentation” does not add attributes like laterality or timing, preserving the intended mapping."
736284000,Diabetes clinical management plan (record artifact),Summary: diabetes plan of care,"This entry indicates a summary noting a plan of care for diabetes, which is a clinical management plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. ""Plan of care"" is clinically interchangeable with ""clinical management plan"" and does not add attributes such as diabetes type or severity. Diabetes clinical management plan (736284000) is therefore the precise match. Parent concepts are too nonspecific, and type-specific or self-management plan siblings would not align with the general, condition-focused wording."
223739007,Nicobar islands (geographic location),Nicobar Islands,"The entry explicitly names the geographic entity “Nicobar Islands,” which is a group of islands and matches the SNOMED CT concept Nicobar islands (geographic location) SCTID 223739007. The category is Environment or geographical location. This is the most precise match because it refers exactly to the island group, not a broader region like Andaman and Nicobar Islands (parent/related region) or a more specific single island such as Great Nicobar (child/sibling specificity). No additional attributes (e.g., timing, cause, clinical status) are introduced, so the location concept alone is correctly represented."
9421000146109,Advance directives (record artifact),Advance directives documentation,"The wording emphasizes the recorded documentation of advance directives as an artifact in the health record, with no reference to presence/absence or specific directive types. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Record artifact; the exact concept is Advance directives (record artifact) [9421000146109]. Parent concepts like generic 'document' are insufficiently specific, and child/sibling concepts such as 'POLST' or 'Living will' introduce specificity not present here. It does not convey a finding or intervention, so those hierarchies are excluded."
334717009,Odor absorbing dressing (physical object),Odour-absorbing wound dressing,"Main concept: wound dressing designed to absorb odour (UK spelling). No extra attributes such as material or medicated components are present. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This maps to Odor absorbing dressing (SCTID: 334717009). The odor-absorbing property differentiates it from parent concepts like generic dressings, and the absence of specific composition or sterility avoids mapping to more specialized children. Therefore, this synonym is clinically equivalent and supports the same code."
249151001,Reversal of uterine contraction wave (finding),Reversed direction of uterine contraction propagation,"This statement directly indicates that the uterine contraction propagation direction is reversed. It is a Clinical finding and matches SCTID 249151001. There are no added attributes such as timing, severity, or etiological details; the entry remains constrained to direction reversal. Parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling findings dealing with contraction rate or strength would be inaccurate. The phrasing is a clear synonym for 'reversal of uterine contraction wave,' ensuring precise coding."
413350009,Finding with explicit context (situation),Context-specified finding (situation),"The phrase indicates a finding whose statement includes explicit context, and it is labeled as a situation, fitting the SNOMED category Situation with explicit context. It does not identify any particular context values, nor a specific clinical finding, avoiding more granular children such as history, family history, or present/absent situations. The restriction to 'finding' makes this more specific than the generic parent situation concept, matching 413350009."
417319006,Record of health event (record artifact),Health event recorded for longitudinal history,"The text indicates that a health event has been recorded to support longitudinal history, emphasizing the existence of the record artifact rather than the clinical event or a specific history document type. Category: Record artifact. SNOMED CT 417319006 is the best match because it represents the record of the event; it does not claim a specialized artifact like a past medical history note, so child or sibling concepts tied to history sections are less appropriate. The wording is a contextual paraphrase that remains within the scope of a generic health event record."
23275005,Mixed liver function (observable entity),Mixed liver function documented,"The wording indicates documentation of liver function interpreted as 'mixed,' aligning with SNOMED CT 23275005 (Observable entity). It avoids additional attributes like severity or timing and does not shift the concept to a procedure or finding. Parent classes are overly broad, and siblings (normal, decreased, increased) are not indicated. 'Documented' is contextual and does not affect code selection."
29937006,Structure of prerubral area (body structure),Anatomical term: prerubral area,"Calling it an 'anatomical term' simply frames the prerubral area as a named body structure, without introducing any new attributes. It belongs to the Body structure hierarchy and matches SNOMED CT 29937006. This does not default to a broader parent or imply a different sibling region. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and retains the precise anatomical scope."
315063009,Community care assessment completed (situation),Patient reports community care assessment completed.,"This entry frames the completion status as patient-reported but still conveys only that the community care assessment is completed, with no time or outcome. The concept is the completed state of a community care assessment, categorized as a Situation. SNOMED CT 315063009 is the correct specific code. Parent or sibling concepts would either be non-specific or reflect different statuses. Patient report is a documentation context and does not alter the completion meaning or code selection."
421672009,South Dakota (geographic location),"South Dakota, United States","This entry denotes the state of South Dakota and further situates it within the United States, which is a neutral geographic qualifier rather than an attribute such as residence or origin. It is a Geographic location (Location hierarchy) and the best match is South Dakota (geographic location), SCTID 421672009. The mention of 'United States' prevents ambiguity, but the target remains the specific state. Parent (United States) and child (e.g., Sioux Falls) concepts are inappropriate granularity for the wording."
260219009,P200 (P2) (qualifier value),Peak name: P200 (P2),"The text identifies the peak by its established name P200 (P2) and does not introduce timing values, amplitudes, interpretations, or modality context, so SNOMED CT 260219009 (Qualifier value) fits precisely. A parent term such as generic 'peak name' would be too broad, and sibling peaks (e.g., P100, P300) would not match. 'Peak name' is contextual wording that does not alter the concept; P2 is a clinically equivalent synonym of P200."
224914001,Eleventh floor and above of building (environment),Building floor location: 12th floor,"The statement specifies a building environment and an exact floor number at 12, which is ≥11. Main concept: building floor 12. No added attributes beyond the floor level. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Given it is ≥11, SCTID 224914001 is the most precise match. More general ‘floor of building’ is less specific, and concepts for ground/first/third-to-tenth floors are inappropriate. This does not introduce any events or conditions, maintaining a pure location entry."
177079006,Admission review (procedure),Underwent admission review,"This narrative states that the admission review procedure occurred, which still denotes the same procedure without adding attributes like timing, purpose, or outcome. It maps to Admission review (procedure) [177079006] and sits in the Procedure category. It is not an admission assessment (a different procedural focus) nor a utilization review subtype with specific criteria. The verb 'underwent' does not alter the core concept; it simply indicates performance of the procedure."
310100005,Play therapy service (qualifier value),Play therapy service code,"The text references the code for the service type 'play therapy', indicating a service classification. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the precise concept is Play therapy service [310100005]. No therapeutic event is described, so procedure codes are not appropriate. This phrasing remains aligned with the service-type qualifier without adding clinical attributes."
736716007,Nitinol lung volume reduction coil (physical object),Nitinol bronchoscopic lung volume reduction coil,Describing the device in its typical bronchoscopic context does not change the fact that it is a nitinol lung volume reduction coil. The correct mapping is SNOMED CT Physical object 736716007. The phrase does not assert that a procedure occurred; it retains device identity and excludes broader or different device types.
128249007,Structure of vermilion border of lip (body structure),Imaging annotation: vermilion border of lip,"This imaging context labels the anatomical structure as the vermilion border of the lip. The concept category is Body structure (Anatomical structure). No extra attributes or subsite qualifiers are present, so child concepts are not indicated. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts like 'Vermilion of lip' refer to different anatomy. The annotated structure matches 'Structure of vermilion border of lip' exactly."
700301010000109,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Polistes (substance),Polistes (paper wasp) IgG,"This concise entry denotes an IgG antibody to Polistes, with parenthetical clarification of the common name. Main concept: immunoglobulin G antibody against Polistes. SNOMED CT category: Substance. No added attributes such as venom, specimen, or positivity are present. The specificity matches SCTID 700301010000109, excluding parent or sibling concepts that lack the Polistes target or change the immunoglobulin class."
1370849007,Gleason scoring system for prostatic cancer by pT category (staging scale),Reporting standard used: Gleason scoring system for prostatic cancer by pT category (staging scale),"This line indicates the reporting standard—the staging scale—being used: Gleason scoring for prostate cancer organized by pT category. It refers to the classification instrument rather than any patient-level result. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale (assessment scale). The presence of “by pT category” targets SCTID 1370849007 specifically and avoids mapping to related but distinct scales (e.g., TNM overall staging, non-pT Gleason frameworks). The phrasing uses synonymous terminology for the scale and does not introduce new attributes."
733740006,Ischemic ulcer absent (situation),Ischemic ulcer absent.,"The statement explicitly asserts the absence of an ischemic ulcer, which is a negated finding context for the concept 'ischemic ulcer.' This fits the SNOMED CT category Situation with explicit context, because it encodes a clinical situation where the finding (ischemic ulcer) is absent. SCTID 733740006 'Ischemic ulcer absent (situation)' is the most precise match. More general parent concepts like 'Ulcer absent' would be too broad, and any child or sibling concepts that specify presence, site, severity, or type would not apply. The phrasing is a direct synonym for the preferred term without adding attributes."
716561000,Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score (observable entity),Score on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test,"This entry describes the measured score obtained from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, which is a precise Observable entity. It maps to SNOMED CT “Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score” (716561000). The phrasing does not introduce interpretation, numeric values, versions, or timing; it strictly references the score as a property of the PPVT. Choosing the test procedure concept would be incorrect, as the entry is about the quantitative/qualitative score, not the act of testing. More granular child concepts like specific subscore types are not indicated, making the generic PPVT score the most accurate match."
762451005,Chronic pain following trauma (finding),History of chronic pain following an injury,"The entry indicates a chronic pain condition that follows an injury; “injury” here serves as a common clinical synonym for trauma. It specifies chronicity and post-injury (post-trauma) linkage without adding site or severity. This is a Clinical finding that best matches Chronic pain following trauma (SCTID 762451005). Choosing Chronic pain (parent) ignores the injury linkage, and Pain following trauma without chronicity would be less accurate. The use of “injury” is clinically equivalent to trauma in this context and does not change the code selection."
1187301002,Norfolk Island (geographic location),Jurisdiction: Norfolk Island,"The entry presents ""Norfolk Island"" as a jurisdiction, but the value to code is the geographic location. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is Norfolk Island (geographic location), SCTID 1187301002, under the Geographic location category. The administrative framing does not alter the place concept or introduce a different entity. There is no indication of broader or sibling jurisdictions, keeping the mapping focused on the specific location."
395479007,Cricetomys emini (organism),Emin’s pouched rat (Cricetomys emini),"This entry uses the established common name 'Emin’s pouched rat' and explicitly anchors it to the scientific name Cricetomys emini, ensuring species-level precision. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The pairing eliminates ambiguity with the Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) and maps to SCTID 395479007. No additional attributes are included; it solely identifies the organism."
768613008,Product containing nucleoside analog (product),Medication: nucleoside analog,"This phrasing indicates a medication (i.e., a medicinal product) specified by its ingredient class, nucleoside analog. It avoids additional attributes such as dose, route, or therapeutic intent and thus fits the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category. The SNOMED CT concept Product containing nucleoside analog (product) [768613008] is the most precise match. A substance-level concept would be inappropriate because the context is a medication/product, and a child concept naming a particular analog would be more specific than the entry indicates."
128449009,Pulmonary artery wedge pressure waveform (observable entity),Waveform of pulmonary artery wedge pressure,"The phrase explicitly states the waveform of the pulmonary artery wedge pressure, identifying the graphical representation of the wedge pressure signal. This is an Observable entity. SNOMED CT 128449009 is the exact match since it represents the pulmonary artery wedge pressure waveform. Broader parent categories such as waveform or pressure waveform are nonspecific, and siblings like pulmonary artery wedge pressure (measurement) do not convey that this is the waveform. The wording introduces no interpretation, values, or timing and remains confined to the waveform concept."
25009005,Human rhinovirus 36 (organism),Human rhinovirus serotype 36,"This entry names the organism as a specific serotype—“Human rhinovirus serotype 36”—which is semantically equivalent to Human rhinovirus 36. No clinical findings or detection statements are present. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact serotype reference supports SCTID 25009005; parent concepts (e.g., generic human rhinovirus) are too general, and sibling serotypes are not what’s named here."
1255924005,Does not meet eligibility criteria for breast conservation surgery (situation),BCS eligibility not met,"The acronym BCS stands for breast-conserving surgery, and the entry states that eligibility is not met, with no additional attributes included. Category: Situation with explicit context. This directly matches 'does not meet eligibility criteria for breast conservation surgery.' Parent concepts are less specific, and siblings such as 'eligible for BCS' or 'BCS contraindicated' would miscode the situation. The abbreviation does not change the semantic meaning."
1162650002,Second dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 recombinant spike protein antigen vaccine declined (situation),Refused the second administration of COVID-19 recombinant spike protein antigen vaccine.,"The entry points to refusal of the 'second administration' of a specifically described COVID-19 recombinant spike protein antigen vaccine. Category: Situation. This maps precisely to 1162650002, which is for the second dose being declined. Using a parent concept without dose specificity or a sibling concept covering other dose numbers would not reflect the documented event. 'Administration' is a standard synonym for 'dose' in vaccination context and maintains the same meaning."
264497002,Structure of ulnar collateral ligament of metacarpophalangeal joint of thumb (body structure),Target structure: thumb MCP UCL,"Declaring “target structure” simply contextualizes that the focus is on the anatomy, namely the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb MCP joint. No injury, status, or laterality of the hand is added. This is a Body structure and best maps to “Structure of ulnar collateral ligament of metacarpophalangeal joint of thumb.” A general collateral ligament parent would be overly broad, and a sibling such as the radial collateral ligament is not implied. Accessory versus proper UCL variants are not mentioned, so child concepts are not more appropriate. The abbreviation UCL is clinically equivalent when explicitly tied to thumb MCP."
223396004,Raiatea (geographic location),Raiatea,"The entry states only the place name “Raiatea,” which is a specific geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value under Geographic location. SCTID 223396004 (Raiatea (geographic location)) is the most precise match because it identifies this exact toponym without adding attributes such as country, administrative level, or related events. Broader parents like Geographic location or siblings (e.g., other Society Islands) would be less appropriate due to loss of specificity. No extra attributes (timing, laterality, severity, cause, residence/travel) are introduced."
782659005,Cystoscopy report (record artifact),Cystoscopy report summary document,"This entry specifies a summary-style document that is still the cystoscopy report, maintaining the identity of a record artifact. The appropriate SNOMED CT mapping is “Cystoscopy report (record artifact)” (SCTID: 782659005) within the Record artifact category. The term “summary” describes the format, not content attributes like findings or interpretations, and does not change the concept. More generic report types or the cystoscopy procedure concept are less accurate than the cystoscopy-specific report artifact."
733677009,Epicranial brain electrical stimulation system (physical object),Epicranial brain E-stim system,"Main concept: electrical stimulation system targeting the brain via an epicranial approach. Category: Physical object. The abbreviation ‘E-stim’ is a common shorthand for electrical stimulation and remains semantically equivalent. The entry is still an object/system, not a procedure or a finding. More general parent objects (e.g., neurostimulator system) would lack the epicranial brain specificity, while siblings that imply different placement or modality (e.g., deep brain or magnetic systems) are not appropriate."
89602001,Structure of risorius muscle (body structure),Risorius muscle anatomy,"This phrase refers to the anatomy of the risorius muscle, i.e., the anatomical structure itself, without adding any clinical findings or modifiers. The category is Body structure. SCTID 89602001 is the correct code because the entry targets the risorius muscle specifically. Mapping to a parent (e.g., facial muscles) would lose specificity, and siblings are distinct muscles. 'Anatomy' here is descriptive and does not introduce additional attributes."
397653009,Finding of ability to hear (finding),Care plan mentions ability to hear,"While documented in a care plan, the entry still centers on the finding of hearing ability without adding attributes like severity or etiology. The correct SNOMED CT Clinical finding is 'Finding of ability to hear' (397653009). Broader hearing findings omit the ability focus, and specific outcomes (normal, impaired) would over-specify beyond what is written."
411971004,Calcium sulfate bone graft pellet (product),Discharge summary—calcium sulfate bone graft pellet,"Mentioned in a discharge summary, the product remains a calcium sulfate bone graft pellet. Category: Product (device). SCTID 411971004 is the most precise match. Parent concepts too broad or sibling concepts that alter form/material would be inaccurate. The context does not introduce attributes; it simply references the product used or present."
309068002,Skin lesion specimen (specimen),Skin lesion sample,"The term ‘sample’ is a common clinical synonym for ‘specimen’ and does not imply method or material type. Category: Specimen. This maps precisely to Skin lesion specimen (309068002), as it indicates a specimen obtained from a skin lesion. Using ‘sample’ does not change the code selection and avoids more specific child concepts (e.g., biopsy, swab) or broader parent concepts (e.g., skin specimen without lesion)."
441695007,Specimen from parotid gland obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Report header: Specimen—parotid gland fine-needle aspirate,"This report-style entry designates the specimen as a fine-needle aspirate from the parotid gland, preserving the exact site and collection technique. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 441695007 aligns precisely with this description. Parent concepts missing parotid specificity or aspirate method, and sibling concepts indicating other biopsy types, do not match the wording. The phrasing is a direct synonym and remains limited to the intended attributes."
838396004,Tissue oxygen monitoring sensor (physical object),History note: tissue oxygen monitoring sensor,"This reflects documentation context, but the device referenced is a sensor intended for monitoring oxygen in tissue. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). It matches 838396004, since the phrase identifies a tissue oxygen monitoring sensor without adding technological, anatomical, or procedural attributes. Parent categories (generic sensors) lack specificity, and sibling/child concepts such as cerebral oximetry sensors or transcutaneous oxygen sensors are too specific. The history context does not add a new attribute; it keeps the target concept centered on the sensor component used for tissue oxygen monitoring."
68262008,Montana Myotis leukoencephalitis virus (organism),Montana Myotis leukoencephalitis virus taxonomic entity,"This phrase identifies the named virus Montana Myotis leukoencephalitis virus and describes it as a taxonomic entity, which is purely classificatory. It should be coded as an Organism in SNOMED CT, with SCTID 68262008 representing the species. No clinical attributes such as positivity, infection, or host are introduced, avoiding finding/disorder codes. A generic parent like Virus is too broad, and different viral species would be siblings. Without strain-level details, the species organism code is the precise match."
309639004,Clinical diagnostic instrument (physical object),Diagnostic instrument available for clinical assessment,"The phrase describes availability of a diagnostic instrument for clinical assessment without naming any particular type or adding attributes beyond function. The concept is a physical object intended for diagnosis, aligning with Clinical diagnostic instrument (physical object). It does not imply a different category, such as monitoring or therapeutic equipment, and avoids specificity that would point to a child concept. Parent concepts like Physical object or generic device are too broad; SCTID 309639004 best fits the wording."
223653001,Lithuania (geographic location),History note lists: Lithuania,"In a history note, Lithuania is listed; this entry conveys only the geographic location value. Category: Location (geographic location). The appropriate code is Lithuania (geographic location) SCTID 223653001. No additional attributes are introduced, avoiding misclassification to contextual findings or other location-related concepts."
102433005,Occupational exposure to polluted soil (event),On-the-job exposure to contaminated soil.,"“On-the-job” denotes an occupational context, and “contaminated soil” is synonymous with polluted soil, together describing an exposure Event. The concept’s category is Event. SCTID 102433005 is the precise code because it captures both the occupational qualifier and the polluted soil hazard. A parent concept without the occupational qualifier would be less specific, and siblings lacking the pollution attribute would not match the wording. The synonyms used are standard clinical phrasing and preserve the intended meaning without adding timing, severity, or route."
788891004,Chronic pain after cancer treatment (finding),Chronic pain after cancer treatment,"The entry explicitly denotes persistent pain in the chronic timeframe and links its occurrence to prior cancer treatment. The main concepts are chronic pain and the causal/temporal relationship to cancer treatment. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT. SCTID 788891004 is the most precise match because it encodes chronic pain following cancer treatment without specifying modality or location. Coding to a parent like “Chronic pain” would omit the treatment-related etiology, and children such as “Chronic postprocedural pain after oncologic surgery” or “Chronic pain due to chemotherapy” would be too specific. The phrasing uses direct equivalents (“after” indicating post-treatment), maintaining semantic equivalence to the preferred term."
117899001,Measurement of collagen antibody (procedure),Measurement of collagen antibody,"This is a direct restatement of the preferred term, explicitly identifying measurement of antibodies to collagen, a Procedure. It maps exactly to Measurement of collagen antibody (117899001). No additional attributes (method, specimen, immunoglobulin class, collagen subtype, timing, or result) are included. Parent concepts like generic antibody measurement are too broad, and children specifying type of collagen or method would be narrower than the phrase indicates."
67401002,Irrigation of biliary tube (procedure),Biliary tube was flushed,"The statement documents that flushing (synonymous with irrigation) was performed on a biliary tube. The concept is the procedure of irrigating the biliary tube, with no mention of solution, guidance, or tube subtype. This is a Procedure. SCTID 67401002 Irrigation of biliary tube (procedure) is appropriate. Parent concepts such as general tube irrigation are too broad, and child concepts like T-tube irrigation are too narrow. No alternative device (e.g., stent) is referenced, making sibling codes unsuitable."
36481000087109,Alternaria penicillata (organism),Specimen organism: Alternaria penicillata,"This indicates that the organism in the specimen is Alternaria penicillata, focusing on the taxon. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Organism, matched precisely by Alternaria penicillata (SCTID: 36481000087109). Parent concepts like Alternaria spp. or Fungi are too broad, and sibling species are different organisms. The phrase does not introduce attributes such as infection, site, or timing; it simply names the organism."
251893009,Symptom ratings (staging scale),Symptom ratings staging scale administered,"The phrase indicates that the 'Symptom ratings' staging scale was administered, but the coded concept is the scale itself. Main concept: named staging scale. Category: Qualifier value. Administration is context and does not shift to a procedure code. Parent staging scale is too general; specific scales (siblings/children) are not mentioned. No new attributes like score or severity are added."
239511007,Excision arthroplasty of the metatarsophalangeal joint of hallux (procedure),Excision arthroplasty at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux,"The phrase identifies an excision arthroplasty and the anatomic location as the hallux MTP joint. Concepts: excision arthroplasty and hallux metatarsophalangeal joint. Category: Procedure. It most precisely maps to 239511007 because it combines the specific technique (excision) with the defined joint (hallux MTP). More general arthroplasty codes would be less specific, and sibling procedures such as fusion or cheilectomy denote different surgical approaches. No child-level qualifiers (e.g., interposition) are implied here."
411721006,Mare's milk diagnostic allergen extract (product),Mare’s milk allergen reagent (diagnostic use),"The entry indicates a reagent of mare’s milk allergen intended for diagnostic use, which is a diagnostic allergen extract product. The main concept is a product used for allergy testing, with the allergen source specified. SNOMED CT category: Product. This is the best match for 411721006 because it precisely conveys diagnostic intent and source without implying therapy. Parent categories would be too broad, and siblings such as therapeutic reagents or mare’s milk substance would misrepresent the product. The parenthetical is a clarifier that preserves equivalence."
229529006,"Passive movements to the ankle joint, function (observable entity)",Checklist item—passive ankle movement function,"Presented as a checklist item, this still denotes the function of passive ankle movement as an observable. Concepts: passive movement, ankle, function. No degrees, laterality, or outcomes are stated. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The best match is SCTID 229529006, focusing on the functional aspect of passive movement at the ankle. This does not imply active movement, ROM measurement, or any procedure. The context 'checklist item' simply reflects documentation style."
172217003,Total excision of eyelid (procedure),Complete eyelid excision,"This entry conveys that the eyelid was excised completely, which semantically equals total excision and corresponds to SNOMED CT Total excision of eyelid (procedure) SCTID 172217003. The category is Procedure. No extra attributes (laterality, upper/lower, indication, or technique adjuncts) are present. A parent concept such as Excision of eyelid is insufficiently specific, and siblings like partial excision or cosmetic blepharoplasty are inconsistent with 'complete.' Children with specified eyelid segments are not implied by the wording."
223863007,English counties (geographic location),England's counties,"The phrase 'England's counties' is a possessive paraphrase equivalent to 'English counties,' referring to the set of county-level geographic locations in England. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). It matches SCTID 223863007, not the parent concept 'England' nor any specific county child concepts. It is also distinct from sibling administrative units like regional groupings. No additional attributes (e.g., residence, travel, timing) are implied."
227367004,Steamed fried tofu (substance),Bean curd—steamed and fried,‘Bean curd’ is a common synonym for tofu; specifying steamed and fried keeps the concept identical to steamed fried tofu. Category: Substance. This exact mapping is preferable to a broader bean curd/tofu parent and avoids misclassification under siblings limited to steamed or fried only. No extra attributes are introduced.
11162008,Cataclysm (physical force),Imaging indication: cataclysm (physical force),"Within an imaging indication, the concept recorded is cataclysm as a physical force, which maps cleanly to SNOMED CT 11162008. Category: Physical force. The entry remains nonspecific to any particular disaster type and adds no attributes, so Cataclysm (physical force) is more precise than the parent Physical force or any sibling event-based concept."
260773004,Chemical origin (qualifier value),Source identified as chemical origin,"The phrase identifies the source (etiology) as chemical, expressing the qualifier value. It maps to SNOMED CT Chemical origin (260773004). No additional details such as severity, timing, or named chemicals are provided, so child or sibling concepts are not a better fit. The documentation context does not change the concept selection."
441648008,Gibraltar (geographic location),Clinic site: Gibraltar,"The entry identifies Gibraltar as the clinic’s geographic site, making the place name the coded element. Gibraltar (geographic location), SCTID: 441648008, under Environment or geographical location, is the precise match. It does not specify a particular facility or neighborhood within Gibraltar, which would suggest a different child concept, nor does it refer to any other location."
411587009,Goat epithelium diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic goat epithelium allergen extract,"This paraphrase keeps all essential elements: diagnostic purpose, goat epithelium source, and allergen extract, classifying it within the Product hierarchy. The wording does not imply a specific testing method or dosing and thus does not drift toward procedural or substance formulations. Species-agnostic parents and species-mismatched siblings are less precise than SCTID 411587009."
9081000,Structure of splenic sinusoid (body structure),Spleen sinusoid,"The entry uses a concise anatomical phrasing for the same structure, indicating the sinusoid located in the spleen. There are no modifiers about abnormality or function. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It corresponds to 'Structure of splenic sinusoid' as a clinically accepted synonym. Using a parent like 'spleen' would be too general, and siblings like 'splenic vein' or 'splenic artery' denote different vascular components. The wording remains uniquely codable to the splenic sinusoid."
223554004,Burkina Faso (geographic location),Study location: Burkina Faso,"This entry provides the study location value as Burkina Faso. The coded concept is the national-level geographic location, fitting the Environment or geographical location hierarchy (semantic tag geographic location) in SNOMED CT. SCTID 223554004 is the precise code. The 'study' context does not convert this into a procedure or situation concept; it simply assigns a place. Parent concepts (continent/region) or child concepts (cities within Burkina Faso) are not indicated and would be less appropriate."
736926006,Genus Blastobotrys (organism),Yeast organism from genus Blastobotrys,"This entry notes the organism as a yeast and specifies the genus Blastobotrys, maintaining the taxonomic granularity at genus level without naming a species or implying a clinical condition. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The presence of the genus name makes Genus Blastobotrys (organism), SCTID 736926006, the exact match. A parent concept like 'Yeast (organism)' would be too broad, and no child species is indicated. The descriptor 'yeast' is descriptive and does not alter code selection."
224027000,Newfoundland island (geographic location),Specimen origin location: Newfoundland island.,"The location value is Newfoundland island, used as a specimen origin. The main concept identified is the geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Because the phrase explicitly references the island, SCTID 224027000 is the exact match; generic island or Canadian province concepts would be less specific. The context of specimen origin does not alter the coded location concept."
217338004,Explosion caused by conflagration in theater (event),Explosion from conflagration in theatre,"Using the British spelling “theatre” maintains the same meaning and location, identifying an explosion caused by a conflagration in that setting, which corresponds to SNOMED CT 217338004. The main elements are explosion, conflagration cause, and theater location, classed as an Event. Parents without the location or siblings for other settings are less appropriate. The spelling variation does not alter the concept or introduce new attributes."
56033007,Entire shaft of third rib (body structure),Entire longitudinal portion (shaft) of third rib,"This entry describes the shaft as the longitudinal portion of the third rib and specifies that the entire extent is intended; it is a Body structure. SCTID 56033007 is appropriate because it denotes the entire shaft of rib three. Broader concepts like the entire rib or other parts (head/neck/tubercle) are excluded, and partial segments are not implied. 'Longitudinal portion (shaft)' clarifies the same anatomical part without altering attributes."
49231000119106,History of primary hyperparathyroidism (situation),Self-reported history of primary hyperparathyroidism.,"The entry conveys that the patient self-reports a past history of primary hyperparathyroidism, preserving the non-current context. This is a SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context. The optimal code is “History of primary hyperparathyroidism (situation)”; it is more precise than a disorder code, which would indicate an active disease. Parent or sibling history concepts lacking the ‘primary’ specification would not match the wording. “Self-reported history” is a valid synonym that maintains the same meaning without adding attributes."
223553005,Benin (geographic location),Travel history notes: Benin,"This entry identifies Benin as the geographic location relevant to travel history. The main concept is the country Benin. Category: Location (geographic location). SCTID 223553005 is appropriate because it codes the specific country named; broader parents (e.g., Geographic location) lack specificity, and children/siblings (particular cities or neighboring countries) are not mentioned. The travel-history header provides context without altering the underlying location concept."
1145320000,Smooth philtrum (finding),Smooth philtrum,"The entry explicitly states the clinical finding of a smooth philtrum, referring to reduced or flattened philtral ridges. The main concept is the surface morphology of the philtrum being smooth, with no added attributes such as cause, severity, timing, or associated conditions. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT, and the most precise match is Smooth philtrum (1145320000). Broader parent concepts like abnormal philtrum or sibling findings such as short/long philtrum or thin upper lip are less appropriate, as the wording targets the specific smoothness feature."
257112007,DQB1*0603 (substance),DQB1*0603 (HLA class II),"This phrasing uses the allele name with the contextual clarification that DQB1 is an HLA class II locus, which is inherent to the concept. Category: Substance. It still points directly to the specific substance HLA-DQB1*0603, therefore 257112007 is the exact match. A parent like HLA class II antigen (substance) would be too broad, and any sibling allele (e.g., DQB1*0601) would be incorrect. The added parenthetical only situates the molecule within class II and does not introduce new attributes or a testing result."
19768003,Product containing alkylating agent (product),Drug product containing an alkylating agent,"This enumerates a drug product whose active component is an alkylating agent, directly matching SCTID 19768003 in the Product category. The entry does not specify route, dose, brand, or disease indication, so it does not point to child concepts. It is not generic enough to be a parent concept and does not imply alternative pharmacologic classes that would be siblings. The phrasing is a straightforward paraphrase that maintains the same clinical meaning and code."
170685002,Psychiatric treatment changed (situation),Psychiatric management changed,"The statement conveys that psychiatric management—another accepted term for treatment—has changed. No additional attributes such as direction, reason, or modality are given. This is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 170685002 best fits because it encodes the change in psychiatric treatment. A generic management change concept would be too broad, and specifying subcomponents (medications, therapy sessions) would be too detailed for the wording. The synonym “management” is clinically equivalent to “treatment” in psychiatric care and does not alter code selection."
443321000124106,Non-essential amino acid free infant formula (product),Current diet includes nonessential amino acid-free infant formula,"This note states that the patient’s diet includes an infant formula free of nonessential amino acids. The main concept is the Product, and the best SNOMED CT mapping is Non-essential amino acid free infant formula (product) SCTID 443321000124106. The dietary context does not add or change product attributes. A generic infant formula parent would be less precise, and sibling concepts with different amino acid exclusions would be inappropriate. The phrase 'nonessential amino acid-free' is a direct synonym of the preferred term."
1003720001,Product containing plasma protein (product),Plasma protein medicinal product,"This phrase denotes a medicinal product whose active ingredient component is plasma protein, without stating subtype, formulation, or therapeutic indication. The main concept is an ingredient-defined medicinal product. SNOMED CT category: Product. It best matches SCTID 1003720001 because the product contains plasma protein; no additional qualifiers push it to a child like albumin or immunoglobulin products. A parent such as ‘medicinal product’ would omit the plasma protein ingredient, making it less precise. ‘Medicinal product’ is a standard synonym within the product hierarchy and does not change the concept."
110938007,Duodenal cytologic material (specimen),Duodenal cell sample (cytology),"This entry indicates a sample of cells from the duodenum for cytologic examination, reflecting cytologic material rather than tissue biopsy or fluid collection. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to 110938007, specifying duodenal origin and cellular nature; it is not a broader specimen nor a method-specific subtype. The synonym “cell sample” is equivalent to cytologic material and does not add attributes like technique or associated conditions, maintaining the precise code."
468522009,Diagnostic-imaging multiformat camera (physical object),Multiformat diagnostic-imaging camera,"This concise phrase keeps both the multiformat and diagnostic-imaging qualifiers, directly naming the device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It maps precisely to SCTID 468522009 because the multiformat camera used in diagnostic imaging is the defined object. It does not add timing, model, or modality details, avoiding misclassification to parent or sibling device concepts."
736384002,Major orthopedic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient plan of care for orthopaedic major surgery,"This is a plan of care (care plan) for major orthopaedic surgery in the inpatient setting, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 736384002. Category: Record artifact. The wording does not specify procedure type, timing, or additional qualifiers beyond those inherent to the concept. Parent concepts (e.g., generic plan of care) are too broad, and any child or sibling that narrows scope (e.g., hip surgery plan or outpatient plan) would not fit this exact phrasing."
423043004,Human enterovirus A (organism),Virus: human enterovirus A,"This contextual label identifies the organism as a virus, specifically human enterovirus A. The core concept remains the organism; SNOMED category is Organism with code 423043004. It does not introduce attributes like positivity, isolation, or causality—merely labels the taxonomic type. Parents and children are less appropriate due to either being too broad or too specific."
417037004,Nursing intraoperative record (record artifact),Intraoperative nursing documentation available,"Availability status aside, the entry identifies the nursing documentation created intraoperatively, i.e., the specific record artifact. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s Record artifact category and best maps to 417037004 Nursing intraoperative record. Parent records would omit nursing/intraoperative qualifiers, while sibling documents (e.g., surgeon’s operative report) differ in authorship. The synonym ‘documentation’ is equivalent to ‘record’ without changing attributes."
346636007,Plasma protein solution (product),Medication list: plasma protein solution,"Within a medication list, 'plasma protein solution' denotes the exact medicinal product and maps to Plasma protein solution (product), SCTID 346636007 under Product. The context does not introduce administration details or concentration, so procedural or child-specific codes are avoided. The synonym does not modify the clinical meaning and remains the most precise match for the concept."
59011009,Structure of basilar artery (body structure),Basilar artery,"The entry names the anatomical vessel 'basilar artery' directly, which is the body structure represented by SNOMED CT 59011009. There are no additional attributes such as pathology, laterality, or segments; it simply denotes the artery itself. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This is more precise than a parent like 'artery' or 'cerebral artery' and does not narrow to any child such as 'tip of basilar artery,' 'lumen of basilar artery,' or 'basilar artery wall.' The wording exactly matches the concept without introducing new qualifiers."
358253005,Glucose free acetate hemodialysis liquid concentrate (product),"Acetate HD concentrate, liquid, no glucose","This phrase denotes a hemodialysis (HD) fluid product concentrate with acetate buffering, in liquid form, and explicitly “no glucose.” The concept is a Product (dialysis fluid product) and matches SCTID 358253005 because it pinpoints glucose-free acetate hemodialysis liquid concentrate. More general parents (e.g., hemodialysis concentrate) do not specify acetate or glucose content, while siblings like bicarbonate concentrate or glucose-containing acetate concentrate are ruled out by the explicit modifiers. The abbreviation “HD” for hemodialysis and “no glucose” as a synonym for glucose-free do not alter the intended code."
312253001,Heavy ion radiation (physical force),Heavy ion radiation documented,"This entry indicates that the agent heavy ion radiation was documented, without adding exposure or procedure context. It maps to SNOMED CT 312253001 in the Physical force category. Parents such as Ionizing radiation are more general, and siblings (e.g., proton radiation) are not referenced. The documentation context does not change the underlying concept being the radiation type itself."
116494006,Rapid growing mycobacteria (organism),Mycobacterial rapid-growth group (rapidly growing mycobacteria),"The entry explicitly denotes the group of mycobacteria defined by rapid growth and provides a synonymous clarification. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It remains within organism classification without introducing clinical attributes. Parent and sibling organism groups are less precise because the growth-rate qualifier is stated, and child species are not included."
258500001,Nasopharyngeal swab (specimen),Source: nasopharyngeal swab specimen,"The entry states the specimen source is a nasopharyngeal swab, which denotes a specific specimen class. This fits the Specimen category and maps to Nasopharyngeal swab (specimen) SCTID 258500001. Using 'source' does not change the concept or imply procedure; it simply indicates the material's origin. Broader parent concepts or sibling site/method variants are excluded by the explicit combination of nasopharynx and swab."
276506001,Neonatal death (event),Neonatal death occurred,"The wording directly states that a death event took place during the neonatal period, placing it in the Event category. This maps precisely to Neonatal death (event) without adding cause, setting, or sub-period qualifiers. The broader Death (event) would be less specific, and Early/Late neonatal death would over-specify. Perinatal or infant death would not reflect the exact neonatal timeframe."
285655001,Mechanical stress (physical force),Mechanical stress (physical force),"This entry mirrors the SNOMED CT fully specified name, explicitly clarifying the Physical force category. It contains no supplemental attributes like site, severity, timing, or subtype. The exact concept is Mechanical stress (physical force) SCTID 285655001; selecting a parent would under-specify, and choosing a child (e.g., compressive or tensile stress) would over-specify. The clarifier '(physical force)' confirms the category and does not change the concept."
470090000,Humidity meter (physical object),Humidity meter,"The entry explicitly names a humidity meter, which is a physical object used to measure ambient humidity. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This matches SCTID 470090000 precisely because it denotes the generic device without implying any specific subtype or features. More general parents like measuring device are too broad, and children such as digital hygrometer or psychrometer would be too specific and are not stated. Sibling concepts (e.g., moisture meter for materials or humidity sensor components) are different devices and are not implied."
3550001000004108,Presence of receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 in primary malignant neoplasm of breast by immunohistochemistry (observable entity),Primary breast cancer—HER2 present on immunohistochemistry.,"The entry indicates the primary breast cancer context and the presence of HER2 detected by immunohistochemistry. This matches the observable entity for presence of erbB-2 in primary malignant neoplasm of breast by IHC. It avoids alternative methodologies, absence, or graded overexpression terms, maintaining precise alignment with the concept rather than parent/sibling variants."
13271000087106,Doppler ultrasonography of left iliac artery (procedure),Doppler ultrasound of the left iliac artery,"This wording indicates an ultrasound procedure employing Doppler on the left iliac artery, with clear laterality and arterial site. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps most precisely to Doppler ultrasonography of left iliac artery (13271000087106) because it explicitly includes the Doppler technique and the left iliac arterial target, without adding segment (common/internal/external) or bilateral scope. Mapping to a parent like generic iliac artery ultrasound would omit Doppler; mapping to a child like left common iliac artery Doppler would over-specify. The synonym 'Doppler ultrasound' is clinically equivalent to 'Doppler ultrasonography' and does not alter code selection."
866033003,Blood specimen in aerobic blood culture bottle (specimen),Aerobic blood culture bottle containing blood specimen,"This entry states the container (aerobic blood culture bottle) and its contents (blood specimen), directly indicating the intended specimen concept. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to SCTID 866033003 because it clearly denotes blood as the specimen and aerobic blood culture bottle as the container. It is more specific than generic 'blood specimen' and does not add attributes such as anaerobic media, pediatric bottle, source site, or timing that would align with sibling or child concepts. No procedural elements are included."
30821001,Electromagnetic radiation (physical force),Electromagnetic radiation term utilized,"The entry notes the use of the term electromagnetic radiation, without introducing attributes regarding subtype, exposure, or source. The concept is a Physical force and corresponds to SCTID 30821001. Parent concepts would be overly broad, and children such as ultraviolet or ionizing radiation are not specified. Sibling concepts like electromagnetic field are distinct. The phrase about term utilization is purely contextual and does not modify the core concept."
6769007,Attention function (observable entity),General attention function,"“General” signals the non-subtyped attention function, consistent with the Observable entity. It stays neutral, without impairment or results. SCTID 6769007 is the exact match because it covers attention function broadly. Parent categories are overly general, and child subtypes (sustained, selective, divided) are not intended. No procedure or disorder is implied."
729118009,Entire ampulla of anterior semicircular canal (body structure),Imaging label: entire ampulla of anterior semicircular canal,"The text labels the entire ampulla of the anterior semicircular canal for imaging purposes, naming the complete structure without adding condition or laterality attributes. The primary concept is the whole ampulla of the anterior semicircular canal. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The correct mapping is to Entire ampulla of anterior semicircular canal (SCTID: 729118009). The contextual term 'imaging label' does not alter the anatomical entity; more general parents or sibling ampullae from other canals do not capture the specified whole anterior canal ampulla."
701341003,Aerosol inhalation monitor (physical object),Aerosol inhalation monitor equipment item,The device is identified as an equipment item while retaining the exact monitoring scope: aerosol inhalation. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This maps accurately to SCTID 701341003. The qualifier 'equipment item' is a documentation context and does not change the physical object type. Parent concepts (monitoring device) lack the aerosol inhalation specificity; siblings are different device categories.
223868003,Cambridgeshire (geographic location),Cambs,"“Cambs” is the widely used abbreviation for Cambridgeshire and refers to the same county-level geographic location. The category is Geographic location. The synonym does not introduce any new attribute or a different place; it is a clinically and administratively recognized shorthand that still maps uniquely to Cambridgeshire, not to parent regions or child localities."
256243004,Beta radiation (physical force),Follow-up note includes beta radiation,"This entry indicates that beta radiation is mentioned in follow-up documentation, retaining the radiation concept. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 256243004 best fits because no other attributes (e.g., exposure, source, severity) are present. Broader parent terms and other radiation-type siblings are less precise or incorrect."
26131009,Lead tetramethyl (substance),Follow-up note references lead tetramethyl,"This entry references the substance name lead tetramethyl, equivalent to tetramethyllead, and introduces no clinical attributes. The correct SNOMED CT category is Substance, with Lead tetramethyl (substance) SCTID 26131009 as the exact match. Broader categories or other organolead compounds would not fit, and the context does not turn it into an exposure or finding concept."
400759000,Low protein gluten free pasta (product),Meal plan selection: pasta that is gluten free and low in protein,"This narrative selects a pasta product, explicitly stating it is gluten free and low in protein. The category is Product. SCTID 400759000 is the correct code because it represents the specific combination of pasta with both attributes. Parent concepts missing one qualifier or sibling concepts not specifying pasta would be less accurate. The paraphrase 'low in protein' is clinically equivalent to 'low protein' and does not alter coding."
16885006,Trimellitic acid (substance),"Identified compound: benzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid","The compound identified is benzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, an accepted synonym for trimellitic acid. This is a Substance concept, mapping to SNOMED CT SCTID 16885006. The entry avoids attributes such as measurement values or exposure statements and does not suggest broader parent categories or different isomers/derivatives. As the naming precisely matches trimellitic acid, the specific substance code is the correct choice."
242451007,Accident caused by smoke from conflagration in commercial premises (event),Accident due to smoke during commercial building fire,"This phrasing conveys an accidental event due to smoke exposure occurring during a fire in a commercial building, which is semantically equivalent to 'commercial premises.' The main concept is the accident caused by smoke in the context of a conflagration at a commercial site. SNOMED CT category: Event. The code 242451007 is the most specific match as it specifies smoke as the cause, a conflagration, and the location type. Parent concepts lacking the commercial setting or siblings referring to non-commercial premises would not fit this wording. 'Commercial building' is a valid synonym for 'commercial premises' and does not change the code selection."
718171000,Office of Population Census and Surveys disability scales score (observable entity),OPCS disability score (OPCS disability scales),"This is a concise synonym clarifying that the disability score is from the OPCS disability scales, which makes it equivalent to the OPCS disability scales score observable. Category: Observable entity. It maps to 718171000 because the instrument and score are identified. Using only 'disability score' would risk a parent concept, but the OPCS qualifier ensures precision. Procedure siblings are not relevant because the text indicates the score, not the performance of the assessment."
411248008,DMDM Hydantoin (in water) (product),"DMDM hydantoin, water medium","The term 'water medium' signifies that the product is carried in water, equivalent to 'in water' and free of added attributes like strength or route. This is a Product concept, specifically DMDM Hydantoin (in water) (product) [411248008]. A general product parent lacks the specified medium, and siblings reflecting alternative media or concentrations would not align. The synonym does not change the code selection and remains precise."
25070008,Human rhinovirus 25 (organism),Organism: HRV-25,"‘Organism: HRV-25’ labels the entity as an organism and uses the recognized abbreviation HRV-25 for Human rhinovirus 25. The main concept is the organism Human rhinovirus serotype 25 without any clinical attributes such as detection or infection. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The HRV-25 designation uniquely identifies serotype 25, making SCTID 25070008 the precise target. The contextual prefix ‘Organism:’ does not introduce a different clinical concept; it merely indicates the category of the named entity. Thus, the organism concept Human rhinovirus 25 is the correct selection."
2056002,Thunnus atlanticus (organism),Common name recorded: blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus),"The entry pairs the common name with the scientific name, both denoting the same species. SNOMED CT classifies Thunnus atlanticus under Organism, SCTID 2056002. No additional attributes are present. A parent concept such as Thunnus or generic ‘tuna’ is too broad, while sibling species are different taxa, so the species-level code 2056002 is appropriate."
261350001,Tru-cut needle (physical object),Order specifies a Tru-cut needle,"The device requested is explicitly a Tru-cut needle. Category: Physical object. The ordering context does not add attributes such as size or procedure, and the named device is more specific than generic needle. It does not imply other needle types. Hence, the correct SNOMED CT concept is Tru-cut needle (261350001), not a parent or sibling device."
1365814004,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror of right buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Image acquired: intraoral mirror photograph of right buccal segment, teeth in centric occlusion.","The statement details a photographic intraoral image captured via mirror of the right buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion, which is a Record artifact. SNOMED CT code 1365814004 is the most precise match due to the explicit mirror view, right buccal location, and occlusal state. Broader parents lacking these qualifiers are less appropriate, and siblings with different segment laterality or non-occlusal conditions would be incorrect. The phrase “image acquired” is contextual but the artifact content is unchanged."
1287690002,Excision of synovium of toe (procedure),Clinic documentation: toe synovium excision,"This clinic note records excision of the synovium in a toe, equivalent to toe synovectomy. The main concept is a Procedure with defined site and action, and it avoids additional qualifiers such as laterality, approach, or indication. The precise SNOMED CT code is “Excision of synovium of toe (procedure)” (1287690002). Broader synovectomy concepts lack site specificity, and more detailed children/siblings (e.g., synovectomy of the second toe or arthroscopic toe synovectomy) would be inappropriate given the general wording."
404219006,Failed obstetrical version (situation),Patient reports obstetrical version was not successful,"A patient-reported phrasing that the obstetrical version was not successful conveys the failed outcome of the attempt. This is a Situation concept in SNOMED CT. It is the most accurate match to 'Failed obstetrical version (situation)', with 'not successful' being a clinically equivalent synonym for 'failed', and no additional attributes introduced. More specific techniques or timing are not stated, so child concepts tied to a particular method would be less appropriate."
303343000,French gauge (qualifier value),Apply French gauge scale,"This phrasing indicates use of the French gauge scale for measurement, without any numeric value or object being measured. It denotes the unit system itself and is categorized as a Qualifier value. The correct SNOMED CT concept is French gauge (303343000). A parent concept like 'measurement scale' is too broad, and numeric French children are not applicable. Sibling gauge scales are not implied or appropriate."
80519002,"Hospital furniture, device (physical object)",Hospital furniture piece (physical object),"The concept is a piece of hospital furniture as a physical object, without specifying a subtype. Category: Physical object. Hospital furniture, device (80519002) is the appropriate code. Selecting a parent like Physical object would omit the furniture class constraint, and choosing a child (e.g., bedside cabinet) would require detail that is not stated. The synonym “piece” maintains equivalence without added attributes."
16212331000119108,Autoclave ampule submitted as specimen (specimen),Specimen description—autoclave ampoule,"This entry provides a specimen description indicating an autoclave ampoule, directly aligning with SCTID 16212331000119108. The main concept remains strictly the specimen identity; no test names, results, or other attributes are given. The SNOMED category is Specimen. More general or more specific variant concepts would miscode the entry, so this is the correct precise match. The ampoule spelling variant is clinically equivalent to ampule."
766922003,Product containing fluorinated corticosteroid (product),Dispensed product: fluorinated corticosteroid-containing drug,"This entry references a dispensed drug product and specifies it contains a fluorinated corticosteroid, which corresponds to Product concept 766922003. It avoids introducing dose, route, form, or a specific drug name, so child clinical drug concepts are not appropriate. Broader corticosteroid product concepts without fluorination would not match the explicit descriptor used."
115616005,Carbophenothion (substance),Carbophenothion (also known as Trithion),"This entry names carbophenothion and includes the recognized synonym ‘Trithion,’ which is commonly used for the same chemical; the pairing ensures the identity remains the specific substance. No clinical attributes are introduced. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is Carbophenothion (substance), SCTID 115616005, in the Substance category. Coding to a product concept or different chemical would be less precise because the synonym refers to this exact compound."
16466241000119109,History of eyelid surgery (situation),Documented prior eyelid surgery,"The focus is on documented history of eyelid surgery, indicating past occurrence without type, laterality, or indication details. This maps to the SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context concept 'History of eyelid surgery (situation).' Selecting a broader parent like 'History of surgery' would lose eyelid specificity, and child concepts tied to particular eyelid procedures would add granularity not stated. The phrasing is a direct synonym for 'history of eyelid surgery.'"
768632002,Product containing guanylate cyclase 2C agonist (product),Pharmacy stock: GC-C agonist drug product,"Inventory context still references a drug product whose pharmacologic class is GC-C (guanylate cyclase 2C) agonism. That is a product concept in SNOMED CT, aligning with the Pharmaceutical / biologic product category and SCTID 768632002. The GC-C specificity excludes parent/sibling classes, and no particular drug name narrows it to a child. Context of 'pharmacy stock' does not introduce attributes altering the code."
73494004,Electron beam (physical force),Electron-beam,"This hyphenated form is a common orthographic variant for the same physical agent, referring to a beam comprised of electrons. The main concept remains the physical force without any additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force and SCTID 73494004 is the most precise match. Parent concepts are overly broad, while device or procedure-related children are not indicated. The hyphen does not change meaning and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
313334002,Blood sample taken (situation),Chart entry: blood sample taken,"This entry specifies that the chart contains an entry indicating a blood sample was taken, without suggesting method, site, timing, or reason. The main concept is the situational state of blood sample collection. It belongs to the Situation category and maps most precisely to “Blood sample taken (situation)” SCTID 313334002. The chart context does not alter the clinical meaning. Parent concepts would be overly broad, child concepts would add route-specific details not present, and sibling procedural codes would represent the act of collection rather than the situation asserted here."
733816007,Decreased withdrawn behavior (finding),Appears less withdrawn,"An observational statement indicating that the patient appears less withdrawn captures the Clinical finding of decreased withdrawn behavior, aligning with SNOMED CT 733816007. The term 'appears' reflects clinician observation without adding other attributes. Parent concepts lack the decrease, and siblings like 'better eye contact' or 'more engagement' are different findings. 'Less withdrawn' is a direct synonym for 'decreased withdrawn behavior' and maintains precise mapping to this code."
441480003,Primary care department (environment),Location: primary care department,"The entry indicates the environment by labeling it as a location and naming the primary care department. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The precise code is 441480003 since it denotes a department where primary care is provided. Parent concepts are too broad, while siblings such as “Primary care clinic” or “Outpatient department” would misrepresent the organizational structure. The wording remains synonymous with the preferred term."
440675009,Specimen from upper urinary tract obtained by lavage (specimen),Chart entry—specimen type: upper urinary tract washing,"The chart entry names the specimen type and uses “washing,” clinically synonymous with lavage, while specifying the upper urinary tract site. This matches SNOMED CT 440675009 in the Specimen hierarchy. More generic parents omit either the upper-site qualifier or the lavage method, and more specific children would add sub-site details (renal pelvis or ureter) not present. The documentation context does not change the underlying specimen concept."
1300220004,Shockwave (physical force),Shockwave noted by clinician,"The clinician notes the term 'shockwave', indicating acknowledgment of the physical force without specifying event or therapeutic application. The main concept is the shockwave as a force. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. The best match is Shockwave (physical force), not parent 'Physical force' or any sibling/child concepts that add attributes like origin or medical use."
416251000,Feature of circulating blood (observable entity),Follow-up discussion: feature of circulating blood,"In a follow-up context, the entry still references a generic feature of blood that is circulating, and it does not specify which feature or any findings. The main concept is an observable attribute of circulating blood in vivo. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SNOMED CT 416251000 is appropriate because it represents the nonspecific observable tied to circulating blood. Parent concepts are too broad and child/sibling concepts (e.g., a particular analyte or arterial/venous subtype) are too specific for this wording. The phrase “Follow-up discussion” is contextual and does not alter the observable entity being documented."
702201007,Injectable scalp conditioning solution (physical object),Kit component: scalp conditioner (injectable solution),"The entry denotes a kit component that is a scalp conditioner in solution form intended for injection. Category: Physical object. SCTID 702201007 best fits this description since it names an injectable scalp conditioning solution as an object. Parent concepts like 'kit component' or 'conditioner' would be overly broad, and siblings like 'topical conditioner' would differ in route. The synonym 'scalp conditioner (injectable solution)' is clinically equivalent and keeps the same code."
256562002,Cotton wool (physical object),Cotton wool at bedside,"This indicates that the physical object cotton wool is at the bedside. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object; Cotton wool (256562002) exactly matches the object referenced. The entry does not specify roll, ball, pad, swab, or sterile status, thus avoiding misclassification to narrower device concepts. It clearly does not describe a clinical finding."
34141000087102,Specimen from lymph node obtained by endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (specimen),Patient-stated: They took a lymph node sample through the airway using an ultrasound scope and a fine needle,"In lay terms, this entry conveys a lymph node specimen obtained transbronchially ('through the airway') under endobronchial ultrasound guidance ('ultrasound scope') using fine needle aspiration. The concept is a Specimen and corresponds to SCTID 34141000087102. Parent concepts omitting technique or siblings changing guidance/site would be inaccurate. The paraphrase retains the essential attributes (source and method) and remains semantically equivalent to the clinical term without adding extra details."
725870000,Diagnostic coronary angiography report (record artifact),Diagnostic coronary angiography procedure report (document),"This entry explicitly describes the document that is the procedure report for a diagnostic coronary angiography. The concept is the record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 725870000 is appropriate because it is the report arising from the diagnostic coronary angiographic procedure. It should not be coded to the procedure itself. The inclusion of '(document)' clarifies artifact status and does not introduce new attributes, avoiding broader 'cardiac catheterization report' or interventional report siblings."
1264260001,History of treatment of root canal of tooth (situation),History of treated root canal,"“Treated root canal” indicates that the root canal procedure has been performed previously, making this a history-of-treatment statement. It is a Situation with explicit context and not a current procedure or problem. The entry does not include tooth identification, complications, or retreatment. A general history code is less specific, while a procedure code would misrepresent the context. This wording is a safe synonym that keeps the selection at SNOMED CT 1264260001."
328673007,Gluten-free fiber bread (product),Diet order: gluten-free fiber bread,"In a clinician diet order context, the item requested is precisely a gluten-free fiber bread. The concept referenced is a Product. The action context does not change the coded item; the product itself is 'Gluten-free fiber bread' (328673007). Alternative mappings to procedure or generic diet orders would be less appropriate because the text clearly names a specific product. It includes both key attributes (gluten-free and fiber bread) without adding others."
217949003,Accident caused by drilling shaft lift (event),Accident with drilling shaft lift equipment,"The phrase indicates an accident associated with drilling shaft lift equipment as the causal agent, which matches 'Accident caused by drilling shaft lift (event)' (SCTID 217949003) in the Event hierarchy. It does not mention injuries, intent beyond accident, location, or other attributes. Parent concepts covering generic equipment are too broad, and siblings naming other equipment types would be inaccurate. The wording 'with ... equipment' is a colloquial causal paraphrase that maintains the same concept."
285715007,Freezing temperature (physical force),Scene temperature: freezing,"This denotes the temperature at a scene being at the freezing level, which represents the physical force of freezing temperature. Category: Physical force. The context does not add attributes like duration or severity, and it remains distinct from broader 'cold' or event-type 'exposure'. SCTID 285715007 is the precise match."
118368007,Quasi-continuous wave laser beam (physical force),Quasi-continuous wave laser light beam,"The term 'laser light beam' is a clinically safe synonym for laser optical radiation, and the qualifier 'quasi-continuous wave' specifies the emission mode. This is a Physical force and corresponds to SCTID 118368007. The entry avoids procedural, exposure, or injury contexts and does not add technical attributes. Parents and siblings are less precise or incorrect in emission mode, so the quasi-CW specification ensures accurate coding."
444677008,Report type (record artifact),Report type (metadata),"The entry explicitly identifies the metadata element that records the type of a report, precisely corresponding to SNOMED CT’s “Report type (record artifact)” (SCTID 444677008). The category is Record artifact, as this is an informational field within documentation rather than a clinical event or observable finding. It is more specific than broader artifacts like “Report” and avoids implicating child/sibling concepts such as particular report subtypes or other metadata (e.g., report status). The parent concept would be too broad; specific report types would be too narrow. Adding “(metadata)” clarifies context without altering the underlying concept."
129088006,Ventricular effective refractory period (observable entity),Effective refractory period of ventricular tissue,"The entry describes the effective refractory period and specifies the tissue as ventricular, which is the same observable parameter as ventricular ERP. It is an Observable entity and best fits SCTID 129088006. Parent concepts without ventricular specification are less precise; child concepts that specify right or left ventricle are not indicated; sibling concepts like atrial tissue ERP are anatomically incorrect for this wording. The phrasing is a safe synonym that preserves the intended meaning."
75414001,Construction site (environment),Clinician notes: construction site,"This clinician documentation labels the environment as a construction site without attaching incident details. The main concept is an environmental setting. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 75414001 is the correct code, as the phrase does not suggest a broader or more specific location. It avoids new attributes like cause, severity, timing, or occupational role."
1287967009,Volcanic lightning (event),Volcanic lightning referenced,"The term “volcanic lightning” is the event, while “referenced” is documentation context that doesn’t add attributes like exposure or injury. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Event, with the exact concept Volcanic lightning (event) [1287967009]. Using a broader lightning code would miss the volcanic specificity; selecting a volcano-only event would omit the lightning. Therefore, the volcanic lightning event code is the most precise match."
1367753004,Safranin stain technique (qualifier value),Safranin stain approach,"The entry uses 'approach' to refer to the staining technique with safranin, which fits the SNOMED CT qualifier value 1367753004. Category: Qualifier value. No extra attributes such as target tissue or counterstain role are introduced. A generic staining approach would be too broad, and naming other stains would miscode. The paraphrase stays within the scope of a technique qualifier."
79993009,Government hospital (environment),Government-owned hospital,"The phrase indicates ownership by a governmental body, which is the key distinguishing attribute of a Government hospital (environment). SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It is more precise than the generic Hospital (environment) and does not introduce unrelated qualifiers like private ownership or specialized military/veteran status. The synonym is clinically equivalent, so 79993009 is appropriate."
707317007,No hyperkeratosis (situation),Findings: no signs of hyperkeratosis,"This phrasing captures the absence of signs of hyperkeratosis in clinical findings, without specifying location or other attributes. The correct category is Situation and the concept is “No hyperkeratosis (situation)” SCTID 707317007. Any concept indicating presence, or adding site/time/severity detail, would be less suitable than this general absence statement."
309508006,Soft tissue lesion fine needle aspirate specimen (specimen),Diagnostic sample: fine needle aspirate from soft tissue lesion,"The entry identifies a diagnostic sample (i.e., specimen) obtained by fine needle aspiration from a soft tissue lesion. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 309508006 precisely reflects this source-method pairing. Parent or broader concepts omit either the lesion source or the aspirate method; siblings such as biopsy samples or mass-based specimens would misrepresent the method or source terminology. “Sample” is equivalent to “specimen,” and the phrase does not add extraneous attributes."
411399003,Product containing thiourea (product),Manufactured product containing thiourea,"By stating 'manufactured product containing thiourea', the entry identifies a product entity whose formulation includes thiourea, aligning exactly with 'Product containing thiourea (product)'. It introduces no extra clinical attributes such as purpose, dosage, or route. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Any parent product concept lacks the specificity of the ingredient, while child concepts for specific dose forms or brands would be too narrow. It is distinct from the substance concept because it refers to a product containing the substance."
258723000,attomole (qualifier value),Lab unit field: attomole,"Main concept: the laboratory unit field specifies 'attomole'. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It directly references the unit, not a concentration or a different submultiple. Thus, SNOMED 258723000 is the most precise match, and broader or sibling units would be less accurate for this wording."
223558001,Republic of Guinea (geographic location),Patient-reported location: Republic of Guinea,"Within patient-reported context, the named location is Republic of Guinea, mapping to SCTID 223558001. The main concept remains the geographic country and no additional clinical attributes such as timing or severity are conveyed. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. It avoids mapping to parent regions, sibling countries, or child localities. The wording is a context-focused paraphrase that is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
773472000,Product containing cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor (product),Med list: product containing CYP2D6 inhibitor,"This entry denotes a medication list item that is a product containing a CYP2D6 inhibitor. The 'Med list:' context does not change the underlying concept, which is a Pharmaceutical/biologic product mapped to SNOMED CT 773472000. There is no naming of a particular drug, dose, or route, so child concepts are excluded. Parent concepts specifying broader enzyme inhibition are too general, and other CYP inhibitor siblings are incorrect. The phrasing emphasizes a product, distinguishing it from substance role terms."
463574005,Radiographic stretcher (physical object),Radiographic stretcher,"The entry explicitly names a radiographic stretcher, which is a physical object designed for use with X‑ray imaging. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This matches SNOMED CT concept 463574005 most precisely because it denotes the specific stretcher intended for radiography, not a generic stretcher or other imaging furniture. Parent concepts like Stretcher (physical object) would be too broad, and siblings such as radiographic tables or X‑ray trolleys are different equipment. No additional attributes (e.g., timing, cause, severity) are introduced."
432909005,Aspirin given (situation),Patient report: I was given aspirin,"This is a patient-reported statement that aspirin was given, without specifying dose, route, timing, or reason. The main concept remains administration of aspirin, categorized as a Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT 432909005 'Aspirin given (situation)' fits best because it represents the administration event tied to aspirin. Parent concepts would be overly general, and child/sibling concepts with specificity (e.g., dosing, route, or self-administration) are not indicated here. The patient-reported phrasing does not change the clinical meaning and remains equivalent to 'aspirin given.'"
271515009,Iliac crest bone marrow specimen (specimen),Accessioned specimen: iliac crest bone marrow,"This documents an accessioned specimen of bone marrow from the iliac crest, fitting the SNOMED CT Specimen concept SCTID 271515009. Accessioning context does not modify clinical attributes. The entry does not include laterality or aspirate/biopsy details, so it should not map to more specific sibling/child codes, and it is more precise than a non-site-specific parent."
430730004,Family history of mitral valve regurgitation (situation),Family history of mitral incompetence.,"The term 'mitral incompetence' is a clinically accepted synonym for mitral valve regurgitation, here placed in a family history context. The main concept is family history regarding MR. SNOMED CT category: Situation. Because the wording is synonymous with MR and maintains the family history context, SCTID 430730004 is the exact match. Using a parent like family history of heart disease would not capture the specific valve lesion, and coding the disorder MR would incorrectly apply to the patient."
223748002,Sumba (geographic location),Pulau Sumba,"“Pulau Sumba” is the Indonesian-language synonym for “Sumba Island,” directly denoting the same geographic location without introducing additional attributes. The concept falls under Location in SNOMED CT, and the precise code is Sumba (geographic location), SCTID 223748002. Using a language variant does not change the concept; broader parents (e.g., Geographic location) are less specific, and children or siblings (e.g., West Sumba, East Sumba, or neighboring islands) do not fit because no subregion or alternative island is specified."
772158005,Viral hemorrhagic fever suspected (situation),Possible viral hemorrhagic fever (suspected),"The wording 'possible' combined with '(suspected)' conveys uncertainty consistent with clinical suspicion of VHF, without adding details such as causative virus or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, mapping to Viral hemorrhagic fever suspected (situation) [772158005]. It is not appropriate to select the confirmed disorder concept or any specific VHF subtype. The synonym 'possible' is commonly used to denote suspicion and does not change the code selection."
1306653007,Photographic extraoral image of inferior view of face (record artifact),"Extraoral photographic capture: face, inferior view","The text identifies a photographic capture (image) taken extraorally of the face, specifying the inferior view. This is a record artifact rather than a clinical observation or procedure. SCTID 1306653007 best fits because it codes a photographic extraoral image of the inferior view of the face. A general extraoral face photo (parent) lacks the view specificity, and sibling concepts for other views (frontal, profile) or intraoral images would not match. The wording remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
256177001,Isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate (substance),4-methoxycinnamic acid isoamyl ester,"Using '4-methoxy' as an explicit positional descriptor for 'para' and identifying the isoamyl ester maintains equivalence to isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 256177001 is the precise match because it represents this specific ester with the isoamyl group. Generalized parent concepts (e.g., methoxycinnamic acid esters) lack specificity, and other esters with different alcohols are siblings. No dose, route, or clinical event is stated, so the coding remains strictly at the substance level."
125781000119108,History of febrile urinary tract infection (situation),Chart lists history of febrile UTI,"The chart notation indicates a historical condition, and “febrile UTI” conveys UTI with fever. This fits the Situation category and corresponds directly to SCTID 125781000119108. Using a generic history of UTI would be less specific, and a disorder code would imply active disease, which is not stated. The entry does not mention subtypes or added attributes, ensuring precise mapping to the given concept."
215893003,Aircraft collision-landing - parachutist injured (event),Landing-phase aircraft collision resulting in injury to a parachutist,The entry specifies the landing phase of an aircraft collision and that a parachutist was injured. Main concept: aircraft landing collision injuring parachutist (event). SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 215893003 is the exact match as it encodes both phase and injured party. Parent/sibling concepts lacking either component or focused on different scenarios would be inappropriate. The phrase is semantically equivalent and introduces no new attributes.
472957007,History of pain of multiple joints (situation),Clinical history: previous multiple joint pain.,"In reporting contexts, 'Clinical history: previous ...' denotes a past condition; 'multiple joint pain' identifies polyarthralgia. This is a Situation due to the past temporal context. SCTID 472957007 best fits, encoding a history of multi-joint pain. Broader history concepts would fail to capture the multi-joint specificity, and siblings specifying particular joints would not reflect the concept. The finding concept for polyarthralgia would misrepresent the documented historical status."
49950003,Meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion (observable entity),Gastric acid secretion triggered by a meal,"The entry states a meal as the trigger for gastric acid secretion, clearly identifying the stimulus. As an Observable entity, it aligns with SCTID 49950003. It is more specific than general secretion and does not indicate basal or pharmacologic stimulation, nor diagnostic conclusions."
217247009,Burning caused by conflagration in camping place (event),History note: burned when a conflagration occurred at the campsite,"This history entry links the burn to a conflagration at a campsite, i.e., a camping place. The main concept captured is the external cause event of burning due to a large uncontrolled fire in a camping setting. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 217247009 is the most precise code because it includes both cause and location. A broader parent omits the location detail, and siblings specifying different settings would be inaccurate. No additional attributes (severity, timing beyond the event) are introduced."
1365817006,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror and corrected of right buccal segment with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Clinical documentation: mirror-corrected intraoral image—right buccal segment—teeth in centric occlusion.,"This clinical documentation entry presents a photographic intraoral image that is mirror-corrected, focused on the right buccal segment, with teeth in centric occlusion. It is a Record artifact and directly corresponds to SCTID 1365817006. Parent concepts would be insufficiently detailed, and sibling concepts indicating different segments or occlusal states would be inconsistent with the content. The formatting with dashes is stylistic and preserves all necessary attributes without adding new ones."
608031000005108,Partner has harmful pattern of substance use (situation),Health behavior context: partner has harmful pattern of substance use.,"This contextualized entry continues to state that the partner is the subject and they have a harmful pattern of substance use. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. The wording aligns precisely with the concept, avoiding substance-specific detail or additional attributes such as severity beyond ‘harmful,’ timing, or consequences. Hence, the exact situation concept is the most appropriate, rather than broader or narrower related concepts."
720806007,"Ear, nose and throat foreign body extractor (physical object)",ENT foreign body extractor present at bedside,"This indicates the presence of the ENT foreign body extractor at bedside, retaining focus on the physical object and avoiding attributes such as subsite, instrument type, or material. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 720806007 maps precisely. Broader device concepts lacking ENT focus are too general, while narrower devices restricted to one ENT subsite or particular designs are not indicated. The location context does not change the identity of the device."
224644000,Semi-detached house (environment),Semi-detached home,"The phrase identifies the same environment type as the preferred term, using 'home' as a clinically equivalent synonym for 'house' in this context. The concept category is Environment. SCTID 224644000 best matches because 'semi-detached' singles out the specific dwelling subtype. Broader parent concepts like 'home' or 'house' are less precise, and alternatives like 'detached house' or 'townhouse' would not fit the wording. The synonym does not add attributes; it maintains the same meaning and scope."
462474004,Arthroscopic shaver/electrosurgical diathermy system generator (physical object),Documentation line: arthroscopic shaver/electrosurgical diathermy system power generator,"This documentation line names the power generator that serves both an arthroscopic shaver and an electrosurgical diathermy system, a device categorized as a Physical object. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is 462474004. Parent concepts limited to electrosurgical generators or generic arthroscopy equipment are too broad, and siblings limited to shaver devices or ESU-only generators are incomplete. 'Power generator' is a clinically equivalent synonym for the generator unit and does not change code selection."
8680006,Echinorhynchus lageniformis (organism),E. lageniformis (Echinorhynchus),"This uses a standard abbreviation for the species epithet with the genus clarified, referring specifically to Echinorhynchus lageniformis and no other organism. It belongs in the Organism category and maps precisely to SCTID 8680006. A genus-level parent or other species under Echinorhynchus would be less accurate. Because the text is purely nominal, it should not be mapped to a disorder or presence finding."
447293001,Family Cardinalidae (organism),Cardinalidae,"Using the Latin taxon name alone denotes the same family-level organism concept. In SNOMED CT, this maps to Family Cardinalidae (SCTID 447293001). The term does not imply a genus or species and avoids adding attributes like geographic location or clinical relevance. Parent levels (e.g., birds in general) are too broad, and child or sibling taxa (e.g., Cardinalis cardinalis or Thraupidae) would be too narrow or different. Thus, the precise match is the family-level organism concept."
140491000119105,History of transitional cell carcinoma of kidney (situation),Patient reports prior transitional cell carcinoma in the kidney,"The patient-reported context still indicates a personal past history and identifies transitional cell carcinoma at the kidney site, without any additional qualifiers. This is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 140491000119105 fits exactly, reflecting 'history of' and the TCC histology at the kidney. More general history of kidney cancer would be too broad, and sibling concepts for other urothelial locations or current disorders would misrepresent the explicit historical context."
253730009,Balanced coronary system (finding),Codominant RCA/LCx,"The entry states codominance of the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery, which is equivalent to a balanced coronary system. This is a Clinical finding and matches SCTID 253730009. Mentioning RCA and LCx clarifies the codominant relationship without adding new attributes like severity or timing. Parent categories like “coronary dominance (finding)” are less specific, and sibling concepts (right-dominant, left-dominant) are contradicted by “codominant,” ensuring the balanced coronary system is the most precise code."
217946005,Accident caused by land bore or drill (event),Accident involving land-based boring machine,"Here, the event is an accident, and the cause is a land-based boring machine, which is a synonym for a land bore or drill. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the best fit is SCTID 217946005. Using a generic accident or machinery-related parent would be less specific, and selecting a sibling like a handheld drill accident would be inaccurate because this refers to a large land-based boring device. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent and does not change the code selection."
274402003,Cervical smear: action (situation),Papanicolaou cervical smear—action,"This entry specifies the action term and uses a clinically equivalent synonym—Papanicolaou cervical smear—to denote the cervical smear action, without implying screening, test results, or timing. It is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 274402003 is the most precise match since the focus is the action itself, not the procedure performance. Procedure concepts such as “Papanicolaou smear (procedure)” would over-specify by implying a clinical event. The synonym does not introduce new attributes; it merely reflects standard naming of the cervical smear action."
728738009,Entire base of phalanx of finger (body structure),Whole base of a finger phalanx,"This phrase identifies the whole (entire) base of a phalanx in a finger, focusing solely on the complete basal segment of that bone and not introducing any attributes like laterality or specific finger. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. 'Whole' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'entire,' so the concept maps to SCTID 728738009. It is more precise than the parent 'base of phalanx of finger' by clearly indicating the entire base, and it avoids child concepts that specify proximal, middle, or distal phalanx by remaining generic to any finger phalanx."
118360000,Near infrared region laser beam (physical force),Laser beam in the near infrared region,"This entry specifies a laser beam and constrains it to the near infrared region, which corresponds to the concept 118360000. The main concept is a physical force (laser beam) with spectral region defined; no additional attributes (injury, timing, severity, cause) are present. The SNOMED category is Physical force. It is more precise than generic laser beam and does not introduce details that would require a different child or sibling code. The phrasing is a clear paraphrase that remains clinically equivalent."
118366006,Far infrared region laser beam (physical force),Far infrared laser light beam,"“Laser light beam” in the far infrared conveys a laser-generated beam in the far infrared region without any added causal or severity information. The concept is a Physical force. The appropriate code is 118366006 Far infrared region laser beam (physical force). Parent concepts like Laser beam or Infrared region laser beam do not capture the far infrared specificity, and siblings (near/mid infrared) are not applicable. Generic far infrared radiation (non-laser) would be incorrect because the term explicitly indicates a laser beam."
472927003,Contact lens case submitted as specimen (specimen),The sample consists of a contact lens case.,"Stating that the sample consists of a contact lens case directly expresses the specimen identity as the case, which corresponds to 'Contact lens case submitted as specimen'. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This does not add attributes such as contents or contamination. It is more specific than parent device specimen concepts and does not imply the lenses or solution are the specimen, preventing misclassification to sibling concepts."
422412007,Irena puella (organism),Photograph annotation: Irena puella (Asian fairy-bluebird),"The annotation identifies the organism in a photo by both scientific and common names for the same species. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This reinforces species-level specificity, with no attributes that would shift coding to a different concept. SCTID 422412007 is the correct, precise code."
113047000,"Bacterial colony shape, rhizoid (finding)",Rhizoid colony appearance noted,"The phrase conveys the appearance (morphologic shape) of colonies as rhizoid, a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 113047000 represents rhizoid colony shape most precisely. 'Appearance' here functions as a synonym for morphology/shape and does not introduce extraneous attributes. Broader or alternative shape concepts would not fit the rhizoid characterization stated."
690651000119106,History of carcinoma in situ of vulva (situation),History of carcinoma in situ of vulva,"The entry explicitly states a past history of carcinoma in situ at the vulva, without implying current disease or adding attributes such as grade, laterality, treatment, or timing beyond the history context. The main concept is the prior occurrence of vulvar carcinoma in situ. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to Situation with explicit context. The most precise match is “History of carcinoma in situ of vulva (situation)” because the wording indicates historical context of the specific disorder and site. Using the disorder concept “Carcinoma in situ of vulva” would incorrectly imply a current condition, while broader parents like “History of neoplasm of vulva” are too general, and siblings such as “History of malignant neoplasm of vulva” or site/disease variants are not as specific. No synonym variations here change the code selection."
21700006,Free-standing dermatology clinic (environment),Freestanding dermatology clinic,"Using “freestanding” without a hyphen carries the same meaning as “free-standing,” denoting a dermatology clinic not attached to a hospital. This fits the Environment or geographical location concept “Free-standing dermatology clinic” (SCTID 21700006). The parent concept “Dermatology clinic (environment)” is too generic and omits the freestanding characteristic, while siblings like hospital-based dermatology clinics are incorrect. The term does not introduce any new clinical attributes beyond the setting."
223582006,Democratic People's Republic of Korea (geographic location),DPRK (North Korea),"The entry lists the acronym with its common-name expansion, both referring to the same country-level location. The main concept is the national geographic entity. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223582006 fits exactly. Parents such as Korea or Asia are broader than intended, siblings like Republic of Korea represent a different country, and children such as Pyongyang are more specific. The synonym pairing is clinically equivalent and does not shift the concept."
257597006,Desert (environment),Desert,"The single term 'Desert' in environmental context corresponds to the SNOMED concept Desert (environment); it does not specify climate subtype, named geography, or exposure. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. Code 257597006 is appropriate because 'Desert' is a recognized synonym representing the environment type. Parent environment concepts are less precise, and sibling types (e.g., forest, urban) are not indicated."
126067003,Cycloparaffin (substance),Saturated aliphatic cyclic hydrocarbon,"This entry describes a saturated aliphatic cyclic hydrocarbon, i.e., a cycloparaffin. SNOMED CT category: Substance. SCTID 126067003 fits best as it encodes the cycloalkane class. Broader parent concepts do not specify both cyclic structure and saturation, while child concepts represent single molecules within the class. The synonym is chemically and clinically equivalent, and no additional attributes beyond the substance’s defining features are introduced."
701756009,"Polyisoprene surgical glove, non-powdered, antimicrobial (physical object)","Surgical glove—polyisoprene, non-powdered, antimicrobial","By listing the glove type (surgical), material (polyisoprene), powder status (non-powdered), and antimicrobial property, this entry fully expresses the device attributes tied to SNOMED CT 701756009. More general parents lack these specifics, and siblings differing in material (e.g., latex) or powdering would be inappropriate. The dash formatting does not add attributes; it simply enumerates the same required properties, making this an exact match."
410909006,Ketolide (substance),Active ingredient: ketolide,"This entry identifies ketolide as the active ingredient, which is a typical phrasing for a substance. The main concept is the ketolide substance class. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It best matches Ketolide (substance) [410909006] because no specific product or dose is indicated. A parent like macrolide antibiotic would be less precise, and a child such as telithromycin would be overly specific. “Active ingredient” is a clinically equivalent descriptor indicating the substance role without changing the code."
49532004,Great reed warbler (organism),Taxon recorded: Acrocephalus arundinaceus,"This entry uses the scientific name to state the recorded taxon, which is the Great reed warbler, aligning with SCTID: 49532004. The wording adds no clinical or situational attributes; it simply documents the organism’s identity. Category is Organism. Parents like genus Acrocephalus or general Bird are too broad, and siblings (other Acrocephalus species) would not match. The scientific binomial is an exact synonym and maintains precise species-level coding."
266908007,Family history of congenital anomaly of cardiovascular system (situation),Reported family history: congenital cardiovascular malformation,"This documentation note conveys that the patient reports a family history of a congenital malformation of the cardiovascular system. The concept is Situation with explicit context; it does not record a patient disorder. Using “malformation” is clinically synonymous with “anomaly” in the congenital context and does not change code choice. Parent concepts are too general, and child/sibling concepts for heart-only anomalies or “no family history” are inconsistent with the entry. Therefore, SNOMED CT 266908007 is the most accurate match."
26244009,Product containing muscarinic receptor antagonist (product),Prescription written for product containing a muscarinic receptor antagonist,"The prescription description identifies a product whose active pharmacologic class is muscarinic receptor antagonism. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). The precise concept is “Product containing muscarinic receptor antagonist (product)” SCTID 26244009 since no specific ingredient, route, or form is included. Parent concepts are too general, and child concepts such as specific drug products (e.g., atropine-containing product) would be more specific than stated. The wording aligns directly with the target concept."
309283000,Cervical biopsy specimen (specimen),Histology specimen: cervix biopsy,"The entry presents a histology specimen sourced by biopsy from the cervix, aligning precisely with the SNOMED CT Specimen concept “Cervical biopsy specimen” (309283000). Category is Specimen. It refrains from specifying endocervical vs ectocervical or cone techniques, so no child concept is a better fit. It is more specific than generic biopsy specimen parents and distinct from cytology/smear siblings."
401771000,Ostomy adhesive retaining rings (physical object),Stoma barrier ring (adhesive),"This phrasing explicitly indicates an adhesive barrier ring used for stoma care, which is the same device as ostomy adhesive retaining rings. It remains in the Physical object category and maps to SCTID 401771000. It avoids specifying brand or material, and does not drift into related devices like wafers or paste. The parent/sibling concepts are less specific, while this synonym accurately identifies a ring-type barrier."
399043000,Cardiac imaging views (qualifier value),Cardiac imaging view descriptor,"This phrasing indicates a descriptor used to label views in a cardiac imaging context, which is precisely the role of a Qualifier value. It refrains from introducing modality, projection, plane, or named view details, thereby not fitting any child concepts. The explicit cardiac scope makes the generic parent Imaging views too broad. The best match is Cardiac imaging views (399043000)."
217499008,Accident caused by clothes on fire from controlled fire in private dwelling from normal electric fire (event),Incident at patient's home: garments caught fire from standard electric heater; controlled device.,"This entry documents an accidental incident in a private home where garments caught fire from a standard electric heater operating in a controlled manner. The attributes captured are accident, clothing ignition, normal electric fire (expressed as standard electric heater), controlled status, and private dwelling. This is an Event in SNOMED CT, coded as 217499008. Parent concepts lacking the specified source or location are less specific, and sibling concepts such as gas heaters or uncontrolled fires would not fit. ‘Standard electric heater’ is a valid synonym for ‘normal electric fire’ and preserves the concept without adding new details."
122677003,"Specimen from right kidney, inferior pole obtained by partial nephrectomy (specimen)","Right kidney lower pole, partial nephrectomy surgical specimen.","It identifies a surgical specimen from the lower/inferior pole of the right kidney obtained by partial nephrectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The synonym 'lower pole' is equivalent to 'inferior pole.' Parent concepts missing either subsite or method are less specific; sibling concepts involving different laterality or different procedures (e.g., total nephrectomy) would not match."
285720007,Abnormal gravitational force (physical force),Atypical gravitational force,"“Atypical” serves as a synonym for “abnormal” in describing gravitational force, preserving the Physical force category. The entry neither conveys a particular magnitude nor a scenario of use, which keeps it aligned to Abnormal gravitational force (285720007). Parent/sibling concepts (e.g., normal gravitational force) are not supported by this wording, and child concepts are not implicated."
397257003,Fitting point height (observable entity),Vertical height of the fitting point,The entry conveys the same measurement attribute—height along the vertical axis at the fitting point—and does not introduce any extra attributes. It fits the Observable entity category because it is a property to be observed/measured. SCTID 397257003 precisely represents fitting point height. Broader or different parameters like PD or segment height are not appropriate given the explicit fitting point focus. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and maintains code selection.
223752002,Honshu (geographic location),Honshu,"The entry states the place name Honshu, which is the specific Japanese island and geographic location. Main concept: Honshu as a geographic place. No additional attributes (e.g., time, cause, residence) are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223752002 precisely represents Honshu. Using a broader parent like Japan or narrower children such as specific cities or prefectures would be less accurate. The simple place name is a direct, exact match to the concept without altering scope."
411307007,Caine mix III (product),Caine mix 3,"This entry uses Arabic numeral “3” as a clinically acceptable synonym for “III” while preserving the exact identity of the product. The concept type is Product, and SCTID 411307007 Caine mix III (product) is the precise code. The numeral change does not alter meaning or introduce attributes. Broader or different mixes (parents or siblings) would be less accurate, and no formulation, dose, or outcome is mentioned, avoiding mapping to any child variant or to non-product concepts."
314448008,Maximum 24 hour systolic blood pressure (observable entity),Systolic BP maximum for 24 hours,"The entry states the maximum systolic blood pressure for a 24-hour duration, naming the component, extremum, and timeframe—consistent with an Observable entity. The most precise code is Maximum 24 hour systolic blood pressure (314448008). Broader systolic BP observables lack these qualifiers, and alternative statistics or timeframes are sibling concepts. The paraphrase is fully equivalent to the preferred term."
315545003,Born in Trinidad and Tobago (finding),Patient-stated birth location: Trinidad and Tobago,"This entry records the patient’s stated birth location as Trinidad and Tobago, with no further information. The SNOMED category is Clinical finding. The correct mapping is 'Born in Trinidad and Tobago (finding)' SCTID 315545003 since the concept is birthplace at the country level. Parent concepts would be less precise, and child concepts identifying specific locales are not indicated. 'Birth location' is a synonymous way to denote the birthplace finding."
218226008,Accident caused by exposure to noise (event),Assessment: accident due to noise exposure,"In an assessment context, the phrase conveys an accident attributable to noise exposure. Main concept: accident; attribute: cause. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 218226008 is the exact match since it encodes accidents caused by noise. Parent accident concepts miss the causal detail; exposure-only siblings miss the accident. The assessment label is contextual and does not modify the clinical meaning or introduce extra attributes."
16210531000119104,Labia ulcer specimen (specimen),Dermatopathology: labial ulcer specimen,"This conveys a dermatopathology context for a specimen from a labial ulcer, identifying the specimen and its source attributes (labia; ulcer) while avoiding method or test type specifics. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to Labia ulcer specimen SCTID 16210531000119104. The discipline label does not change the underlying specimen concept. Parent concepts (e.g., vulvar lesion specimen) would be overly broad, and child concepts (e.g., labial ulcer biopsy specimen) would add details not present. Siblings lacking the ulcer designation would be less precise."
255472009,Panretinal (qualifier value),Panretinal per imaging annotation,"This ties the qualifier to an imaging annotation context but still only states the qualifier ""panretinal."" No procedure or disease state is added. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The specific code Panretinal (qualifier value) SCTID 255472009 is appropriate because the entry communicates the extent descriptor alone. A more generic extent or different distribution would be less accurate, and the phrase does not imply the procedure concept panretinal photocoagulation."
399698006,"pN category, nasopharynx (observable entity)",Nasopharyngeal pathological N classification,"This entry conveys the pN classification for nasopharyngeal malignancy using 'classification' as a synonym for 'category' without introducing any specific pN grade. The main concept is the TNM pathologic nodal classification for the nasopharynx, categorized as an Observable entity. SCTID 399698006 is the best fit because it represents pN category specific to the nasopharynx. A site-agnostic pN classification would be a parent, specifying pN0–pN3 would imply a child, and cN or other TNM components would be sibling concepts not indicated here."
446774006,Specimen from abscess of brain (specimen),Specimen obtained from a brain abscess,"The entry explicitly states that a specimen was obtained from a brain abscess, focusing on the source rather than a procedure or diagnosis. The main concept is the specimen; no method, severity, or timing is specified. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps most precisely to 'Specimen from abscess of brain' (446774006). Parents like 'Specimen from brain' or 'Specimen from abscess' are too broad. 'Intracranial abscess' as a sibling is broader than brain parenchyma. The phrase does not infer a particular specimen subtype, maintaining alignment with the general concept."
468947004,Electroacoustic transducer (physical object),Electroacoustic transducing device,"This is a near-synonymous phrasing that still denotes a device converting between electrical and acoustic energy. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the best match remains 468947004 (Electroacoustic transducer). The synonym does not introduce directionality or particular application, so it does not suggest a child concept like microphone or speaker, and is more specific than a generic transducer parent."
700397005,Acinetobacter guillouiae (organism),Acinetobacter guillouiae (organism),"This text explicitly labels the item as an organism and provides the exact species name Acinetobacter guillouiae. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The wording does not introduce any clinical context such as presence, site, or disease, so it should code directly to the species-level organism concept, not to a parent genus or to a finding/disorder."
736241001,Pediatric outpatient care plan (record artifact),Pediatric outpatient care plan (record artifact),"The entry mirrors the SNOMED CT preferred term, including the hierarchy designation as a record artifact, making it an exact match for Pediatric outpatient care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736241001. The main concept and attributes—pediatric population and outpatient setting—are fully specified. Category: Record artifact. Broader parents or related siblings (e.g., Pediatric inpatient care plan) are not appropriate given the explicit outpatient qualifier. No additional attributes are introduced."
299280004,Normal passive range of hip adduction (finding),Passive adduction at the hip demonstrates normal range.,"This documentation notes passive testing of hip adduction with a normal range, identifying the modality (passive), joint (hip), movement (adduction), and outcome (normal). It corresponds exactly to the Clinical finding “Normal passive range of hip adduction (finding)” SCTID 299280004. It does not drift into a parent concept of general hip passive ROM and avoids siblings related to active ROM or abnormal findings. The phrase “demonstrates normal range” is a synonymous way to state normal passive range."
866144008,Encounter note (record artifact),Encounter note in medical record,"The entry refers to the encounter note as contained within the medical record, emphasizing its nature as a record artifact. Category: Record artifact. The inclusion of ‘in medical record’ does not change the concept, so Encounter note (866144008) remains the best code. It does not imply any specific subtype (progress, consult) or setting, making parent concepts too broad and child/sibling concepts too specific for this wording."
160303001,Family history of diabetes mellitus (situation),Patient reports diabetes runs in the family,"This patient-reported wording conveys a family history of diabetes mellitus without naming type or specific relatives. It is a Situation concept. SCTID 160303001 is the correct code because it represents a general family history of diabetes mellitus. Using parent categories (family history of disease) loses specificity, while type-specific or relation-specific child/sibling concepts would be inappropriately narrow. The lay phrase 'runs in the family' is clinically equivalent to 'family history of diabetes mellitus.'"
306310006,Referral to upper gastrointestinal surgeon (procedure),Referral order to upper GI surgeon,"The entry reflects an order for a referral to an upper gastrointestinal surgeon, which is aligned with the referral procedure. No additional attributes (reason, timing, urgency) are specified. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 306310006 fits best, as it represents a referral to an upper GI surgeon. Using a more general referral code would omit the specialty; choosing a different GI surgical specialty would not match the upper GI focus described."
309124001,Joint biopsy specimen (specimen),Joint biopsy tissue specimen,"This wording emphasizes that the specimen is tissue obtained via joint biopsy, capturing both the specimen nature and source. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps precisely to Joint biopsy specimen (specimen) SCTID 309124001. Broader parent categories would omit the joint specificity, and siblings like joint fluid specimens would be incorrect because the entry states tissue via biopsy. No additional attributes such as laterality or joint subtype are present, keeping the coding appropriately general to joint biopsy specimen."
1340090000,Structure of extrahepatic segment of left hepatic duct (body structure),Endoscopic visualization site: extrahepatic segment of left hepatic duct,"This endoscopy-related phrasing names the site of visualization as the extrahepatic segment of the left hepatic duct, without adding pathology or procedure details. Category: Body structure. SNOMED CT 1340090000 precisely matches; parent concepts are less specific, and siblings for other duct segments or ducts would misrepresent the left extrahepatic segment stated."
422745008,Product containing peptide hydrolase inhibitor (product),Contains peptide hydrolase inhibitor (product label),"The entry reflects labeling that the product contains a peptide hydrolase inhibitor, directly matching the concept. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (Product). Since it describes the presence of the inhibitor class without specifying which enzyme or clinical use, 422745008 is the correct code. More general parents (enzyme inhibitor-containing product) or narrower children (ACE inhibitor-containing product) would not align with this exact wording."
269673000,Fire on powered aircraft while taking off (event),Incident: fire on powered aircraft during takeoff,"The narrative frames the occurrence as an incident but still specifically identifies a fire on a powered aircraft during takeoff. As an Event, SCTID 269673000 precisely captures the combination of fire, powered aircraft, and takeoff timing. More general event codes lack takeoff specificity, and children focusing on subcomponents (e.g., cabin fire) would be too narrow."
1156683005,Maternal third stage of labor period (qualifier value),Timeframe: maternal third stage of labor period,"Labeling the concept as a 'Timeframe' clarifies its use as a temporal qualifier, specifically the maternal third stage of labor. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 1156683005 is the best fit since it directly encodes the maternal third stage period. General labor period parents or other stage siblings would not match the specificity. The entry avoids adding any event or condition, keeping it strictly a qualifier value."
441662001,Diagnostic imaging department (environment),Radiology department (diagnostic),"‘Radiology department (diagnostic)’ explicitly frames radiology as diagnostic imaging and specifies a department environment. This matches SCTID 441662001 within the Environment hierarchy. Choosing a parent clinical department concept would lose specificity, and selecting children like ‘fluoroscopy suite’ would add modality/technique attributes not present. Sibling concepts defining services or centers are not appropriate because the entry names a department."
184809009,Employment report - no examination (record artifact),Employment letter (report) prepared without examination.,"This describes an employment-oriented communication that functions as a report, with the attribute that no examination occurred. The category is Record artifact, and Employment report - no examination (184809009) best fits. Using 'letter (report)' clarifies that the artifact is a report-type document; this synonym does not introduce new attributes. Parent terms lacking employment specificity or siblings that imply an exam are less accurate."
161584002,History of perinatal cerebral irritability (situation),Parent reports a history of perinatal cerebral irritability,"The concept is the patient’s history of cerebral irritability in the perinatal period, with the information source being the parent. Attributes clearly present are past context and perinatal timing; mentioning the parent as source does not add clinical qualifiers. This is a Situation with explicit context. Code 161584002 is the precise match, as broader history or current irritability concepts would not align. The wording is equivalent to “history of perinatal cerebral irritability,” and the report source does not change code selection."
260039002,Human leukocyte antigen Cw9(w3) (substance),HLA-Cw-9 (W3) antigen substance,"This wording denotes the antigen substance for the HLA-Cw9 (W3) specificity, without implying a test result or patient status. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 260039002 is exact. Parent concepts for HLA antigen or HLA-C antigen are too general. Sibling concepts (other Cw antigens) or antibody substances would be incorrect given the stated antigen specificity."
14354006,Operation on upper respiratory tract (procedure),Upper respiratory tract operation,"The entry names an operation with the anatomical scope explicitly limited to the upper respiratory tract. The main concept is a surgical procedure, and the only attribute stated is the anatomical region (upper respiratory tract). This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Procedure and matches SCTID 14354006 exactly. More general parents like operation on respiratory system are too broad because they include lower tract; children specifying particular substructures (nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx) would be too narrow and are not indicated. Sibling non-surgical or diagnostic procedures are excluded by the word operation, which is clinically equivalent to surgery and keeps the selection at the same code."
251595009,N95 amplitude (observable entity),N95 amplitude result,"The term frames the amplitude of N95 as a result, which still denotes the observable parameter. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The precise code is 251595009 for N95 amplitude. This is not a diagnostic conclusion nor a different metric like latency, ratio, or a different component’s amplitude. Parent concepts (ERG amplitude) are too broad, and siblings (P50 amplitude) do not match. 'Result' is a neutral descriptor for the measured observable."
171229005,Screening plain X-ray of chest (procedure),Screening chest X-ray procedure,"This entry identifies the procedure of a chest X-ray with screening intent, without additional attributes or modifiers, implying standard plain radiography. The main concept is a screening chest X-ray as a procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Code 171229005 is the most precise, as it represents screening plain chest X-ray; parent concepts lacking the screening purpose or siblings indicating diagnostic studies would not fit. The phrase is a clear procedural synonym consistent with the concept."
22478004,Rhodococcus erythropolis (organism),Rhodococcus erythropolis (organism),"By appending '(organism)', the entry explicitly clarifies the category, naming the species Rhodococcus erythropolis without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the exact match is SCTID 22478004. More general parents (genus Rhodococcus or bacterium) are not specific enough, and sibling species would not match the wording. No strain or subspecies is indicated, so no child concept applies. The entry is a clinically equivalent reference to the organism."
55080005,Electromagnetic radiation from radar device (physical force),Radar-derived electromagnetic radiation,"This concise phrase conveys electromagnetic radiation derived from radar, which directly maps to SCTID 55080005 in the Physical force category. Choosing a parent concept like Electromagnetic radiation would omit the radar-specific origin, and selecting exposure or injury concepts would be inappropriate since no event or outcome is described. 'Derived from radar' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'from radar device.'"
8319008,Principal diagnosis (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value),Principal diagnosis recorded,"This phrase indicates that the principal-diagnosis qualifier has been recorded in the documentation. It is a contextual qualifier and maps to SNOMED CT Qualifier value SCTID 8319008. The entry does not add attributes such as timing, severity, or associations. Because it specifies “principal,” it should not be coded to siblings like “Primary diagnosis” or parent generic qualifiers."
468235001,"Angiography contrast medium injection system, line-powered, mobile (physical object)",Cart-based line-powered angiography contrast injector,"This entry specifies a contrast injector for angiography that is cart-based (mobile) and line-powered. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). The explicit modality, function, and attributes uniquely map to Angiography contrast medium injection system, line-powered, mobile. Devices described only as angiography injectors without power/mobility, or battery-powered carts, or fixed wall-mounted injectors would be less accurate."
284250008,Ability to make a fist (observable entity),Functional assessment variable: ability to make a fist,"This entry identifies a functional assessment variable focusing on the capability to make a fist, and does not report a value or introduce new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The contextual descriptor ""functional assessment variable"" does not change the underlying concept, so SCTID 284250008 is appropriate. A parent concept would be too broad, and siblings like hand strength or dexterity represent different observables."
47478002,"Laminectomy for implantation of neurostimulator electrodes, spinal cord (procedure)",Laminectomy and implantation of spinal cord stimulator leads,"This phrase clearly combines the laminectomy with implantation of stimulator leads on the spinal cord, specifying both approach and target. Category: Procedure. It maps to 47478002, which is defined as laminectomy for implantation of neurostimulator electrodes to the spinal cord. Using “leads” for electrodes is clinically equivalent. Broader or different-approach procedures (e.g., percutaneous lead insertion, removal/revision, or generator implantation) are not supported by this wording, making the given concept the most precise match."
736356007,Gynecology inpatient care plan (record artifact),Plan of care — gynecology inpatient,"This indicates a plan-of-care record specific to an inpatient handled by gynecology. Category: Record artifact. 'Plan of care' and 'care plan' are interchangeable in clinical documentation, so this maps accurately to SCTID 736356007. Broader care plan artifacts lack the specialty qualifier, and obstetrics or outpatient variants are not suitable. No additional attributes are present."
118369004,Low energy laser beam (physical force),"Low energy laser beam, per report","This notes the concept as reported, but still only names a low energy laser beam without implying exposure or use. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 118369004 should be selected because it precisely encodes the low energy laser beam. A parent laser beam concept would be less specific, and a high energy sibling would contradict the entry. The phrase “per report” is contextual but does not introduce new clinical attributes."
17630002,Structure of middle rectal plexus (body structure),Middle rectal plexus structure,"The entry denotes the targeted anatomical structure: the middle rectal plexus. No timing, severity, pathology, or laterality attributes are present. In SNOMED CT, this falls under Body structure and is best coded as Structure of middle rectal plexus (17630002). Broader parents (e.g., rectal plexus) or different subdivisions (superior/inferior) would be less accurate. The wording is a semantically equivalent paraphrase that maintains the same concept."
259564000,Low density lipoprotein triglyceride (substance),Patient education note: LDL-associated triglyceride,"This entry references the substance LDL-associated triglyceride in an educational context, still denoting the biochemical entity without asserting a level, test, or condition. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches 'Low density lipoprotein triglyceride (substance)' by specifying triglyceride linked to LDL. A broader parent like 'Triglyceride' would omit the lipoprotein association, and siblings (e.g., HDL-associated triglyceride) would change the lipoprotein. The context does not alter the substance identity, so the substance code remains correct."
42447007,"Intestinal epithelial cell transport of fats, function (observable entity)",Intestinal epithelial cell fat transport—function,"This entry is a stylistic variation that still denotes the function of fat transport in intestinal epithelial cells. The semantic type is Observable entity, aligning with SCTID 42447007. No new attributes (severity, timing, results) are included, and the transported substance remains fats. Parent concepts are overly broad, and child concepts focusing on specific fat species or mechanisms would be too narrow. The dash does not alter clinical meaning, preserving precise mapping."
110519007,Bone structure of shaft of phalanx (body structure),Phalanx bone shaft,"This entry explicitly identifies the bone shaft segment of a phalanx. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to SCTID 110519007 because it isolates the diaphyseal portion without indicating which digit or which phalanx, matching the concept granularity. A parent (whole phalanx bone) is nonspecific to the shaft, while children adding finger/toe or segment detail are not supported by the text. The phrasing is a straightforward, clinically equivalent description of the same anatomical structure."
14601000,Product containing acetylcholine receptor antagonist (product),Cholinergic receptor blocker drug product,"Cholinergic receptor blocker is synonymous with acetylcholine receptor antagonist, so this entry maps to Product containing acetylcholine receptor antagonist. The category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The absence of subtype, route, and indication prevents over-specific mapping to child concepts (e.g., muscarinic blockers) and ensures the correct class-level product code."
161120002,Secondary school (environment),Secondary school physical environment,"Main concept: the physical environment identified is a secondary school. SNOMED CT category: Environment. Adding 'physical' clarifies that this is a location/environment without altering the concept; it continues to map to SCTID 161120002. More general parents and different level siblings are less appropriate. The entry avoids extra attributes such as activities, events, or roles and solely denotes the environment."
177383002,Reconstruction using distant pedicle skin flap (procedure),Reconstruction using distant pedicle skin flap,"The entry explicitly states a reconstructive procedure performed with a pedicled skin flap brought from a distant site. The main concepts are reconstruction (intent), skin flap (tissue type), pedicle (vascular attachment maintained), and distant (nonadjacent donor site). This fits the SNOMED CT category Procedure and precisely matches SCTID 177383002. Broader parents like generic reconstruction procedures or flap procedures without specifying distant pedicled skin would be less precise. Siblings such as local pedicle skin flap reconstruction or free skin flap reconstruction are excluded by the explicit “distant” and “pedicle” wording. No additional attributes (site, laterality, cause) are introduced."
431654006,Genitourinary medicine clinic (environment),Encounter site: genitourinary medicine clinic,"The main concept is the encounter site defined as the genitourinary medicine clinic, which is an environmental location. This fits the SNOMED CT Environment or geographical location hierarchy and matches SCTID 431654006. The 'encounter site' label is contextual and does not introduce a different clinical concept. Parent clinic concepts are too broad, and no sibling specialty is mentioned, supporting selection of the precise GU medicine clinic code."
397297000,Contact lens diameter (observable entity),Contact lens diameter value (unspecified),"The entry denotes the value slot for contact lens diameter, explicitly noting that the numeric value is unspecified, thereby still referencing the parameter rather than a result. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 397297000 is the correct code since it represents the diameter attribute of the lens. Parent concepts such as generic diameter value are not specific to contact lenses, and sibling attributes (base curve, power) are separate lens properties. The term “value (unspecified)” maintains focus on the observable parameter and does not introduce new attributes or alternate concepts."
733475007,Cytologic material from mass of neck obtained by fine needle aspiration (specimen),Cytologic material from neck mass obtained by FNA,"The entry names a specimen consisting of cytologic material sourced from a mass in the neck and explicitly indicates the collection method as fine needle aspiration (FNA). This corresponds to a SNOMED CT Specimen concept. SCTID 733475007 is the most precise match because it encodes cytologic material from a neck mass obtained via FNA, aligning exactly with the site (neck mass), specimen type (cytologic material), and method (FNA). More general parent concepts like generic cytologic material or specimens from the neck without method are less specific, while children or siblings such as specimens from a thyroid nodule or cervical lymph node by FNA would introduce a different anatomical site. The wording does not add attributes like laterality, guidance, or pathology, keeping it uniquely codable to the given concept."
42756003,Premature tooth loss (finding),Tooth lost prematurely,"This entry states that a tooth was lost and that the timing was premature. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 42756003 precisely covers this scenario. Using broader codes like tooth loss would omit the prematurity attribute, and specifying primary/permanent or a cause would move to a child/sibling concept not indicated here. The phrasing is a direct synonym that retains the same clinical meaning and level of specificity."
721913004,Privacy policy acknowledgment of electronic data usage (record artifact),Clinic record: acknowledgment of privacy policy addressing electronic data usage.,"The clinic record notes an acknowledgment of a privacy policy that addresses electronic data usage. This is a documentation artifact and maps to 'Privacy policy acknowledgment of electronic data usage' (SCTID 721913004) in the Record artifact hierarchy. It is not consent, authorization, or refusal. A more general privacy policy acknowledgment without electronic scope would be less accurate. The paraphrase retains the same intent without adding attributes."
278970005,Hepatitis A status (observable entity),Status regarding hepatitis A,"The entry references a status construct for hepatitis A without assigning a value or detailing type (e.g., infection vs immunity). The main concept is the observable item capturing overall hepatitis A status; category: Observable entity. SNOMED 278970005 precisely captures this. More specific children (immune, antibody, infection status) or unrelated siblings (other hepatitis types) would be inappropriate, as the wording stays generic to hepatitis A."
214172005,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision between motor vehicle and pedal cycle, driver of motor vehicle injured (event)",EMS report: motor vehicle traffic collision with pedal cycle; driver injured.,"This EMS entry states a motor vehicle traffic collision with a pedal cycle and explicitly notes the driver is injured, matching SNOMED CT Event SCTID 214172005. The concept requires both the traffic context and the injured-driver role in a motor vehicle–pedal cycle collision. Parent or sibling concepts that omit the role or involve other injured parties are less appropriate. EMS context does not alter the coded concept or introduce extraneous attributes."
28268006,Pregnanediol (substance),Pregnanediol — progesterone-derived diol,"The entry names pregnanediol and describes it as a diol derived from progesterone, which is a clinically accurate descriptor that does not introduce measurement or test attributes. The main concept is the Substance pregnanediol, precisely mapped to SNOMED CT 28268006. More general parent categories (e.g., steroids) are less specific, and sibling/child substances (e.g., pregnanetriol, conjugated forms) are not indicated. The descriptor is a synonym-level explanation and does not change code selection."
428381003,Therapeutic diathermy - action (qualifier value),Treatment modality: diathermy therapy — action,"This entry presents “diathermy therapy” as the treatment modality and labels it as an action, which is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of therapeutic diathermy. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The correct code is 428381003 Therapeutic diathermy - action, since “diathermy therapy” refers to using diathermy for therapeutic purposes as a method. The generic parent “Diathermy - action” is too broad and could include non-therapeutic contexts. No specific technology subtype is mentioned, so it should not map to children like shortwave diathermy. Sibling actions (e.g., thermotherapy not specifically diathermy) are not appropriate because the entry explicitly names diathermy. No additional attributes such as site, dosage, or timing are included, maintaining precise alignment with the action qualifier."
170689008,Injectable phenothiazine stopped (situation),Ceased administration of phenothiazine injections.,"This states that administration of phenothiazine via injections has ceased. It represents a Situation category concept and maps to SCTID 170689008 because it includes the drug class, injectable route, and cessation. Parents like general drug cessation omit key specifics, and siblings specifying other routes or named agents add attributes not present. “Ceased administration” is clinically equivalent to “stopped/discontinued,” with no cause, dose, or temporal qualifiers introduced."
702562003,No evidence of child sexual abuse (situation),No clinical evidence of child sexual abuse.,"This states the absence of clinical evidence for child sexual abuse, which is semantically equivalent to 'no evidence of child sexual abuse' and fits the Situation with explicit context category, mapping to 702562003. It does not claim a history, screening result, or suspected condition; hence, those sibling or related concepts are less accurate. Parent concepts indicating abuse presence are excluded. The qualifier 'clinical' narrows the type of evidence but does not change the code as the core assertion remains the absence of evidence."
225001006,Preoccupied with emotional problems (finding),Preoccupied with emotional problems.,"The entry states the finding of preoccupation with emotional problems without adding timing, cause, severity, or associated conditions. The main concept is a mental content focus on emotional problems. This is a SNOMED CT Clinical finding, not a disorder, capturing an observed or reported mental state. SCTID 225001006 is the most precise match because it explicitly denotes preoccupied with emotional problems. A more general parent like “Preoccupied (finding)” would omit the specific target (emotional problems), and siblings such as preoccupation with health or work do not fit the stated content. The wording uses the preferred term, so there is no change in code selection."
122642003,Specimen from distal ileum obtained by right hemicolectomy (specimen),Accession: distal ileum—right hemicolectomy specimen,An accession-line style entry indicating the specimen source (distal ileum) and collection procedure (right hemicolectomy). The main concept is a specimen within the SNOMED CT Specimen hierarchy. It maps directly to SCTID 122642003 given its specificity. Parent concepts like general ileal specimens and siblings referencing different procurement methods do not match as well. The accession context does not add attributes beyond the required site and method.
1363330002,Structure of nasal quadrant of iridocorneal angle of left eye (body structure),Left eye: nasal quadrant of the anterior chamber angle,"The concept is the nasal quadrant of the anterior chamber angle (synonymous with iridocorneal angle) in the left eye. Category: Body structure. The use of the synonym maintains the same anatomical target. Specificity for quadrant and laterality ensures the exact code. Parent or unspecified angle structures are too general, and sibling quadrants (e.g., temporal) do not match the nasal designation in the wording."
224654001,Bungalow (environment),Housing type: bungalow,"The phrase identifies the housing type as a bungalow, which is a specific environment concept without added attributes. This falls under the Environment or geographical location category, and the exact SNOMED CT code is Bungalow (environment) SCTID 224654001. More general parents like House (environment) would be less precise, and no alternative dwelling type sibling (e.g., Apartment, Cottage) is implied. The qualifier 'housing type' does not alter the meaning; it simply frames the environment classification, keeping the mapping specific to bungalow."
112078008,Appearance young for age (finding),Presents as younger than age.,"The wording conveys that the patient's presentation in terms of appearance is younger than their age, which is synonymous with the target concept. It belongs to Clinical finding. A broader presentation/appearance finding would not capture the 'younger than age' specificity; sibling concepts like 'older than age' do not match. The phrasing remains uniquely codable to 112078008 without adding modifiers."
701308001,Spirometer/pulmonary function analyzer syringe (physical object),Spirometer-PFT analyzer syringe,"Hyphenated wording still denotes the syringe associated with both spirometer and pulmonary function analyzer, identical in meaning to the target concept. No additional attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 701308001 is the accurate selection. Mapping to a generic syringe would lose specificity, and mapping to analyzer devices would be incorrect. The absence of capacity or calibration descriptors precludes choosing a narrower child concept."
411722004,Melanogrammus aeglefinus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Melanogrammus aeglefinus diagnostic allergen solution,"This denotes the same species-specific diagnostic allergen extract and describes it as a solution, which is common phrasing for extracts and remains within the Product concept. It maps to SCTID 411722004. The term “solution” does not specify concentration or route and thus does not create a different child concept. Parent concepts lacking species and therapeutic siblings are less appropriate. The synonym preserves the diagnostic, species-specific product identity."
26916004,"Passive tubular reabsorption, function (observable entity)",Passive renal tubular reabsorption function,"This phrase identifies the same physiologic observable, specifying that the tubular reabsorption is in the kidney (renal) and passive in mechanism. It presents no findings, severity, or procedure-related actions. Category: Observable entity. The SNOMED concept Passive tubular reabsorption, function fits exactly, as adding “renal” is a clinically equivalent clarification rather than a change of scope. A parent like tubular reabsorption function would be too broad (not limited to passive), and a sibling such as active tubular reabsorption function would misrepresent the mechanism. No child concept (e.g., solute-specific passive reabsorption) is implied."
420847003,Metered dose aerosol (qualifier value),Ordered as metered dose aerosol,"This order entry specifies the product’s dose form as a metered dose aerosol, corresponding to a pharmaceutical dose form qualifier. Category: Qualifier value. It avoids route, device, and ingredient details, making siblings (e.g., 'metered dose spray') and device objects ('metered dose inhaler') less appropriate. It precisely fits SCTID 420847003 rather than general parents like 'Aerosol.'"
119261009,Endocrine gland part (body structure),Endocrine gland anatomical part,"The phrase explicitly frames the concept as an anatomical part of an endocrine gland, with no detail on which gland or named element. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 119261009 is the precise match because it codes a generic endocrine gland part. Using the parent concept for the whole endocrine gland would be broader than intended, and selecting child concepts tied to specific glands or named substructures would be too narrow. Adding “anatomical” clarifies the type of concept and remains clinically equivalent to “part.”"
1255263006,Removal of root canal post from tooth (procedure),Operative note: removal of root canal post from tooth.,"Within operative documentation, this line records the procedure of removing a root canal post from a tooth. Category: Procedure. The note context does not change the underlying clinical concept. It remains distinct from related procedures like core removal or retreatment. SNOMED CT 1255263006 is the precise code."
713399000,Knowledge level of travel health (observable entity),Knowledge level of travel health,"The entry states the exact observable being captured: the individual's knowledge level of travel health. No result value, timing, or procedural wording is provided, so this is a pure reference to an Observable entity. In SNOMED CT, this aligns precisely with Knowledge level of travel health (observable entity) (SCTID: 713399000). Choosing parent concepts like generic knowledge level would be less specific, and siblings such as knowledge level of specific travel topics would be overly narrow. The wording matches the preferred term and thus is the most precise code."
302424006,Introduction of inert substance into subcutaneous tissue (procedure),Subcutaneous insertion of inert substance,"The wording conveys insertion (equivalent to introduction) of an inert substance into the subcutaneous tissue, with no added qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 302424006 is the most precise match, as it captures introduction of inert material into the subcutaneous layer, not into dermis or muscle and not involving device implantation or pharmacologic therapy. The synonym 'insertion' does not alter code selection in this context."
78326006,"Conditioning, function (observable entity)",Conditioning function in chart,"This entry indicates that the conditioning function observable entity is noted in documentation, but it does not add attributes such as normality, severity, or subtype. The concept remains the functional capacity to form conditioned responses. It is not a procedure or a result; it is the named observable. Therefore, Conditioning, function (SCTID 78326006) is the correct code. Mapping to a parent mental function would be less specific, and sibling domains (e.g., memory) are not equivalent. The phrase 'in chart' is merely context of documentation and does not change the underlying concept."
286633001,Short wave radiation (physical force),Short wave radiation present,"While 'present' implies acknowledgment in a context, the entry still denotes the physical force itself without specifying exposure, dose, or effect. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and SCTID 286633001 is the precise match. It does not generalize to radiation overall or specify a different band, so parent and sibling concepts would be less accurate."
271930005,Dermatological test interpretation (observable entity),Dermatological test interpretive summary,"An “interpretive summary” describes the evaluative conclusion of a dermatology test and is an Observable entity. The entry does not report results or identify a specific test modality, preventing misclassification to result findings or child concepts like patch test interpretation. Compared to a general parent (test interpretation), this has needed dermatology specificity, so SCTID 271930005 is appropriate."
256997005,B*3902 (substance),B*39:02 HLA-B antigen,"This concise, report-style label identifies the specific HLA-B antigen allele B*39:02, with no additional attributes such as detection or patient status. The SNOMED category is Substance. SCTID 256997005 precisely matches B*3902; using a parent like 'HLA-B antigen' would be nonspecific, and selecting a sibling allele would be inaccurate. The ordering of terms is a synonymous formulation that retains the exact substance identity and thus supports the same code."
62768004,"Latent learning, function (observable entity)",Function of latent learning,"The phrase “Function of latent learning” denotes the same observable cognitive function as the preferred term, merely reversing word order. It remains an Observable entity and maps specifically to SCTID 62768004. Broader concepts like cognitive function or learning function do not specify the latent (unreinforced) aspect, and related concepts such as impaired latent learning or testing procedures would add finding or procedural attributes, which are not present in this neutral functional label."
443684005,Disease outbreak (event),Epidemiology note: disease outbreak,"The phrase frames the event within an epidemiology note, but the medical concept remains simply a disease outbreak, with no added qualifiers such as geographic spread, specific pathogen, or temporal status. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The appropriate code is 443684005 Disease outbreak (event). Parent Event is too vague, and siblings like epidemic/pandemic or facility-specific outbreaks would require details not present."
223965004,Shetland (geographic location),Shetland,"The entry states the geographic location Shetland without any additional qualifiers. The main concept is a place name; no temporal, causal, or clinical attributes are present. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The wording exactly matches Shetland (geographic location), SCTID 223965004, making it the most precise choice. A broader parent like Scotland or United Kingdom would be less specific, and children such as Lerwick or Mainland (Shetland) are too specific and not indicated. Siblings like Orkney or South Shetland Islands would be incorrect. The single term is the canonical form for this concept."
297736006,Gola language (qualifier value),Gola language documented,"This phrase records that the language is Gola language and uses the word “documented” only as context of recording. The main concept is the language Gola; no clinical findings or observable attributes are added. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate selection is the Qualifier value Gola language (297736006). Choosing the parent Language (qualifier value) would be too broad, and other sibling language values would be incorrect. The verb “documented” does not introduce a different concept; it simply contextualizes the same qualifier value."
701338007,Bladder volume ultrasound imaging system (physical object),Follow-up note equipment — bladder volume ultrasound imaging system,"A follow-up note context explicitly identifies equipment, namely a bladder volume ultrasound imaging system. The core concept remains a physical device; no timing, results, or portability attributes are added. This is a Physical object and most precisely matches SCTID 701338007. Broader parents lack the bladder volume specificity, and siblings capturing procedures or device components would not represent the entire imaging system."
773517000,Osteopathic manipulative medicine care plan (record artifact),Problem list item: OMT plan of care,"The entry places an OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) plan of care on the problem list, still referring to a care plan record artifact. The correct SNOMED concept is Osteopathic manipulative medicine care plan (SCTID 773517000). OMT is a clinically accepted synonym for osteopathic manipulative medicine. There are no added attributes like diagnosis details or laterality. A parent care plan artifact would be overly broad, and procedure or order concepts would be incorrect because the entry focuses on the plan document."
443101000124104,Adult dialysis renal specialty formula (product),Adult renal dialysis specialty nutrition formula,"This phrase captures the same clinical product: a specialty nutrition formula for adult dialysis patients with renal needs. It is a Product in SNOMED CT. ‘Nutrition formula’ is a clinically equivalent synonym for ‘specialty formula’ in this context and does not introduce new characteristics. Broader parents (e.g., renal formula not limited to dialysis or adult) are less precise, and pediatric dialysis renal specialty formulas are siblings not matching ‘adult.’ No extra qualifiers such as route, composition, or brand are present. SCTID 443101000124104 is the appropriate code."
284771004,Back yard (environment),Backyard space,"Backyard space refers to the same environmental location as back yard; 'space' is generic and does not add attributes. This matches Back yard (environment) SCTID 284771004 under Environment or geographical location. Parent concepts like outdoor space are broader, and siblings such as front yard or patio do not capture the rear yard specifically, justifying use of this precise code."
736355006,Gynecology urinary bladder training inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient plan of care under gynecology for bladder training,"This entry describes a documented inpatient plan of care managed by gynecology and dedicated to bladder training, which precisely matches SNOMED CT 736355006 (Record artifact). Parent concepts lacking either the specialty or the training focus are overly general, and siblings that represent interventions or non-inpatient plans are not appropriate. The phrasing uses common synonyms without adding extra clinical attributes."
308707006,Certificate (record artifact),Certificate uploaded to EMR,"This indicates a certificate document was uploaded to the electronic medical record. The main concept is a certificate; 'uploaded to EMR' is a workflow detail. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 308707006 is the precise match because it denotes a certificate artifact without specifying type or purpose. Mapping to the parent would be too general, and mapping to specific certificate types would be incorrect due to absent qualifiers. The terminology remains consistent with a generic certificate document."
16209691000119106,Specimen from left lung obtained by blind bronchioloalveolar lavage procedure (specimen),"Patient: ""They did a blind BAL on my left lung and collected a sample.""","A patient-reported statement, but it still unambiguously describes a specimen collected from the left lung via blind bronchoalveolar lavage. The core concept is a Specimen; attributes include left lung source and blind BAL method. This matches the precise SNOMED concept for the specimen and distinctly excludes broader or different siblings like guided BAL or other respiratory samples. Use of 'BAL' is a clinically standard synonym for bronchioloalveolar lavage."
405899007,K-k+ phenotype (finding),Kell typing confirms K-k+,This laboratory phrasing states confirmation of the specific Kell phenotype K−k+. It represents a Clinical finding and maps exactly to K-k+ phenotype (SCTID 405899007). The wording excludes broader parent concepts and alternative sibling phenotypes. The use of ‘confirms’ does not add new attributes beyond the phenotype itself; it simply reiterates the same K−k+ finding.
727702000,Entire neck of middle phalanx of finger (body structure),Entire neck of intermediate phalanx of finger,"“Intermediate phalanx” is a clinically standard synonym for the middle phalanx of the finger; paired with “entire neck,” it denotes the whole neck region of that phalanx. This is a Body structure and maps precisely to SCTID 727702000. A parent concept would not indicate the phalanx level, and a sibling concept dropping the ‘entire’ qualifier would be less accurate. The use of “intermediate” does not change the anatomical target and thus retains the same code."
428242000,Product containing 4-aminobutyrate - 2-oxoglutarate transaminase inhibitor (product),On a product containing GABA transaminase inhibitor,"This patient context entry indicates use of a product containing a GABA transaminase inhibitor, clinically synonymous with 4-aminobutyrate–2-oxoglutarate transaminase inhibitor. The SNOMED category is Product; SCTID 428242000 best represents a medication product at this class level. No dosage, route, brand, or indication attributes are added. A child concept (specific active) would over-specify, and a parent/sibling like ‘GABAergic product’ would be too broad, making the given product-containing class the most accurate code."
255297006,Behavior descriptors (qualifier value),Behavior descriptor category (qualifier value),"The entry explicitly frames behavior descriptors as a category within qualifier values. Main concept: categorical grouping of behavior descriptors for qualification. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It clearly belongs to the behavior descriptors concept, not to behavior findings or disorders. The term avoids pointing to any specific child descriptor, making SCTID 255297006 the precise match."
411783006,Elymus triticoides diagnostic allergen extract (product),Elymus triticoides allergen extract for diagnostic use,"This entry denotes an allergen extract specifically for diagnostic use and names Elymus triticoides, clearly placing it within the diagnostic allergen product category. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It maps precisely to SCTID 411783006 because it includes the species and diagnostic intent, avoiding any additional attributes like dosage form or therapeutic application. Parent concepts lack the species detail, and sibling concepts relate to other species. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
336231005,Intravenous catheter holder (physical object),Intravenous cannula holder,"The term 'cannula' is commonly used interchangeably with 'catheter' in IV therapy contexts, especially for peripheral IVs, and 'holder' denotes the physical object that stabilizes or holds it. The main concept is a device for holding an intravenous cannula, a Physical object, aligning with SCTID 336231005. It remains more specific than a general cannula holder by retaining the intravenous qualifier. It avoids alternate devices like clamps or adhesive dressings and does not add attributes such as subtype, timing, or laterality."
37930007,Neon isotope (substance),Isotope of neon,"This phrase directly denotes an isotopic form of the element neon and does not introduce attributes like mass number, stability, radioactivity, or use. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the most accurate match is Neon isotope (substance), SCTID 37930007, which captures any isotope of neon without further specification. A parent like Neon (substance) lacks the isotopic qualifier and is therefore less precise, while children such as Neon-22 or radioisotopic neon would add details not present in the wording. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
468560000,Diamond dental laboratory bur (physical object),Sterilization pack: diamond dental laboratory bur,"Main concept: a sterilization pack containing a diamond dental lab bur; attributes: diamond material, lab context. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. Mention of 'sterilization pack' is contextual and still refers to the same device, aligning with SCTID 468560000. A generic lab bur or non-lab diamond bur would be less precise. No detailed attributes are specified."
734482001,Structure of vein of right lower limb (body structure),Veins of right lower limb,"The entry explicitly denotes the venous structures located in the right lower limb. The main concept is anatomical veins with the attribute of laterality (right) and regional location (lower limb). The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This matches SCTID 734482001 because it specifies veins (not arteries), the lower limb (not a subregion like leg only), and right laterality. More general parents such as 'vein structure' lack the regional and lateral specificity, while children like specific named veins (e.g., right great saphenous vein) or deep/superficial subsets are more granular than stated. The phrasing is a direct synonym for 'Structure of vein of right lower limb' and does not introduce additional attributes."
81547007,Vacuum (physical force),Diagnostic entry: vacuum (physical force),"Framed as a diagnostic entry, the content remains solely the physical force vacuum, without introducing causation or other modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force; Vacuum (physical force) [81547007] matches directly. A parent concept would be less specific, and sibling forces would be incorrect. The entry does not denote exposure, injury mechanism, or device use, so the force concept is the correct and most precise code."
14971004,Isoleucine (substance),Formulary component: isoleucine,"This indicates that isoleucine is a component listed in a formulary, referencing the substance identity without additional attributes like dose or stereochemistry. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Isoleucine (substance) [14971004] best matches because the entry names the chemical entity directly. Product-level concepts would be incorrect, as no specific product is described. Parent amino acid concepts are too general, and child concepts introducing L- or D- forms are not supported by the wording."
307930005,Death certificate (record artifact),Death certificate included in chart,"This indicates the presence of the death certificate within the chart, focusing on the artifact itself. Inclusion is contextual and does not alter coding, so “Death certificate (record artifact)” SCTID 307930005 is appropriate. It does not fit clinical finding or procedure categories and does not suggest cause-of-death documentation, avoiding misclassification to sibling concepts."
53658005,Cichorium (organism),Cichorium species (unspecified),"The phrase indicates an unspecified species within the genus Cichorium, thus pointing to the genus without naming a specific species. No clinical modifiers are present. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The best match is Cichorium (organism), SCTID 53658005. A parent concept would be insufficiently specific, and a child species code (e.g., Cichorium endivia) would add specificity not stated. ‘Unspecified species’ maintains genus-level coding."
777996001,Alleged being subjected to abuse (situation),Patient described as alleged subject of abuse,"This entry states the patient is characterized as the alleged subject of abuse, which directly corresponds to an allegation without confirmation or subtype detail. It should be coded as the Situation Alleged being subjected to abuse (situation), SCTID 777996001. Alternatives such as “Suspected abuse,” “Victim of abuse,” or type-specific abuse are less suitable because they alter certainty or add attributes not provided. The paraphrase “alleged subject of abuse” is semantically equivalent and preserves the same code."
468081007,Brachytherapy system chair (physical object),Patient seated in the brachytherapy system chair,"The sentence references the specific physical object by name in a clinical context of use (patient seated). Category: Physical object. The usage context does not add attributes to the chair itself; it merely indicates interaction. It remains uniquely tied to the brachytherapy system chair and not to general treatment chairs or other equipment. Therefore, parent concepts (generic chair) and siblings (other brachytherapy furniture) are less accurate. SNOMED CT 468081007 is the correct code."
301131000,Heart murmur absent (situation),No heart murmur,"The entry explicitly documents the absence of a heart murmur, which is a negated cardiac auscultation finding. This aligns with a Situation with explicit context in SNOMED CT, rather than a positive Clinical finding. The most precise match is Heart murmur absent (situation) [301131000], as it encodes the absence of the murmur at the time of assessment. Parent concepts like ‘Heart murmur (finding)’ would be incorrect because they represent presence, and broader siblings like ‘Normal cardiac examination’ add unrelated attributes. The simple negation here does not introduce severity, timing, or etiology, so the situation code is the exact fit."
308621001,RM10-DHSS DMO report (record artifact),RM10 DHSS DMO report (DHSS Departmental Medical Officer),"This entry retains the full identity of the report and clarifies DMO as DHSS Departmental Medical Officer, still denoting the exact RM10-DHSS DMO report artifact. No clinical details or document attributes (e.g., timing, status) are introduced. The precise SNOMED CT code is 308621001 RM10-DHSS DMO report (record artifact), under Record artifact. Parent concepts such as generic reports are too broad, and sibling DHSS report types would be incorrect because RM10 is explicitly named. The clarification is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not change code selection."
285669001,Infrasound waves (physical force),Reported synonym: Subaudible range acoustic waves,"“Subaudible range acoustic waves” is a clinically equivalent synonym for infrasound waves, indicating frequencies below human hearing. “Reported synonym” is documentation context. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. The specificity aligns with Infrasound waves (physical force) [285669001], not with broader acoustic concepts or alternate frequency bands. No extra attributes (e.g., exposure, source) are introduced."
1206000,Product containing alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist (product),Pharmacy dispensed an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist product,"Dispensing language clearly refers to a pharmaceutical product; the product’s defining feature is alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonism. The correct SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product, and SCTID 1206000 is the most specific match. No specific drug name, form, or dose is included, avoiding child-level concepts. Broader parent concepts (e.g., any adrenergic antagonist product) or sibling classes (e.g., alpha-1 antagonists) are less precise than the alpha-2-specific product wording."
469795006,Manual hand pump (physical object),Manual handheld pump,"This denotes a pump that is handheld and manual, i.e., operated by the hand, which is equivalent to manual hand pump. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. Manual hand pump (physical object) SCTID 469795006 is the precise match. A broader pump or manual pump (without hand) could encompass foot-operated types, and specific siblings (electric, vacuum, breast) add attributes not present. 'Handheld' here reinforces hand operation without introducing a different subtype."
1179117001,"Structure of Brodmann area 33, pregenual (body structure)",Parcel name: Brodmann area 33—pregenual,"The main concept is the parcel corresponding to the pregenual subdivision of Brodmann area 33, with no clinical modifiers. This is a Body structure. “Parcel name” is an atlas/parcellation context that does not alter the structure being identified. The pregenual qualifier ensures exact mapping to the intended SNOMED concept; broader BA33 or other Brodmann area parcels would be incorrect."
224867000,Further education college (environment),Place: further education college,"The entry indicates the place type is a further education college, which maps directly to the environment concept. 'Place' is a contextual label and does not introduce new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The best match is Further education college (environment) SCTID 224867000, not broader College (environment) or unrelated educational environments, ensuring specificity to the FE college type."
223579001,Uzbekistan (geographic location),The Republic of Uzbekistan,"Adding the definite article does not change the referent; it remains the same sovereign country. No attributes such as origin, residence, or event location are implied. This maps to Uzbekistan (geographic location), SCTID 223579001. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value (Geographic location). Parent or child geographic entities would be over- or under-specific for the wording used."
74977003,Structure of proximal phalanx of great toe (body structure),Proximal phalanx of first toe,"Referring to the great toe as the 'first toe' (digit 1 of the foot) is a standard anatomical synonym. The phrase pinpoints the proximal phalanx and adds no other attributes. It is a Body structure and maps to 'Structure of proximal phalanx of great toe' (SCTID 74977003). A parent like 'Proximal phalanx of toe' would be too general, and siblings like 'Distal phalanx of first toe' are excluded by the explicit 'proximal' designation."
396007005,Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (substance),Bismuth subcitrate (colloidal form),"This entry clarifies the physical/chemical presentation as 'colloidal form', directly matching colloidal bismuth subcitrate. The concept remains a substance; no administration or brand attributes are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Substance. SCTID 396007005 is the precise code, avoiding broader bismuth categories or different salts. The synonym is an explicit specification of the same entity and does not alter the intended concept."
15338000,Structure of middle lobe branch of right pulmonary artery (body structure),Target vessel: right pulmonary artery branch to the middle lobe,"Although framed in a contextual label, the anatomical entity named is the lobar branch of the right pulmonary artery to the middle lobe, which aligns with SNOMED CT 15338000 (Body structure). No procedural or pathological attributes are asserted; the focus remains the specific lobar branch. This avoids the broader parent vessel, segmental child structures, and sibling lobar branches. The synonymic phrasing stays clinically equivalent and supports precise mapping to 15338000."
394797007,Resource center managed by local authority (environment),Setting: local government–operated resource center,"Main concept: a resource center operated by local government. Attribute: local authority operation; “Setting:” is a contextual label. SNOMED CT category: Environment. “Local government–operated” is synonymous with “managed by local authority,” justifying SCTID 394797007. The parent lacks the management qualifier, and sibling concepts with different managers are not appropriate. No additional properties (e.g., purpose, timing) are introduced."
223592003,Republic of the Philippines (geographic location),Birthplace: Philippines,"Main concept: the person’s birthplace is the Philippines, indicating the country as the location. The attribute ""Birthplace"" provides context without specifying subnational areas. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. This aligns with SCTID 223592003 for the national entity. It avoids mapping to parents like Asia or children like specific provinces/cities. The paraphrase is equivalent, so the code remains the same."
69262000,"Immediate memory, function (observable entity)",Cognitive observable: immediate memory function,"This entry explicitly categorizes immediate memory function as a cognitive observable, which matches the SNOMED CT Observable entity for that function (69262000). No results, severity, or impairment are implied, preventing drift into findings or disorders. It remains specific to 'immediate' and does not introduce a different memory subtype, ensuring this code is more appropriate than parent or sibling concepts."
1380000009,Union for International Cancer Control aM1c(1) (qualifier value),Cancer registry stage (UICC): aM1c(1),"The phrase indicates a registry recording of the UICC autopsy TNM metastasis category aM1c(1). It is a Qualifier value and does not include additional clinical attributes such as site, grade, or therapy. Keeping the 'a' autopsy prefix and '(1)' subdesignation ensures exact alignment with SCTID 1380000009. A parent like 'UICC aM1' or a sibling like 'UICC M1c(1)' without the autopsy prefix would be less accurate than this precise qualifier value."
404619004,"Salmonella IIIa 50:z4,z23,z32:- (organism)","Salmonella IIIa serovar 50:z4,z23,z32:- (organism)","This wording explicitly calls out the organism and its serovar, with antigenic formula 50:z4,z23,z32:-, which is the exact identity of the taxon. No presence, infection, or specimen attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Organism; the exact concept is Salmonella IIIa 50:z4,z23,z32:- (404619004). Parent nodes without this formula are broader, and siblings with different formulas would be incorrect. The terms “serovar” and “organism” are synonymous contextual descriptors, not changing code selection."
160500004,Has stepmother (finding),Step-mom noted.,"“Step-mom” is a common synonym for stepmother and indicates that the relationship has been observed/documented, which aligns with the Clinical finding “Has stepmother (finding)” SCTID 160500004. The colloquial synonym does not add attributes or change meaning. General stepparent concepts would be less specific, and stepfather would be incorrect. Hence, the exact concept and code 160500004 are appropriate."
41079005,Internal blind (qualifier value),Blind internal approach,"This is a word-order variation that still denotes the same qualifier 'internal blind approach'. It falls under the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category and maps to 41079005 Internal blind (qualifier value). The rearrangement does not change meaning; it remains clinically equivalent to 'internal blind'. Parent concepts like 'Internal approach' or 'Blind approach' alone are less accurate, and sibling concepts such as 'External blind approach' differ. Thus, this entry is uniquely codable to the given qualifier."
416868005,Surgical intraoperative record (record artifact),Intraoperative surgical record artifact,"This entry names the artifact type explicitly and constrains it to surgical intraoperative documentation, matching the Record artifact category. SCTID 416868005 is exact because it encodes the artifact generated during surgery in the intraoperative period. A broader artifact (e.g., generic intraoperative artifact) lacks surgical specificity, and siblings such as perioperative or anesthesia artifacts have differing scopes. The explicit use of “record artifact” maintains equivalence and introduces no new attributes."
1303240005,Electronic cigarette liquid (substance),E-cig liquid for electronic cigarettes,"This phrase employs a common shorthand (“E-cig liquid”) and clarifies its association with electronic cigarettes, indicating the substance used in those devices. The main concept is a liquid substance; no attributes like nicotine content, flavor, or specimen status are present. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps best to “Electronic cigarette liquid (substance),” not to broader liquid substances or to device/aerosol siblings. Because composition is unspecified, child concepts denoting specific ingredients are not appropriate."
216942001,Failure of sterile precautions during abdominal paracentesis (event),Documented sterile precautions failure in the course of abdominal paracentesis,"The entry describes a documented failure of sterile precautions and confines it to “in the course of abdominal paracentesis,” indicating the timing and procedure. The main concept remains a procedure-related sterility failure. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 216942001 is the correct code, as it covers failure of sterile precautions specifically during abdominal paracentesis. Generic parent events lack specificity, and sibling concepts for other procedures are inappropriate. There are no added attributes like outcomes or causes, so the mapping is precise."
786047009,Structure of tributary of retinal vein of left eye (body structure),Observation site: left retinal vein tributary,"Even though the entry uses observation context, the named site is a left retinal vein tributary, an anatomical Body structure. It maps best to 'Structure of tributary of retinal vein of left eye' because it designates a venous branch in the left retina without specifying central/peripheral segments or any disease state. A parent 'retinal vein (left)' would not capture the branch detail, and a sibling such as the right eye or central vein tributary would be inconsistent. 'Retinal vein tributary' is a clinically equivalent expression of the same concept."
440545006,Prescription record (record artifact),Prescription record present,"This asserts the existence of a prescription record, clearly identifying the artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It aligns with “Prescription record (record artifact)” because it refers to the documented prescription, not an order or a clinical finding. No additional attributes (e.g., timing, content, format) are introduced, making parent concepts too broad and sibling concepts like medication order inappropriate."
65789000,Genus Ulocladium (organism),Identified genus: Ulocladium,"This statement indicates that the genus-level organism identified is Ulocladium, without naming a species or adding clinical attributes. The main concept is the genus Ulocladium. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, with code Genus Ulocladium (organism), SCTID 65789000. A parent concept like Fungi (organism) would be less precise; any child species would exceed the stated specificity; siblings are other genera. The wording about ‘identified’ is contextual and does not change the mapping to the genus."
718258007,Implantable cardiac device management application software (physical object),Cardiac implantable device management application software,"The wording uses ‘cardiac implantable device’ (a synonym of ‘implantable cardiac device’) and states it is application software for management, which aligns exactly with the concept. Main concept: application software for managing implantable cardiac devices. Category: Physical object. Parent concepts are too generic, while child/sibling terms targeting a single device or hardware programmers would be less fitting. The synonym maintains semantic equivalence without introducing new attributes."
1269402006,Presence of tumor necrosis in malignant neoplasm of kidney in excised kidney specimen (observable entity),"Kidney cancer, resected kidney specimen: tumor necrosis present.","The entry conveys that in a resected (excised) kidney specimen from a kidney cancer (malignant neoplasm of kidney), tumor necrosis is present. The key concept is the presence of tumor necrosis within a malignant renal tumor on an excised kidney specimen. This is an Observable entity suited for pathology reporting. SCTID 1269402006 is ideal because it specifies presence of tumor necrosis for malignant neoplasm of the kidney in an excised specimen. Parent or sibling concepts lacking specimen specificity or indicating absence/extent would misrepresent the statement. The synonyms “kidney cancer” and “resected kidney specimen” are clinically equivalent to malignant neoplasm of kidney and excised kidney specimen, without altering the coded meaning."
288700007,Ability to communicate in different places (observable entity),Capacity to communicate in different settings,"The main concept is the capacity (ability) to communicate, and the attribute clearly specifies different settings (places). This is an Observable entity describing a dimension of functioning across locations. “Capacity” is a clinically safe synonym for “ability,” and “different settings” is equivalent to “different places.” It does not introduce performance level, cause, or timing. A parent concept like general communication ability lacks the locations attribute, and siblings or children specifying particular settings would be less appropriate, so the concept matches precisely."
441611000124109,Hepatic specialty enteral formula (product),Hepatic specialty enteral nutrition product,"This clearly denotes an enteral nutrition product with hepatic specialty, which is the same concept as hepatic specialty enteral formula. The concept type is Product. The precise match is Hepatic specialty enteral formula (product) SCTID 441611000124109. It excludes broader parent categories and does not introduce attributes leading to child or sibling concepts, maintaining exact alignment with the given code."
314641006,No testicular lump present (situation),Patient reports no testicular lump,"The patient report confirms the absence of a testicular lump, maintaining the specific negation without extra qualifiers like laterality or severity. The concept is a Situation with explicit context and corresponds to SCTID 314641006. Parent concepts for general negative findings are overly broad, and sibling or child concepts indicating presence or specifying side/method are not supported by the wording."
736252007,Cancer care plan (record artifact),Cancer care plan documented,"This indicates that a cancer-focused care plan has been formally documented, which is a record artifact. The entry does not introduce treatment details, site, stage, or other qualifiers. Category: Record artifact. Cancer care plan (record artifact) [736252007] is the best match, as the action 'documented' refers to the existence of the plan artifact. Coding to a parent care plan is too generic, and to a treatment plan would be too narrow since the term 'care plan' is used."
7420003,Drowning in brackish water (event),Brackish water drowning (event),"The entry names an event of drowning with the water explicitly described as brackish, which corresponds exactly to SCTID 7420003 in the Event hierarchy. The parent concept of drowning lacks this environmental specificity, and sibling concepts for freshwater or saltwater differ in water type. Adding “(event)” clarifies category and does not change semantics; it remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
110612005,"Anus, rectum and sigmoid colon (combined site) (body structure)","Follow-up pertains to the anus, rectum and sigmoid colon region","The entry refers to the anatomical region pertinent to follow-up and explicitly lists anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon, identifying the combined site without adding clinical attributes such as severity or timing beyond context. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It best matches SCTID 110612005. Parent concepts are too broad, while sibling or child concepts that include only portions (anorectum, rectosigmoid, rectum alone, sigmoid colon alone, anus alone) are too narrow."
175818007,Ligation of short saphenous vein (procedure),The small saphenous vein was ligated,"This narrative indicates ligation (tie-off) of the small/short saphenous vein. It introduces no laterality, etiology, or additional techniques. It belongs to the Procedure category and matches SNOMED CT Ligation of short saphenous vein (175818007). It is more specific than a generic saphenous vein ligation and does not suggest related but different procedures such as stripping, excision, or ablation. Using 'small' as the anatomical synonym is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
406141002,Discussion with family about decision (situation),Decision-related discussion with family.,"The phrase indicates a discussion with family that relates to a decision, without specifying topic or outcomes. This is best coded as 'Discussion with family about decision' SCTID 406141002 within the situation hierarchy. It is not a procedural conference, consent event, or patient-only discussion. 'Decision-related' is a paraphrase of 'about decision' and is clinically equivalent."
1162998008,Sharp impact (physical force),Sports incident: sharp impact mechanism,"The statement identifies the mechanism in a sports context as a sharp impact. No injury details, site, or severity are included. Category: Physical force. The appropriate SNOMED concept is Sharp impact (physical force). Parent Impact (physical force) is overly broad, while siblings like Blunt impact or Penetrating force misalign with the described sharp impact mechanism."
247328001,Sensitive to touch (finding),Touch sensitivity documented,"The phrase indicates that the clinical finding—sensitivity to touch—has been documented, without adding site, severity, or etiology. This is a Clinical finding and best matches SNOMED CT 247328001 Sensitive to touch (finding). It does not imply pain as in tenderness/allodynia or broader sensory amplification as in hyperesthesia. The term is a documentation-style paraphrase that is clinically equivalent, preserving the code selection."
1240471000000102,Measurement of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen (observable entity),Laboratory observable: SARS-CoV-2 antigen measurement,"This entry frames the term explicitly as a laboratory observable, indicating the analyte (SARS-CoV-2 antigen) to be measured, with no mention of method, specimen, or result. The main concept is a lab observation of antigen measurement. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 1240471000000102 is the correct, most specific concept. Parent observables lack virus specificity, procedural siblings would represent the act of testing rather than the observed entity, and child concepts that encode presence/quantity or particular antigen proteins would add detail beyond the text."
411790001,Phleum pratense diagnostic allergen extract (product),Timothy grass allergen test extract (diagnostic),"The wording identifies a timothy grass-derived allergen extract intended for diagnostic testing, aligning with Phleum pratense diagnostic allergen extract. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The precise match is SCTID 411790001 because it denotes a diagnostic allergen extract specific to Phleum pratense. Parent concepts would be overly general, and siblings covering other species or therapeutic extracts would not reflect the diagnostic purpose. Substance entries such as “timothy grass pollen” represent materials rather than formulated diagnostic products. The inclusion of “(diagnostic)” ensures the intent without adding procedural details, keeping the code selection unchanged."
223665002,Finland (geographic location),Country: Finland,"The concept presented is Finland, identified explicitly as a country, which fits Finland (geographic location), SCTID 223665002 under the Location hierarchy. The context label “Country” does not alter the coded concept; it reinforces the geographic type. No timing, cause, or sublocation details are given. Parent or sibling concepts would be less accurate than the specific named country."
23325006,Repair of cardiac pacemaker (procedure),Repair of patient’s cardiac pacemaker,"The entry describes a repair performed on the patient’s cardiac pacemaker, emphasizing a device corrective procedure with no component-specific replacement or programming stated. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It accurately maps to Repair of cardiac pacemaker (procedure), SCTID 23325006. Parent classes are too broad, and sibling/child concepts like replacement, insertion, lead revision, battery change, or reprogramming are not implied. The possessive construction does not alter the clinical meaning or code selection."
223817001,Wexford (geographic location),Visit occurred in Wexford,"The phrase situates a visit in Wexford; the only codable entity is the geographic location Wexford. Category: Geographic location (Location). No administrative level or country detail is given, so Wexford (geographic location), SCTID 223817001, is the correct selection. Parent categories are too general, and more specific sibling/child concepts would add details not in the text."
102412001,Noise pollution (event),Observation: noise pollution.,"The observation records the presence of noise pollution as an event. The category is Event. It is best coded as SNOMED CT 102412001 Noise pollution (event). No additional attributes are present to warrant a different code, and broader environmental pollution or exposure-related concepts are less precise than the explicit event."
3801000175108,Pediatric pulmonology service (qualifier value),Pediatric pulmonary medicine clinical service,"Adding “clinical” does not change the core meaning: it remains the pediatric pulmonary medicine service. The entry is a service label lacking referral, setting, or timing attributes. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value and maps to 3801000175108. A parent “pulmonary medicine clinical service” would be nonspecific to pediatrics, while siblings like “pediatric pulmonary clinic” or “department” would describe organizational units, not the service qualifier. The use of a synonym (“pulmonary medicine”) for pulmonology is clinically equivalent and preserves code selection."
1204477007,Wallis (geographic location),Travel origin: Wallis,"The phrase captures the origin for travel as “Wallis,” with the focus on the geographic place. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The exact match is Wallis (geographic location), SCTID 1204477007. Parent or sibling concepts are not as precise because the entry is specific to Wallis alone. The travel-origin context does not alter coding; it remains a location concept without added clinical attributes."
276218009,Procedure type (qualifier value),Procedure type,"The entry states the concept 'procedure type' without any additional attributes, which directly corresponds to the SNOMED CT qualifier value Procedure type (276218009). Category: Qualifier value. It describes a generic classification facet applied to procedures, not a specific procedure, method, intent, approach, site, or status. Using this term does not introduce timing, severity, laterality, or cause. A parent concept like 'Qualifier value' would be too general, and sibling qualifiers such as 'Procedure intent' or 'Procedure approach' are not indicated by the wording. Therefore, 276218009 is the most precise match."
780903008,Harvest of bone graft from tarsal bone and metatarsal bone (procedure),Final op report: tarsal and metatarsal bones used to harvest bone graft.,"This entry confirms in the final operative report that bone graft was harvested using both tarsal and metatarsal bones as donor sources, with no additional attributes such as laterality or technique. It is a Procedure. SCTID 780903008 is the exact match, as it denotes harvest from both tarsal and metatarsal bones; generic harvest codes omit anatomical specificity, and single-site harvest codes would not reflect both donors. The wording is a direct paraphrase and preserves the same concept."
72796006,Nerve cell and nerve fiber function (observable entity),Nerve cell and nerve fiber function (observable),"Adding '(observable)' clarifies the category without changing meaning; it still denotes the functional property of nerve cells and fibers. No results or contextual attributes are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 72796006 directly matches this observable. Parent categories like 'nervous system function' lack the explicit dual focus on cells and fibers, and child/sibling concepts for only axonal or only neuronal function are insufficient. It does not refer to a specific test or a finding."
258483004,Mucus specimen (specimen),Mucus specimen on requisition,"A requisition note naming the specimen as mucus identifies the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 'Mucus specimen' (258483004). The context of requisition does not alter the specimen type or introduce attributes like site, preventing mapping to parent or site-specific child concepts."
225746001,Ward (environment),Ward site,"The wording indicates the site/location is a ward, which aligns with 225746001 Ward (environment). The main concept is environmental; “site” here is a synonym for place/location, not a clinical specimen site. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The entry stays generic and does not specify a particular ward type, so child or sibling concepts are not a better fit."
735322007,Termination of pregnancy inpatient care plan (record artifact),Admission note: termination of pregnancy inpatient care plan entered,"This describes documentation at admission that an inpatient care plan for termination of pregnancy was created, highlighting the record artifact. The category is Record artifact, and the specific SNOMED CT concept is SCTID 735322007. Mentioning 'admission note' is contextual and does not alter the artifact type or add clinical attributes. Parent or sibling concepts that omit the TOP focus or inpatient setting are less precise, and procedure-related codes are inappropriate since this is a plan record."
1365865007,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror and corrected of maxilla with mouth open (record artifact),"Patient report: They took an intraoral photo through a mirror of my upper jaw, corrected, with my mouth open.","Even in patient-reported style, the statement captures the essential attributes: intraoral photo, mirror usage, correction, upper jaw (maxilla), mouth open. This refers to a Record artifact of the imaging rather than a clinical finding. SCTID 1365865007 is appropriate since it matches the precise combination; broader or sibling artifacts without these attributes (e.g., mandibular, closed mouth, uncorrected) would not fit. “Upper jaw” safely synonymizes maxilla and does not introduce additional information."
248714006,Abdominal aortic bruit (finding),Abdominal aortic bruit present on physical exam,"This note records the presence of an abdominal aortic bruit during physical examination. It is a Clinical finding and maps directly to SNOMED 248714006. It avoids broader or different-site bruits and does not add causative, severity, or timing attributes that would necessitate alternative coding."
310128004,Computed tomography service (qualifier value),CT service — modality,"The entry underscores modality context while identifying CT as the service, which is semantically equivalent to 'Computed tomography service'. Category: Qualifier value. It matches SCTID 310128004, not a CT procedure or a generic modality parent. No anatomical site, contrast, or timing is mentioned, preventing more granular child codes and ensuring a precise service qualifier mapping."
285140009,At risk environment (environment),Environment classified as at risk,"The concept is an environment that has been classified as at risk; no additional attributes such as setting, etiology, or severity are introduced. Category: Environment. The best match is At risk environment (environment) [285140009], since the statement is about the risk status of the environment itself. Parent generic environment concepts lack the risk attribute, and sibling/child concepts would specify particular environments or specific hazards, which the entry does not. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term and maintains the same coding."
170634005,Asthma disturbs sleep frequently (finding),Asthma often disrupts sleep.,"The term “often” is clinically synonymous with “frequently,” and “disrupts sleep” is equivalent to “disturbs sleep,” maintaining the same core finding: asthma is the cause of frequent sleep disturbance. This is a Clinical finding and matches “Asthma disturbs sleep frequently” (SCTID 170634005). Parent concepts without a frequency qualifier would be less specific, and disorder-level concepts (e.g., insomnia due to asthma) or nocturnal asthma are not implied by this wording."
16215491000119108,Specimen from breast duct obtained by excision (specimen),Excisional biopsy specimen of breast duct,"This describes a specimen from the breast duct acquired specifically by excisional biopsy, i.e., removal by excision. It is a Specimen concept, and because the method is excision, it matches SNOMED CT 16215491000119108. A sibling concept for biopsy-obtained (method unspecified) could be less precise since 'excisional biopsy' specifies excision; parent concepts that generalize to breast tissue or duct without method are less exact."
228697004,Yttrium 90 therapy (procedure),Y-90 treatment administered,"This describes the administration of a therapeutic procedure using Y-90, which is a Procedure. The appropriate code is Yttrium 90 therapy (procedure) SCTID 228697004. The wording does not add organ, technique, or indication details. More specific children (e.g., Y-90 microsphere embolization) are not implied, and broader parents like generic radionuclide therapy are less precise than naming the agent."
298751004,Tenderness of upper limb (finding),Documented upper extremity tenderness on evaluation,"The entry records a finding of tenderness in the upper extremity during evaluation, with no laterality or severity. This is a Clinical finding. The best match is Tenderness of upper limb (298751004). A broader tenderness code would omit the site, and more specific children (e.g., wrist tenderness) would not be supported. Siblings involving pain without palpation or unrelated findings are not correct because the focus is tenderness."
80129000,Murine hepatitis virus (organism),Murine hepatitis virus mentioned,"This text mentions the organism by name only, which corresponds to SNOMED CT Organism 80129000. The entry does not add attributes like presence, exposure, or subtype. Therefore, broader parent concepts or narrower strain variants are not appropriate, and it is not a clinical finding or disorder term."
224048003,Florida (geographic location),Florida (US state),"This entry confirms the administrative level (state) and the country without adding other attributes. The main concept is the geographic location Florida. The SNOMED CT category is Location and the precise code is 224048003. A parent like United States would be broader; any sibling (e.g., Texas) or child (e.g., Orlando) would be incorrect given the wording."
60661000087106,Vascular prosthesis submitted as specimen (specimen),Vascular prosthesis sent to pathology as specimen,"The wording indicates that a vascular prosthesis was sent to pathology in the capacity of a specimen. Category: Specimen. There are no mentions of type, location, or complications. It avoids mapping to parent ‘prosthesis specimen’ or sibling device/tissue types. The concept aligns directly with SCTID 60661000087106."
468415004,"Dental prosthesis restorative material, unfilled resin (physical object)",Prosthesis restorative resin (unfilled),"The phrase 'prosthesis restorative resin (unfilled)' identifies a Physical object used in prosthodontics and specifies the 'unfilled' material status. This corresponds to SCTID 468415004. A more general 'prosthesis restorative resin' without the unfilled qualifier would be a parent concept, and variants with fillers would be siblings, which are not supported by this wording. The parenthetical indication is a synonymic detail that maintains exact material specification."
263501003,Time of onset (observable entity),Onset time documented in chart,"The entry refers to documentation of the clock time when the phenomenon began, keeping the focus squarely on the time-of-onset property. It corresponds to Time of onset (Observable entity, SCTID 263501003). The context of chart documentation does not alter the observable type, and the wording excludes date, age, or duration, making other siblings like “Date of onset” or “Time since onset” inappropriate."
223540007,Malawi (geographic location),Malawi — national territory,"“National territory” is a type descriptor that refers to the sovereign country’s geographic entity, which is Malawi. It does not add unrelated attributes. This maps to Malawi (geographic location), SCTID 223540007, under the Geographic location category. Parents (continent or generic territory) are too broad, and child/sibling locations are not indicated, making Malawi the most precise match."
411838002,Ulocladium chartarum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Ulocladium chartarum diagnostic allergen extract label,"‘Label’ implies packaging information, but the product referenced remains the diagnostic allergen extract from Ulocladium chartarum. Attributes explicitly are diagnostic use and species. SNOMED CT category: Product (pharmaceutical/biologic product). This corresponds to 411838002. Generic parent or therapeutic sibling concepts would misrepresent specificity or intent. The label context does not introduce new attributes like dose, route, or formulation."
266708002,Prescription given with no examination of subject (situation),No examination was performed; prescription given.,"The entry links the absence of examination directly with the act of giving a prescription, fitting SNOMED CT 266708002 exactly. The category is Situation. A parent concept describing only prescription issuance is insufficiently specific, and a sibling focusing only on lack of examination would miss the prescribing event. The phrasing remains within the concept’s scope without adding unrelated attributes."
465868000,"Soft corrective contact lens, extended-wear (physical object)",Extended-wear soft prescription contact lens,"“Prescription” is a clinically safe synonym for corrective in contact lens usage. The entry includes soft material and extended-wear modality. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 465868000 is the correct code for a soft corrective contact lens that is extended-wear. A parent like “Soft contact lens” or “Corrective contact lens” without extended-wear is too general, and siblings like rigid lenses or daily-wear variants do not match. No additional attributes are introduced."
54945002,Planorbarius (organism),Genus Planorbarius,"The phrase identifies the taxonomic rank and name: genus Planorbarius. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. By explicitly indicating 'genus,' this selects the exact concept SCTID 54945002 rather than a broader family (Planorbidae) or a specific species (child concept). No causation, exposure, or clinical attributes are stated; it is purely a taxonomic identifier, making the genus-level organism code the correct and most specific match."
223566005,Sao Tome and Principe (geographic location),Place name: São Tomé and Príncipe,The entry designates a place name and specifies the country São Tomé and Príncipe. The main concept is the geographic location of that country. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223566005 is appropriate; parents (continent/region) and children (islands or municipalities) would not fit the whole-country reference. The generic term “Place name” provides context only and does not alter the coded concept.
366282004,Urinary volume finding (finding),Amount of urine produced – clinical finding,"The phrase identifies the amount of urine produced as a clinical finding, which is equivalent to urinary volume finding and maps to SNOMED CT 366282004. Category: Clinical finding. It does not specify whether the amount is high, low, or normal, avoiding child concepts. It is not a request or procedure, keeping it within the finding hierarchy."
366147009,Finding of respiratory measurements (finding),Finding of respiratory measurements,"This is a verbatim paraphrase of the preferred term, indicating a finding that arises from respiratory measurements without specifying which measurement or any value/state. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. SCTID 366147009 exactly matches this description. Parent concepts of measurement findings are too broad, and sibling or child concepts (e.g., specific respiratory parameter findings) would be overly detailed. The phrase is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and therefore maps directly to the same code."
787610003,Photographic image corrected intraoral mirrored visible record (record artifact),Dental photograph: corrected intraoral mirrored visible record,"The entry specifies a dental photograph that is corrected, intraoral, mirrored, and in the visible spectrum, presented as a record. The category is Record artifact. All defining attributes match SCTID 787610003. Parent concepts like general dental photographic records without mirroring or correction, or siblings like extraoral photos, are less precise. The wording employs safe synonyms that preserve the intended semantics."
391927008,Zeiss-type goniolens (physical object),Replacement ordered: Zeiss-type goniolens,"The device specified for replacement is a Zeiss-type goniolens, which is a Physical object (device). The replacement context does not change or add attributes to the device. Because the Zeiss-type design is stated, SCTID 391927008 is the best match. A parent concept would be too general, and sibling designs are excluded. The entry refrains from including additional properties that could suggest a different device subtype."
242631000,Bite of fish (event),Event: fish bite,"Labeling it explicitly as an event indicates an external cause mechanism and matches Bite of fish (event), SCTID 242631000. The SNOMED CT category is Event. No additional attributes (e.g., body site, severity, timing, or resultant injury) are present, so disorder or clinical finding codes are not appropriate. A broader concept like Animal bite (event) would be less precise, and species-specific children like Shark bite are not indicated. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent expression of the preferred term."
35281000087100,Surgical stainless steel suture submitted as specimen (specimen),Container contents: surgical stainless steel suture (specimen),"The entry states that the specimen container holds a surgical stainless steel suture. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This corresponds to SCTID 35281000087100, defining the specimen by type and material. General suture specimens would lack material specificity, and siblings for other materials would be wrong. The device concept is not applicable because the focus is on the submitted specimen."
21558008,Flaring of alae nasi (finding),Nasal flaring,"This entry conveys the same observable phenomenon: the nasal alae are flaring. It represents a Clinical finding, aligning with SNOMED CT concept 21558008. The term is a common clinical synonym for flaring of alae nasi and does not add attributes like etiology or severity, so mapping to parent categories (e.g., respiratory signs) or to other nasal structural findings would be less specific. It is not a different condition such as retraction or structural deformity, keeping the selection to this exact finding."
725436006,Structure of joint of right lower limb (body structure),Clinical site documented: right lower extremity joint,"The phrase states that the clinical site documented is a joint of the right lower extremity. The main concept is a body structure site: joint + right + lower extremity. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 725436006 is the correct code as it captures joint structure in the right lower limb without naming the specific joint. Parent concepts would be broader by lacking laterality, and child concepts (e.g., right knee joint) are not indicated. The documentation context does not introduce any additional clinical attributes."
409988000,Sub-Saharan Africa (geographic location),Sub-Saharan Africa (place),"The entry reiterates the geographic region and indicates it as a 'place', which is a categorical clarifier, not a new attribute. It strictly denotes the location south of the Sahara. The SNOMED CT category is Location. It matches concept 409988000 more precisely than parent (Africa) or any child subregions (e.g., West Africa). The synonymic descriptor does not alter the meaning or scope."
240925007,Endarterectomy of crural artery (procedure),Open surgical endarterectomy of crural artery,"Endarterectomy is, by definition, a surgical procedure to remove intima from an artery; “open surgical” is a common descriptive phrase that does not alter the concept. The body site remains a crural artery (lower leg). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The most precise match is Endarterectomy of crural artery (procedure), SCTID 240925007. A parent concept omits the crural site, while child concepts that name a specific tibial or peroneal artery would be too granular. Sibling procedures at other sites (femoral, popliteal) are incorrect given the crural designation. The wording adds no laterality, timing, or cause."
283904009,Memory form (observable entity),Memory form reviewed at follow-up,"The entry states that the form of memory was reviewed at follow-up, with no added outcomes or qualities. The main concept is the 'memory form' observable being revisited. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, matching SCTID 283904009. This is the correct code because it refers to the form characteristic, not function, content, or impairment. Parent or sibling observables would be less suitable since the phrase is specific to 'form'."
11184008,"Urinalysis, blood, qualitative (procedure)",Urine blood qualitative dipstick test,"The phrase denotes a dipstick-based qualitative test for blood in urine, which is a component of urinalysis. SNOMED CT category: Procedure (Laboratory procedure). It aligns with 11184008 because the dipstick blood pad produces a qualitative result. Parent or sibling concepts including quantitative RBC counts or non-blood analytes are not indicated. The synonym set (“test,” “dipstick”) is clinically equivalent to a urinalysis blood qualitative procedure."
260366006,Increase (qualifier value),Rising,"“Rising” expresses the same qualifier concept as “increase,” denoting upward change in magnitude. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 260366006 is appropriate because the term reflects directional change without specifying what is changing or introducing degree, laterality, or causation. Parent concepts like “Change” are less specific, and sibling concepts describing states (e.g., “High,” “Raised”) are not about change. The synonym preserves equivalence."
275692008,Wart clinic (environment),Services delivered in the wart clinic environment,"The statement identifies the environment as a wart clinic where services are delivered, focusing on the location rather than any additional clinical details. Category: Environment or geographical location. This matches Wart clinic (environment), SCTID 275692008. More general clinic codes or different specialty environments would be less accurate. The wording is a contextual phrasing but retains equivalence to the environment concept and does not alter code selection."
299605000,Range of toe abduction (observable entity),Range of toe abduction,"The entry explicitly names the measurable property being observed: the range of abduction of the toes. This is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT, not a clinical finding or disorder, and maps precisely to SCTID 299605000. It does not introduce laterality, specific toes, abnormality, cause, degree, or timing. Broader parents like range of toe motion would be less specific, and siblings such as range of toe adduction or flexion refer to different movements. This exact phrasing matches the concept and avoids child concepts that would specify a particular toe (e.g., hallux)."
425488009,Actinomyces oricola (organism),"Actinomyces oricola, as named by the lab","The statement conveys the organism’s name assigned by the laboratory: Actinomyces oricola, without adding detection status or clinical attributes. The main concept is the organism species. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 425488009 exactly fits this species. Parent genus codes or sibling species would misrepresent the specificity. The wording is contextual but still purely taxonomic."
404959003,Child development: 4 years (observable entity),Age four developmental status (child),"This phrase labels the observed developmental status of a child at age four, without indicating outcomes or specific subdomains. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The most accurate code is SCTID 404959003, which represents the age-specific child development observation. Parent or sibling concepts that are not age four would not match the stated age. 'Developmental status' is clinically synonymous with the general child development observable here."
432097003,Specimen from artery obtained by biopsy (specimen),Arterial tissue—biopsy specimen,"This wording states that arterial tissue was obtained as a biopsy specimen, which sits squarely in the Specimen domain. It captures the essential attributes (artery and biopsy) of SCTID 432097003 without introducing additional qualifiers such as site specificity or timing. It is not a procedure code, nor does it suggest blood or excision specimens. As a synonym, it preserves the same meaning as the preferred term, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate."
223710007,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (geographic location),Travel history: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,"This context places the country within a travel-history section, but the value is solely the location. The SNOMED CT concept is the Geographic location Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, SCTID 223710007. Parent regional concepts are too broad; child sublocations (islands or cities) are too narrow. The wording does not introduce temporal detail or clinical attributes, so the geographic location code remains the exact match."
223620006,Australasian country (geographic location),Country belonging to Australasia,"This entry specifies a country that belongs to the Australasian region and does not identify a specific nation or add further qualifiers. The main concept is a country-level geographic location within Australasia. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location; the exact match is Australasian country (geographic location), SCTID 223620006. Using the parent concept Country would ignore the Australasian qualifier, and selecting any named country would be over-specific. Sibling regional concepts are inappropriate because the entry is explicitly at the country level."
385361009,International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage for gynecological malignancy (observable entity),Oncologic stage per FIGO for gynecologic malignancy,"This phrasing identifies the oncologic stage as determined under FIGO for gynecologic malignancy, which denotes the stage observable rather than a procedure or a numeric stage assignment. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 385361009 aligns exactly, as it is the FIGO stage for gynecological cancers. Siblings like TNM stage or AJCC stage are not implied, and no site-specific child is indicated. The paraphrase (“per FIGO”) is clinically equivalent without adding attributes."
306372006,Entire ethmoidal bulla (body structure),"Ethmoid bulla, entire","This entry identifies the ethmoid bulla and clarifies that the entire structure is meant. As an anatomical Body structure, the best match is 306372006 (Entire ethmoidal bulla). The modifier “entire” avoids mapping to concepts that represent a partial structure (e.g., wall or cell segment) or laterality variants. Parent categories like general ethmoid or paranasal anatomy are too broad, and sibling concepts specifying sides or subparts are inappropriate given the whole-structure specification."
443451000124109,Pediatric standard formula (product),Order: pediatric standard formula,"Even in ordering context, the named item is the product: standard pediatric formula; category: Product. The exact match is Pediatric standard formula (product), SCTID 443451000124109, which encodes pediatric applicability and standard formulation. The text does not add specialty features, route, or dose-form, so it should not be mapped to enteral or specialized pediatric formulas. Parent concepts that lack the standard qualifier would be less specific than this entry."
1269501001,Procedure section (record artifact),Procedure section in the chart,"The entry refers to the procedures section as part of the patient chart, which is a record artifact section. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact; Procedure section (record artifact) [1269501001] is the most accurate match. It does not specify past or planned procedures, nor a particular document type beyond the chart. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling sections like History of procedures are not suggested. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
407059007,Brain natriuretic peptide (substance),BNP,"BNP is the standard abbreviation for brain natriuretic peptide and refers to the same biochemical substance. The correct SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 407059007 is the most specific code. There is no mention of measurement, result, or testing, so coding to an observable or procedure would be incorrect. The term does not indicate related siblings like NT-proBNP or proBNP, nor a broader class like natriuretic peptides in general. As a synonym, BNP is clinically equivalent to 'Brain natriuretic peptide' and does not change code selection."
269691005,Medical accident to patient during surgical and medical care (event),Case note: medical accident to patient occurred during medical/surgical care,"The case note indicates that a medical accident to the patient occurred in the context of medical/surgical care, which aligns with SNOMED CT Event 269691005. It does not add mechanism, injury type, severity, or outcomes, so it remains appropriately coded as an event rather than a complication or injury. Parent or sibling concepts are either too broad or imply different semantics. The contextual 'case note' preface does not modify the core concept."
424192002,Distance vision 20/400 (finding),Assessment: distance vision 20/400.,"This assessment line records the clinical finding of distance vision at 20/400. The main concept is distance visual acuity, with the attribute of a specific numeric acuity value. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 424192002 is the exact match for Distance vision 20/400. Broader parent or generic acuity concepts lack value specificity, and sibling concepts reflect different acuity levels or near vision, which are not stated. No laterality or correction qualifiers are present, so no more specific subtype should be chosen."
277459008,Daumas-Duport grading system (staging scale),Assessment scale: Daumas–Duport grading,"This specifies the assessment/staging scale in use by name, and includes no grade result, severity, timing, or associated condition. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale (Qualifier value). SCTID 277459008 is the precise concept for the Daumas–Duport grading system. Parent categories like 'assessment scale' or 'staging scale' would be less specific, and sibling systems are not implicated. The term 'grading' aligns with the same scale and is a clinically equivalent way to refer to the system."
300620001,Ability to use public transport (observable entity),Capability to use public transportation,"This entry expresses the same concept using 'public transportation' as a synonym. It denotes a capacity domain and fits the Observable entity type, mapping to SNOMED CT 300620001. Findings or procedure terms (e.g., assessed capability) would introduce different categories; similarly, behaviors like actual use would be sibling concepts that are not indicated here."
225730009,Bed area (environment),Area by the bed,"The phrase identifies the environment adjacent to the bed, which is synonymous with the bed area and maps to Bed area (environment) SCTID 225730009. No extraneous attributes are present; the concept is purely locational. Category: Environment or geographical location. This is correctly coded to the bed area rather than the bed object or the entire room environment. Other sibling concepts (e.g., bedside, bed space) are not implied, ensuring the precision of this mapping."
223723000,Uruguay (geographic location),Oriental Republic of Uruguay,"This is the official English rendering of the country’s formal name and unambiguously denotes the same geographic entity. It belongs to the SNOMED Location hierarchy as a Geographic location. The precise code is Uruguay (geographic location) 223723000. A parent concept like Geographic location or Country would be less specific, while siblings (other countries) and children (regions or cities in Uruguay) are not suggested. The synonym changes wording only, not attributes."
248529005,Lump size (observable entity),Lump size attribute,"This entry represents the attribute of size for a lump, describing the same observable entity without additional qualifiers like location or trend. It belongs to the Observable entity category and maps to SNOMED CT 248529005 Lump size (observable entity). General size attributes would be too broad, and terms like mass size or tumor size are different entities. Using “attribute” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the observable and does not alter code selection."
95979002,Trichloroethyl alcohol (substance),Trichloroethyl alcohol (substance),"This entry precisely echoes the SNOMED CT preferred term and explicitly notes the concept type “(substance).” The main concept is the chemical entity only; no clinical findings, test results, exposures, or product attributes are stated. Therefore, the appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 95979002 directly matches this label. Mapping to parent classes (e.g., ethanol derivatives) or siblings (e.g., trichloroethylene) would reduce specificity or be incorrect chemically. Using the preferred term ensures the most precise match to Trichloroethyl alcohol (substance)."
52423008,Product containing tar (product),Medicinal product containing tar,"This entry specifies a medicinal product and states tar as an ingredient, without adding route, dose, or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Product (pharmaceutical/biologic product). It maps precisely to SCTID 52423008 because the concept covers medicinal products with tar. Parent concepts like 'Medicinal product' are too broad, while children like 'coal tar 5% lotion' or 'tar shampoo' introduce granularity not present. 'Medicinal product' is a valid synonym for the product domain and maintains equivalence."
34222006,Rikenella microfusus (organism),Clinician documentation: Rikenella microfusus,"This is clinician note context paired with the exact organism name Rikenella microfusus. The concept is the organism itself, mapping to SNOMED CT Organism SCTID 34222006. The entry avoids attributes that would imply a finding, procedure, or disorder. Broader or alternative organism concepts are not suggested, so the species-level code is the most accurate and specific representation."
232615005,Exploration of tracheostomy (procedure),Exploration of tracheostomy stoma,"The entry targets the tracheostomy stoma for exploration, which is the anatomical opening of the tracheostomy and is clinically equivalent to exploration of the tracheostomy. Category: Procedure; SNOMED SCTID 232615005. The phrase avoids adding attributes like indications or outcome. Alternatives like inspection (non-procedural), revision (repair), or tube exchange would be incorrect, and broader airway exploration would be less specific than this tracheostomy-focused procedure."
359616000,Smothering (event),Patient states: smothered,"The patient-reported phrase indicates occurrence of smothering without adding attributes like timing or intent. Category: Event. Using the past participle conveys the same event and mechanism, which is clinically equivalent to 'smothering.' Parent concepts like suffocation/asphyxiation would be less precise, and siblings like choking or strangulation are not implied. Thus, Smothering (event) is the proper code."
781103002,Ochroconis musae (organism),Fungal species: Ochroconis musae,"Main concept: the fungal species Ochroconis musae. The entry adds only taxonomic classification, not clinical attributes. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Because the species is explicitly named, SCTID 781103002 is the precise code. Broader concepts like 'Fungus' or 'Ochroconis (organism)' are less specific; infection or disease codes are not indicated by this taxonomic phrasing."
111951006,Longevity (observable entity),Longevity mentioned by patient,"The salient concept is longevity, noted as being mentioned by the patient. This is context only and does not introduce attributes that would modify the observable’s semantics. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 111951006 (Observable entity). It does not imply life expectancy (prediction) or survival duration tied to disease. Thus, Longevity is the appropriate, specific code."
86963009,Lower respiratory tract mucus (substance),Lower respiratory tract mucus,"The text explicitly names the material “lower respiratory tract mucus,” which is the substance present in the lower airways. There are no added attributes such as quantity, color, abnormality, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 86963009 is the most precise match because it denotes mucus specifically from the lower respiratory tract; broader parents like “Mucus (substance)” are less specific, and siblings/children such as “bronchial mucus” or “upper respiratory tract mucus” would be anatomically narrower or incorrect. No terms suggest expectoration or specimen status, so concepts like “Sputum (substance)” or any Specimen concepts are inappropriate."
430310001,Cytologic material obtained from sputum (specimen),Patient report: “They took a sputum sample for cytology.”,"This patient-reported statement indicates that the specimen taken was sputum intended for cytology, which denotes cytologic material obtained from sputum. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 430310001 in the Specimen category. The wording does not add attributes like quantity, timing, or associated diagnosis. It is more precise than generic cytologic material (no source) and more specific than a nonspecific sputum specimen (no cytology)."
762041004,Structure of third metacarpal bone of left hand (body structure),Left middle finger metacarpal bone,"This entry designates the metacarpal associated with the middle finger (digit III) on the left hand, specifying a bone and thus a Body structure. It precisely matches SCTID 762041004. Using a parent concept for any left metacarpal would miss the finger/ordinal specificity, and a child concept (e.g., base of the left middle finger metacarpal) is not indicated. The synonymy between “middle finger metacarpal” and “third metacarpal” is clinically standard and does not change code selection."
681381000119103,History of infection of total knee joint prosthesis (situation),Previous infection of total knee prosthesis,"This entry denotes that the prosthetic total knee had an infection previously, clearly a historical finding rather than an active disorder. The medical concept is past infection of a total knee joint prosthesis. SNOMED CT category: Situation. SCTID 681381000119103 is exact for this scenario. Concepts for current prosthesis infection are not suitable because the term 'previous' signals history. More general history-of-infection concepts without specifying the total knee prosthesis are less precise. No extra attributes (e.g., severity, laterality, organism) are introduced."
411427009,Sesquiterpene lactone mix (product),Dispensary item name: sesquiterpene lactone mix product,"The dispensary context still points to the product as the item name, avoiding procedure, route, or dose implications. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. SCTID 411427009 matches because the entry identifies the product entity. Parent categories are generic; child concepts specifying formulation details would be overly specific. The phrasing keeps the semantic focus strictly on the product without introducing new attributes."
182104001,Entire neck of talus (body structure),Complete neck of the talus,"The entry conveys the entire anatomical neck of the talus through 'complete,' free of additional attributes. As a Body structure, the most precise code is SCTID 182104001 (Entire neck of talus). Using 'Neck of talus' alone would be less specific about extent, and sibling concepts involving different talus regions or laterality do not fit. 'Complete' is a safe synonym for 'entire' in anatomical context."
1338051003,Provision of microwave oven (procedure),Equipment provision: microwave oven,"This formulation indicates that the equipment provision action pertains specifically to a microwave oven, clearly identifying the performed procedure without extra qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The exact code is 1338051003 Provision of microwave oven (procedure); coding to a generic Provision of equipment would be less precise, and device-only concepts or other appliance procedures would be incorrect. The wording is a direct paraphrase that maintains equivalence to the preferred term."
257651001,Office building (environment),Setting: office building,"This entry identifies the setting as an office building without introducing other qualifiers or events. The main concept is the location type (office building). The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps precisely to Office building (environment) SCTID: 257651001 and is more specific than the parent Building (environment). It avoids siblings such as Factory building and does not drift into Office (environment), which is a smaller unit than a whole building."
223755000,Kyushu (geographic location),Kyushu (toponym),"Calling Kyushu a “toponym” indicates it is a place name, which is still the same geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 223755000 best matches the entry. Parent, sibling, or child concepts are not more suitable because the text names Kyushu specifically. The descriptor is contextual and does not add attributes that change coding."
228516001,Chews loose leaf tobacco (finding),Reports chewing loose leaf tobacco,"A patient-reported statement that they chew loose leaf tobacco, with no additional attributes like timing or frequency. The main medical concept is the behavior of chewing loose-leaf tobacco, fitting the Clinical finding category. The exact SNOMED CT match is “Chews loose leaf tobacco (finding)” SCTID 228516001. Using a parent code for general chewing tobacco or smokeless tobacco would be less specific, and sibling codes for other forms (plug/twist) or non-chewing (snuff/dip) would be inaccurate. “Reports chewing loose leaf tobacco” is a synonym that maintains the same concept."
161546008,History of nephritis (situation),Charted history of nephritis,"“Charted history” indicates that nephritis is documented as a prior condition, which fits the Situation with explicit context class. This maps to SNOMED CT 161546008. The entry does not introduce subtypes (e.g., glomerulonephritis), severity, or causes, ruling out child concepts. Parent concepts such as history of renal disease are broader than necessary, and using the nephritis disorder code would misrepresent the historical nature."
223507003,Asia minor (geographic location),Asia Minor recorded in intake,"The main concept is Asia Minor, the geographic location recorded during intake; the context is administrative and does not change the entity. In SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location under Location and corresponds to SCTID 223507003. No broader or narrower region is implied, and no additional attributes are introduced. The entry is semantically equivalent to the concept name."
223998009,South Georgia (geographic location),Event location: South Georgia,"The entry specifies an event took place at a named location; the codable entity is the location South Georgia. The main concept is a geographic location, matching SNOMED CT South Georgia (geographic location), SCTID 223998009. The event context does not add geography-related attributes or broaden the scope. Thus, parents are too general, and siblings referring to different or larger places are not appropriate."
300765001,Does not perform creative activity (finding),Does not undertake creative activity,"The wording indicates the person does not undertake (i.e., perform) creative activity, without introducing impairment or timing attributes. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 300765001 is the exact match for non-performance of creative activity. Codes for inability or for other activity domains would introduce meanings not present. ‘Undertake’ is a suitable synonym for perform/engage, maintaining the concept’s scope."
37967004,Peprilus alepidotus (organism),Peprilus alepidotus,"The entry states the exact scientific species name Peprilus alepidotus with no added qualifiers, which directly corresponds to the SNOMED CT organism concept for this species (category: Organism). This is the most precise match because it specifies the species-level taxon rather than a broader genus (e.g., Peprilus) or a different species (siblings like Peprilus triacanthus or Peprilus paru). No attributes such as exposure, disease, severity, or timing are introduced; it is purely the organism name, making 37967004 the correct code."
224697006,Recreation room (environment),Recreation room environment,"This explicitly names the environment as a recreation room, reinforcing the environmental category. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate category is Environment or geographical location, and SCTID 224697006 is the exact code. A parent concept like 'Room (environment)' is too general, and sibling environments (e.g., 'Lounge', 'Playroom') differ in intended use. The added word 'environment' is clarifying rather than introducing new attributes, so the concept remains uniquely the recreation room."
328708006,Gluten-free macaroni (product),Patient uses gluten-free macaroni,"The entry indicates patient use of the product gluten-free macaroni without adding other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This maps to SCTID 328708006 because it identifies the precise product (macaroni) with the gluten-free attribute, rather than a broader or different pasta type. It avoids extra details like portion, preparation, or brand."
224072008,Nebraska (geographic location),Nebraska—US geographic location,"The entry explicitly states that Nebraska is a U.S. geographic location, reinforcing the place semantics. The SNOMED CT concept category is Geographic location (Location), with Nebraska (geographic location) SCTID 224072008 as the exact match. Broader or narrower geography would not fit the stated level; siblings are other locations. The wording adds no clinical attributes."
329061000119105,Long-term current use of belimumab (situation),Patient remains on belimumab long-term.,"This patient-oriented documentation confirms continued, current therapy with belimumab and explicitly denotes long-term status. The concept is a Situation describing the ongoing long-term use of a specific medication. SCTID 329061000119105 matches exactly. Concepts related to procedures (e.g., administration) or general long-term drug use without specifying belimumab would not be as specific, and statements of 'history of' past use would be incorrect for 'remains on.'"
242806004,Exposure to medical diagnostic radiation (event),Exposure event: medical diagnostic radiation,"This entry explicitly frames the concept as an exposure event to medical diagnostic radiation, with no additional attributes. The main concept is exposure to medical diagnostic radiation as an event. SNOMED CT category: Event. It aligns exactly with 242806004 by specifying the source of exposure as diagnostic medical radiation. Broader exposure concepts or non-medical sources are excluded, and no modality-specific child terms are introduced. The phrasing is a direct, clinically equivalent synonym."
144171000119108,Family history of autosomal translocation (situation),Pedigree positive for autosomal translocation,"The entry indicates a pedigree (family history) finding of autosomal translocation. It does not state translocation type, specific chromosomes, or the patient's status. This is a Situation with explicit context. 'Family history of autosomal translocation (situation)' is the most precise code because it reflects a family-history context about autosomal translocation. Parent concepts covering chromosomal rearrangements in general or sibling concepts focused on sex chromosomes would be less appropriate. The term 'positive' simply indicates presence in family history and does not alter the concept."
30003003,Pseudorca crassidens (organism),Taxon: Pseudorca crassidens,"The entry identifies the taxonomic unit at the species level, Pseudorca crassidens, mapping to SNOMED CT SCTID 30003003. Main concept: organism taxonomy at species rank; the contextual label 'Taxon' does not add extraneous attributes. Category: Organism. It explicitly avoids parent taxa and does not introduce sibling species ambiguity, so the species concept is the most accurate code."
74924008,Human coxsackievirus A7 (organism),Organism: Coxsackievirus A7 (human),"The entry states the organism name as Coxsackievirus A7 (human), which corresponds to the organism concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It maps exactly to 74924008 and avoids broader or sibling concepts. The phrasing does not imply detection or disease; it is strictly a taxonomic designation."
223766007,Masbate (geographic location),Geographic location—Masbate,"This explicitly frames Masbate as a geographic location, aligning exactly with the SNOMED CT concept Masbate (geographic location), SCTID 223766007, within the Location/Geographic location hierarchy. There are no qualifiers suggesting administrative level or landform, so child or sibling concepts like city or island are excluded. The wording is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and does not modify code selection."
309924002,Diabetic department (environment),Listed department: Diabetology Department,"The entry names an environmental department centered on diabetology, i.e., diabetes-focused care. It belongs to the Environment semantic tag and aligns with Diabetic department (environment) [309924002]. The 'listed' context is documentation metadata and does not introduce attributes. More general department codes are insufficiently specific, and alternatives like endocrinology department or clinic/unit would not represent the same departmental environment."
13930000,Abnormal presence of protein (finding),Follow-up: abnormal protein present,"In a follow-up context, the entry states only that protein is present abnormally, with no detail on specimen, degree, duration, or cause. This maps to the Clinical finding 'Abnormal presence of protein (finding)' (13930000). Child concepts like 'Proteinuria' require urine context, which is absent, and broader parents would be nonspecific. The follow-up label is contextual and does not alter the clinical meaning or coding."
251417004,Second glass appearance (observable entity),Second glass appearance documented on report,"This report-style phrase indicates that the parameter 'second glass appearance' was documented, without stating the value. Category: Observable entity. It fits SCTID 251417004 because it distinctly references the second portion’s appearance. It is not a general appearance nor a procedure code, and it avoids sibling observables tied to other glasses. The lack of result descriptors keeps it at the parameter level."
417185000,Dictated operative report (record artifact),Dictated operative report document,"The wording explicitly calls out a document that is a dictated operative report, clearly a record artifact and not a clinical action. Its SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Dictated operative report (417185000) precisely matches the operative report type with the dictation qualifier. Choosing a general Operative report would lose specificity, and siblings like scanned or brief operative notes introduce attributes not stated. Adding 'document' does not change the meaning; it reiterates that this is a record artifact."
270116006,Postmortem report (record artifact),Autopsy report document,"The entry describes the autopsy report as a document, clearly identifying a record artifact. The best SNOMED CT match is Postmortem report (record artifact) SCTID 270116006, since autopsy and postmortem are interchangeable terms in this reporting context. Choosing the autopsy procedure would be incorrect, and broader artifacts like Pathology report lack specificity. No extra qualifiers (e.g., forensic, preliminary/final) are present."
261107004,L11 type (qualifier value),Clinical type L11,"This wording identifies a clinical classification type designated as L11, remaining solely a type qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the specific concept is 'L11 type' (261107004). A parent concept like 'clinical type' would be too broad, and mapping to an L11 disorder would be a misinterpretation. The term 'clinical type' is a context synonym that preserves the qualifier semantics without adding attributes."
217925001,Accident caused by fire starting in or on machinery (event),Accident due to fire originating in or on machinery,"This phrasing conveys the same event: an accident caused by a fire with an origin in/on machinery. The main elements are accident, cause = fire, origin/locus = machinery. SNOMED CT category: Event. The concept aligns precisely with SCTID 217925001, as 'originating' is synonymous with 'starting' and does not introduce new attributes. Broader concepts like general fire-related accidents are less specific, and more specific children identifying other environments would not apply. No additional details (e.g., injury, place, timing) are introduced."
285148002,Attic (environment),Home attic,"“Home attic” denotes the attic of a residence, keeping the focus on the specific environmental location under the roof. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This is still best represented by Attic (environment), SCTID 285148002, rather than a parent concept like Home or Residence, because it targets the exact sub-location. No additional attributes such as timing, cause, or severity are implied."
1220622006,Total replacement of knee joint using knee stem (procedure),Surgical report: stemmed TKA (total knee replacement),"The report indicates a stemmed total knee arthroplasty, also clarified as total knee replacement. This is a SNOMED CT Procedure. 'Stemmed' equates to 'using knee stem,' and 'TKA' is the accepted synonym for total knee arthroplasty. Parent concepts like generic TKA omit the stem attribute, and siblings for partial knee replacements or revisions are not supported by the wording, so the exact stemmed TKA concept is the best fit."
1352662003,Union for International Cancer Control ypT1c1 (qualifier value),Follow-up note references UICC ypT1c1,"This phrase indicates that a follow-up note references the UICC code 'ypT1c1', denoting post-treatment pathologic TNM T classification. The main concept is UICC 'ypT1c1' as a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT. It precisely matches the target concept by specifying UICC and 'ypT1c1'; broader parents or siblings with different prefixes/numerals are excluded. The wording is an equivalent representation that does not add any clinical attributes beyond the staging qualifier."
773093006,Emergency department encounter report (record artifact),Refer to emergency department encounter report,"This entry directs attention to the ED encounter report; the artifact type and setting are explicit. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 773093006 matches the ED encounter report exactly. Broader or alternate artifacts (e.g., ED summary, ED note) are not referenced. The directive 'refer to' is contextual and does not introduce new attributes or change the document type."
736286003,Hypertension clinical management plan (record artifact),Hypertension care plan,"This phrase identifies a care plan specific to hypertension, clearly functioning as a documented plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the correct code is 736286003 because it represents a hypertension clinical management plan rather than the disease or a general care plan. Parent concepts would be too broad, while sibling concepts like pathway or guideline documents imply protocol-level materials that are not indicated here. “Care plan” is a clinically standard synonym for “clinical management plan,” preserving the same code selection."
81388006,Drug additive (product),Pharmaceutical additive component,"This indicates a product component used as an additive in pharmaceutical preparations, with no specific subtype or ingredient named. Main concept: additive component for pharmaceutical products. SNOMED CT category: Product. Drug additive (product) [81388006] is the best match because the entry centers on an additive product to be included in medications. Parent categories are too general, and specific additive subtypes are not mentioned. The synonym does not change the concept scope."
20575005,Structure of vortex of cardiac ventricle (body structure),Vortex within the cardiac ventricle,"The phrasing describes the vortex as an internal feature of a cardiac ventricle, aligning with the intended anatomical structure. There are no attributes indicating side, disease, or temporal details. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 20575005 is most specific for the ventricular vortex. Broader parents would include any part of the ventricle, while siblings refer to other distinct parts like septum or apex. The phrasing is a paraphrase that remains equivalent in meaning."
22414007,Demolition and removal site (environment),Demolition site with removal operations,"This synonym describes an environment where demolition is occurring alongside removal operations, preserving both aspects of the concept and fitting the Environment category with SCTID 22414007. The added phrase 'with removal operations' ensures it does not map to the sibling 'demolition site' alone, and it remains more specific than a generic construction environment."
8415001,Structure of renal surface of adrenal gland (body structure),Suprarenal kidney-facing surface,"Using 'suprarenal' for adrenal and 'kidney-facing surface' for renal surface identifies the same anatomical Body structure. SCTID 8415001 is the exact match. No other surfaces, conditions, or laterality are included, so alternate parent/child/sibling concepts are less suitable. The synonyms are clinically equivalent and do not change code selection."
445418005,Professional allied to medicine clinical report (record artifact),Patient submitted allied health clinical report,"This describes the artifact (allied health clinical report) with context that the patient submitted it; submission does not alter the document type. Category: Record artifact. It aligns with 445418005, specifying allied health authorship without naming a particular discipline or alternative report type. Parents are too broad, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., physiotherapy report, nursing report) are not indicated by this wording."
721964003,Radiology order (record artifact),Radiology study order,"In clinical documentation, ""study"" is synonymous with a radiology exam. The phrase indicates an order (a record artifact). The best-fit SNOMED concept is Radiology order (record artifact) [721964003]. Parent concepts like generic Order (record artifact) omit the radiology domain, while modality-specific children (e.g., MR study order, radiography order) are not supported by the text. It is not a performed procedure nor a report, so sibling concepts like Radiology procedure or Radiology report do not apply."
447955000,Specimen from rectum (specimen),Sample from rectum,"This entry states a sample (synonymous with specimen) and locates its source as the rectum, without method or specimen subtype. It therefore aligns with Specimen from rectum (SCTID 447955000) in the Specimen hierarchy. A parent such as Specimen from gastrointestinal tract would be overly broad, and siblings/children like Rectal swab specimen or Rectal biopsy specimen would be too granular given the lack of type details."
53911000087103,History of amputation of bilateral index fingers (situation),Physical therapy evaluation: reports history of amputation of both index fingers.,"The PT note reports a history, with the amputation involving both index fingers, meeting the criteria for bilaterality and site. This fits the SNOMED CT Situation “History of amputation of bilateral index fingers.” It excludes mapping to active procedures or general finger history. The phrasing is equivalent and introduces no extraneous attributes like etiology or level."
1345213006,Nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery of bilateral eyes (procedure),"Nonpenetrating glaucoma surgical procedure, bilateral","The wording states a nonpenetrating surgical procedure for glaucoma and specifies bilateral laterality. This is a Procedure. It matches Nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery of bilateral eyes exactly. Parent or unspecified laterality concepts are less precise, and unilateral siblings do not apply. No subtype like canaloplasty is introduced, so SCTID 1345213006 is appropriate."
310103007,Hospital-based speech and language therapy service (qualifier value),Hospital speech and language therapy service referral destination,"The central concept is a speech and language therapy service in the hospital setting; 'referral destination' is contextual. This is a Qualifier value, and SCTID 310103007 precisely matches the hospital-based SLT service. More general service qualifiers would omit the hospital context, and other-setting qualifiers would miscode the service location. No additional attributes are present."
224679003,Rehabilitation hostel (environment),Patient-reported environment: rehabilitation hostel,"This entry adds documentation perspective ('patient-reported') while the core concept is the environment: rehabilitation hostel, aligning with SCTID 224679003. No additional attributes that alter meaning (e.g., time frame or cause) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The environment specified is more precise than a generic hostel and avoids confusing with rehabilitation hospitals or centers (siblings). The 'patient-reported' tag does not change the environment concept; it simply indicates source of information and is not part of the coded semantics."
165224005,Independent feeding (finding),Eats without assistance,"“Eats without assistance” conveys that the patient requires no help to perform feeding, aligning with independence in the feeding ADL. Concept: independent feeding. Category: Clinical finding. The correct code is SNOMED CT 165224005. A general feeding finding or independence in other self-care areas are too broad, and assisted or modified independence concepts would not fit the explicit lack of assistance; the paraphrase remains semantically equivalent."
20521000284106,Golden yellow color (qualifier value),Hue noted as golden yellow,"This states the hue is 'golden yellow' and contains no modifiers (intensity, timing, cause). The concept is purely a color descriptor used as a qualifier. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The precise match is SCTID 20521000284106; parents like general 'yellow' are broader, and siblings such as 'gold' or 'amber' differ chromatically. The wording is a synonymous phrasing of the same qualifier value."
50152008,Structure of plexus impar of thyroid (body structure),Anatomy noted: thyroid gland impar plexus,"“Anatomy noted” provides documentation context without altering the specific anatomical target, the thyroid gland’s impar plexus. That maps directly to SNOMED CT 50152008 (Body structure). The entry remains neutral with respect to type or function, preserving exactness and avoiding parent generalization or child overspecification. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym."
1306654001,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with full smile and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),"Record entry: photographic extraoral left 45° view of left half of face, full smile, centric relation of jaws.","The record entry specifies a photographic extraoral image of the left half of the face at 45°, with full smile and jaws in centric relation—exactly matching SCTID 1306654001 under Record artifact. The wording retains all critical attributes. Parent artifacts would not capture the detailed view and jaw position, and sibling concepts that differ in side or occlusal relationship would not correctly represent this artifact."
242861006,Assault by poisoning with bleach (event),Assault involving poisoning with bleach,"The entry states an assault involving poisoning with bleach, capturing the intentional event and the agent. Main concepts: assault and bleaching poisoning. Category: Event. It fits 242861006 exactly. Parent assault codes lack mechanism, and sibling codes for accidental poisoning or self-harm are excluded by the 'assault' phrasing. The term is a clear paraphrase of the preferred concept."
768689003,Product containing fluorine and/or fluorine compound (product),Fluorinated product,"“Fluorinated product” signifies that the product has fluorine incorporated, maintaining focus on product composition without specifying type or use. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 768689003 is the appropriate code because it covers products that contain fluorine or fluorine compounds. A general parent like Product omits the fluorine detail, and specific children such as Fluorinated anesthetic product or Fluorocarbon-containing product impose specifics not present. “Fluorinated” is an acceptable synonym indicating the presence of fluorine, so the concept selection remains unchanged."
716487003,Difficulty using pragmatics in communication (finding),Challenges in the social use of language,"The statement describes a Clinical finding where the person experiences challenges in the social (pragmatic) use of language during communication. This is semantically equivalent to Difficulty using pragmatics in communication and fits SNOMED CT 716487003. The synonym “challenges” conveys difficulty without changing attributes. Parent concepts like general language difficulty are too broad, and disorder-level or highly specific pragmatic subskill concepts are too narrow for this general pragmatic-use difficulty."
223892006,North Yorkshire (geographic location),"North Yorkshire, England","The concept expressed is North Yorkshire with an explicit parent region clarifier (England). This remains a Geographic location, and the most accurate code is North Yorkshire (SCTID 223892006). The phrase does not introduce an attribute beyond the higher-level geographic context. Coding England alone would be too broad, and coding any subcounty area would be too narrow. The addition of ""England"" does not change the target location; it simply situates the same county within its country."
279889000,Entire transverse cervical ligament (body structure),Mackenrodt’s ligament of the uterus,"Mackenrodt’s ligament is a well-accepted synonym for the transverse cervical (cardinal) ligament, and the uterine qualifier removes ambiguity. Category: Body structure. The entry represents the entire anatomical ligament, making 'Entire transverse cervical ligament' (SCTID: 279889000) the exact match. Parent concepts are too broad, and children introducing laterality or subdivisions are narrower than stated. Siblings like uterosacral or round ligaments are not semantically equivalent. The synonym preserves clinical meaning without adding attributes such as disease, laterality, or condition."
695791010000103,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Enterobacter cloacae (substance),Genetic material—Bacillus cloacae DNA,"The phrase specifies the genetic material and constrains it to DNA of Bacillus cloacae, not RNA or unspecified nucleic acid, and does not add detection or procedural attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 695791010000103 is the exact organism-specific DNA concept. Broader parent concepts like generic DNA or organism-only concepts are less precise, and siblings referring to different organisms or to RNA would be incorrect. ‘Genetic material’ here is clarified by ‘DNA,’ maintaining equivalence."
1187492002,Island in region of Territory of Norfolk Island (geographic location),Island in region of Territory of Norfolk Island,"The main concept expressed is a geographic location: an island that lies within the region of the Territory of Norfolk Island. No additional attributes such as time, severity, or causation are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This wording matches precisely the concept 'Island in region of Territory of Norfolk Island' and is neither broader (e.g., the territory as a whole) nor narrower (e.g., a specific named island like Norfolk Island, Phillip Island, or Nepean Island). It is also more specific than the generic parent 'Island (geographic location)' because it constrains the location to the Norfolk Island territory region."
473306006,Assessment using Addenbrooke's cognitive examination revised attention and orientation subscale (procedure),Documentation: ACE-R attention/orientation domain assessment,"This documentation entry records assessment of the ACE-R attention/orientation domain, i.e., the subscale. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It precisely matches 473306006 by naming the ACE-R A&O domain and avoids mapping to the full ACE-R or other domains. “Domain assessment” is a synonym for subscale administration without altering scope or adding attributes."
368757005,Entire right submaxillary gland (body structure),Entire right submandibular gland,"Main concept: the whole submandibular (submaxillary) salivary gland on the right side. Attributes explicitly present are laterality (right) and scope (entire gland). SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The most precise match is 'Entire right submaxillary gland (body structure)' SCTID 368757005, which models the complete right submandibular gland. Parent concepts such as 'Submandibular gland (body structure)' lack laterality, and sibling concepts like 'Structure of right submandibular gland' do not guarantee the whole organ. Child concepts that refer to parts (e.g., duct or lobe) are excluded by the term 'entire'. 'Submandibular' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'submaxillary' and does not change code selection."
18807009,Oxalis corniculata (organism),Procumbent yellow woodsorrel (Oxalis corniculata),"The entry uses a common name paired with the scientific name, with 'procumbent yellow woodsorrel' being a recognized common synonym for Oxalis corniculata. The main concept is an organism at the species level. Within SNOMED CT, the most specific code is Oxalis corniculata (organism), SCTID 18807009. Using a broader parent like Oxalis genus or choosing a sibling species would be incorrect, as the binomial explicitly specifies corniculata. The synonym reflects the same taxon and does not add clinical attributes, keeping the code selection unchanged."
434244002,Specimen from retroperitoneum obtained by biopsy (specimen),Pathology specimen—retroperitoneum biopsy,"This entry is a pathology-facing label stating that the specimen is from the retroperitoneum and obtained via biopsy. The main concept is a specimen, appropriate for the SNOMED CT Specimen category. It matches the target concept because both origin and acquisition method are specified. It avoids procedural coding (no documentation of performing the biopsy) and does not introduce narrower techniques or other attributes. Thus, parent or sibling concepts with less or more specificity are not better matches."
167750006,Cerebrospinal fluid globulin above reference range (finding),LP report: CSF globulin above normal,"This states in an LP (lumbar puncture) report that CSF globulin is above normal, i.e., above reference range. Main concept: elevated CSF globulin. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. It maps to SCTID 167750006 because it specifies globulin in CSF as high. It does not refer to total protein or albumin, nor to specific immunoglobulins, which would be different concepts."
19202001,Clumped (qualifier value),Radiology report comment: clumped,"Within a radiology reporting context, the descriptor remains ‘clumped,’ which is the Qualifier value Clumped (SCTID: 19202001). The category is Qualifier value; no ancillary attributes (cause, severity, timing, laterality) are added. Parent concepts would be overly broad, and sibling descriptors differ semantically. The explicit use of ‘clumped’ supports selecting 19202001."
112628005,Split shape (qualifier value),Shape: split,"This documentation-style line defines the shape explicitly as “split.” The concept is a qualitative attribute of shape, not a finding or disorder. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value, best matched by Split shape (112628005). A parent concept like Shape would be nonspecific, and other shape descriptors (e.g., cleft, branched) would not match the wording. The entry adds no other attributes or entities, ensuring it maps uniquely to the split shape qualifier."
442763004,Measurement of chloride in 24 hour stool specimen (procedure),Cl- measured in 24-hour feces specimen,"Using the chemical symbol Cl- for chloride, this entry describes measuring chloride in a feces (stool) specimen collected over 24 hours, preserving the required attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 442763004 is the exact match due to analyte chloride, stool/fecal specimen, and the 24-hour collection. A broader stool chloride measurement without timing or a different analyte would miscode. The symbol “Cl-” and the term “feces” are standard synonyms for chloride and stool."
66280005,Private home-based care (environment),Environment of care: patient's private home,"The entry conveys that the environment in which care occurs is the patient's private home, emphasizing both care and the private residence context. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This maps to 66280005, as it is not merely a location but the care setting. Choosing Private residence (environment) would miss the care aspect, and selecting Home-based care (environment) would be less specific because the private qualifier is stated here."
264030008,In joint (qualifier value),Within the joint,"The wording describes a location that is within a joint, i.e., intra-articular. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It fits 264030008 because it only specifies the spatial context; there is no condition, procedure, or route referenced. Alternatives like joint structure (body structure) would be incorrect because this entry functions as a qualifier, not a structure."
1345134005,Caregiver unable to cope (situation),Caregiver reports being unable to cope,"This patient-reported style entry still states the core concept: the caregiver is unable to cope. The explicit content maps to the Situation concept Caregiver unable to cope (1345134005). The reporting context does not alter the meaning or add attributes. Alternatives like caregiver strain or stress would be inaccurate because the statement expresses an outright inability, not just pressure or burden."
182328005,Structure of surface of lateral region of neck (body structure),Surface of lateral cervical neck region,"By explicitly stating 'surface' and tying 'cervical' to 'neck' and 'lateral region,' this entry denotes the same anatomical site as SNOMED CT 182328005 (Body structure). The inclusion of 'surface' prevents mapping to the sibling 'lateral region of neck' and the 'lateral region' prevents mapping to the parent 'surface of neck.' The wording adds no laterality or condition, making it an accurate synonymic representation of the target concept."
429182007,Revision of percutaneous intradiscal thermocoagulation of cervical intervertebral disc using radiofrequency probe (procedure),Procedure performed: revision percutaneous intradiscal RF thermocoagulation of the cervical disc,"This statement documents that the procedure performed was a revision of percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation targeting the cervical disc. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The presence of 'revision,' 'percutaneous,' 'intradiscal,' 'RF,' and 'cervical disc' ensures an exact match to SCTID 429182007. Parent/sibling concepts that lack revision status, cervical specificity, or RF device would not align properly with the described procedure."
45539000,Succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) (substance),Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone),"This describes the ubiquinone-dependent succinate dehydrogenase enzyme located in mitochondria, which is intrinsic to the identity of this substance and maps to SNOMED CT 45539000 (Substance). The entry remains focused on the enzyme entity and does not add findings, results, or subunit details. Broader or different concepts like generic 'mitochondrial complex II' without specifying succinate dehydrogenase or subunit-specific proteins would be less precise. The mitochondrial reference is consistent with the enzyme's identity and does not change the coding."
285154001,Railway cutting (environment),Scene: railway cutting,"‘Scene’ labels the setting and specifies it as a railway cutting, a defined environmental feature. This belongs to the Environment category. The correct code is SCTID 285154001 Railway cutting (environment). Choosing a parent concept would reduce specificity, and sibling concepts such as railway platform or tunnel would mischaracterize the setting. The contextual word 'Scene' does not add causal or temporal attributes; it strictly frames the environment for accurate mapping."
223872004,Cumbria (geographic location),Place name: Cumbria,"The entry identifies the place name as Cumbria; the main concept is the geographic location. No clinical qualifiers or relational attributes beyond the context label are present. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223872004 corresponds directly to Cumbria. Broader areas (England/UK) or narrower localities (e.g., Lake District) would not match the text. The wording is a straightforward identification of the same location."
1365793002,Photographic extraoral image of face with mouth open (record artifact),"EMR image: extraoral facial photo, mouth open.","This notes an EMR image that is an extraoral facial photo with mouth open, matching SCTID 1365793002. Category: Record artifact. The context of EMR does not change the artifact’s nature; the explicit mouth-open attribute ensures selection of this specific concept rather than the parent. No additional attributes are added that would shift coding to siblings (e.g., intraoral) or children with specific views."
722735002,Structure of bone of left calcaneum (body structure),Left calcaneus bone,"This wording unambiguously refers to the bone of the left calcaneus. Category: Body structure. It maps directly to SNOMED CT 722735002 as it indicates osseous tissue and left laterality, with no mention of pathology, procedure, or subparts. A parent concept such as “left calcaneus” (without specifying bone) could be broader, and children (e.g., cortical/trabecular bone of the left calcaneus) are not intended. The phrase is a straightforward clinical synonym for the preferred concept."
1156193004,Housing instability due to frequent change in place of residence (finding),Housing instability linked to frequent change of place of residence.,"Main concept: housing instability linked causally to frequent change of residence. Category: Clinical finding. Justification: The wording matches SCTID 1156193004, which requires both the instability and the specified cause. ‘Linked to’ conveys causality consistent with ‘due to.’ It would be less appropriate to code to the parent without the cause or to a sibling that only notes frequent residence change without instability."
246437005,Number of fetuses reduced to (observable entity),Reduced-to fetal number,"The wording captures the observable element that expresses the number to which the fetal count has been reduced, without stating the actual number. The main concept is the target/resultant count after reduction; the explicit attribute is the reduced-to qualifier. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 246437005 is exact because it represents the property of the number of fetuses reduced to. Using a parent like “Number of fetuses” would omit the reduction qualifier, and a sibling indicating “number of fetuses reduced” (removed) would misrepresent the meaning. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent, not altering code selection."
280390001,Excisional biopsy of hypophysis (procedure),Excision biopsy of pituitary,"The term 'excision biopsy' is a clinically standard synonym for 'excisional biopsy,' and 'pituitary' unambiguously identifies the hypophysis. This is a Procedure and aligns exactly with SCTID 280390001. Concepts for non-excisional biopsy or total pituitary excision are not suitable because the entry clearly indicates a biopsy by excision, not a full organ removal or a different biopsy technique."
879871005,Estimated intake of fluid in 24 hours (observable entity),Monitor: estimated 24-hour fluid intake,"This monitoring instruction names the observable to be tracked: an estimated fluid intake over 24 hours. Main concept: fluid intake; qualifier: estimated; timeframe: 24 hours. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 879871005 is the precise code. Parent concepts lacking duration or non-estimated variants are less suitable, and siblings that include output, balance, or route are not implied. The imperative 'Monitor' provides context and does not change the underlying observable."
728878008,Entire ventriculopulmonary junction (body structure),Ventricular–pulmonary artery junction,"The phrase describes the junction between the ventricular chamber and the pulmonary artery, synonymous with the ventriculopulmonary junction. It is a Body structure and most precisely maps to Entire ventriculopulmonary junction (728878008). The use of 'ventricular' rather than 'ventricle' is a harmless lexical variant and does not change the anatomical referent. Choosing a broader ventriculoarterial junction concept would include the aortic side, which is not intended here."
55658008,Hot object (physical object),Hot object reported,"The entry conveys a report of an object characterized as hot, with no further attributes. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It precisely matches Hot object (physical object) [55658008]. Parent concepts are overly broad, and sibling concepts (heat source, hot surface) are not suggested. Reporting context does not introduce new attributes affecting code selection."
130629001,Immunoglobulin A-specific serine endopeptidase (substance),The substance is an IgA-specific serine endopeptidase,"This phrase affirms the substance identity as a serine endopeptidase specific for IgA. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the exact code is Immunoglobulin A-specific serine endopeptidase (SCTID 130629001). A parent like “serine endopeptidase” lacks IgA specificity, and siblings that alter the catalytic type or add source information would misrepresent the concept. The wording is a contextual statement that retains the same biochemical meaning."
421638001,Pennsylvania (geographic location),Pennsylvania (the Commonwealth),"This variant uses the common formal descriptor for the state while still signifying the geographic entity, mapping to Pennsylvania (geographic location), SCTID 421638001. Category: Geographic location (Location). It does not refer to administrative bodies or governmental functions here; it is a synonym for the state. No broader or narrower geographic concept is implied."
49341000119108,History of thrombocytopenia (situation),Hematology consult: documented history of thrombocytopenia,"The entry states that the hematology consult notes a documented past occurrence of thrombocytopenia. The context is historical, making this a Situation with explicit context. 'History of thrombocytopenia (situation)' is the most precise match. Choosing 'Thrombocytopenia (disorder)' would misrepresent the time context as current. No etiologic subtype or severity is implied, so more specific child concepts are not warranted."
49926000,Light emitted by the sun (physical force),Sunlight recorded as the illumination,"Recording the illumination as sunlight denotes light emitted by the sun, mapping precisely to Light emitted by the sun (physical force). The main concept is solar light; record-keeping context does not add attributes like severity or timing. The category is Physical force. Parent Light (physical force) is too broad, and sibling concepts related to UV or non-visible radiation are not indicated. The entry remains equivalent to ‘sunlight’ and supports the same code."
257663006,Prairie (environment),Prairie setting,"This entry denotes the environmental setting and names it as prairie. Within SNOMED CT, this is an Environment or geographical location, best represented by Prairie (environment). The term “setting” does not add attributes like exposure, cause, or temporality; it simply indicates context, avoiding broader concepts like grassland or different environments like savanna or steppe."
170673005,Gastrointestinal tract treatment changed (situation),GI treatment changed.,"This concise problem-list style phrase conveys a change in treatment with clear GI system context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It maps precisely to Gastrointestinal tract treatment changed (SCTID 170673005) because 'GI' is a common abbreviation for 'gastrointestinal' and the concept centers on a changed treatment. A generic Treatment changed would be too broad, and specifying medication or procedures would be too narrow, neither of which is present here. The abbreviation does not introduce new attributes and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
712786008,Tilletia tritici diagnostic allergen extract (product),Tilletia tritici diagnostic allergen extract record,"Even though 'record' suggests documentation context, the codable concept is the product: Tilletia tritici diagnostic allergen extract. This is a SNOMED CT Product concept. SCTID 712786008 is the most precise mapping because it captures both the organism and diagnostic use. Parent concepts are insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts such as therapeutic extracts or allergen substances do not match the product and diagnostic purpose indicated. The contextual term does not add clinical attributes."
432383002,Specimen from spleen obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Biopsy specimen (FNA) of spleen,This indicates a biopsy specimen of the spleen obtained specifically by FNA. It is categorized as a Specimen and corresponds to SCTID 432383002 because both the site (spleen) and method (fine-needle aspiration biopsy) are present. The parentheses clarify the technique without adding unrelated attributes. Broader parents lacking the method and siblings without site are less precise. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to the preferred term.
105427007,Divorced parents (family) (social concept),Parents are divorced,"The statement conveys the stable social context that the patient's parents are divorced, with no additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Social concept. This is best coded as “Divorced parents (family)” (SCTID 105427007), reflecting family status rather than a personal marital status for the patient or an event. It does not introduce timing, custody, or living arrangements, and is not better represented by related concepts like separation or single-parent household. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent synonym."
411577005,Chinchilla epithelium diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergen diagnostic extract from chinchilla epithelium,"The entry specifies a diagnostic allergen extract and clearly states the source as chinchilla epithelium, indicating a product for allergy testing. It falls under the Product category and matches SNOMED CT 411577005. Parent concepts such as general animal allergen extracts or chinchilla allergen extracts without source detail are less precise, and sibling concepts focused on therapeutic use or other tissues are excluded."
726565008,Past pregnancy history of small for gestational age baby (situation),Has had a small-for-gestational-age baby before,"A patient-oriented phrasing that clearly indicates a prior SGA baby ('before') establishes a past obstetric context. The main concepts are previous pregnancy and small-for-gestational-age baby; no extra attributes are introduced. This is a Situation category entry and best maps to SCTID 726565008, which encodes past pregnancy history of an SGA infant. It is not a generic history (parent) and does not imply siblings such as preterm birth or low birth weight. The language is an equivalent synonym and does not change code selection."
434910001,Interstitial fluid glucose concentration (observable entity),Lab/POC parameter: interstitial fluid glucose concentration,"The entry describes a laboratory/point-of-care parameter, but the clinical concept is the observable property of glucose concentration in interstitial fluid. It fits the Observable entity category and corresponds exactly to Interstitial fluid glucose concentration (SCTID 434910001). It avoids additional attributes such as numeric results, timing, or abnormality. Parent concepts without matrix designation are too broad, and sibling concepts naming different matrices (blood/plasma/serum) are not applicable, confirming SCTID 434910001."
328696007,Gluten-free savory biscuits (product),Stock item: gluten-free savory biscuits,"This indicates inventory context without changing the product itself, which is gluten-free savory biscuits. SNOMED CT category: Product. The entry maintains the essential attributes and avoids additional qualifiers. Parent concepts are too general without the gluten-free aspect; sibling concepts differ in taste or form. The best match remains Gluten-free savory biscuits (product), SCTID 328696007."
1304043009,Colonoscopy and suturing of colon (procedure),Colonoscope-guided suturing of colon,"By stating the suturing was guided by a colonoscope, the entry implicitly confirms a colonoscopy and the act of colonic suturing, matching 1304043009. Category: Procedure. This does not introduce extra interventions or targets beyond the colon, excluding siblings like sigmoidoscopy-based procedures. 'Guided' does not create a different code; it fits the combined colonoscopy-and-suturing procedure."
309991001,Pediatric surgical department (environment),Dept. of pediatric surgery,"The abbreviation 'Dept.' still clearly indicates a department, explicitly of pediatric surgery, which is the same environment as pediatric surgical department. No scope modifiers are present. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Environment concept 309991001. Using a parent like surgical department or pediatric department would be less specific, and sibling concepts (ward, unit, service) are not appropriate given the explicit departmental designation. The abbreviated form is a common documentation synonym and does not alter code selection."
54899006,Stereotactic excisional biopsy of intracranial lesion (procedure),Operative: Stereotactic excisional biopsy of intracranial lesion,"Documented in an operative note style, the core concept remains the same: a stereotactic excisional biopsy targeting an intracranial lesion. This is a Procedure and fits SNOMED CT 54899006 exactly. The entry does not introduce timing, laterality, or technique variants; it excludes non-excisional approaches (e.g., needle/incisional) and avoids broader non-stereotactic categories."
714543007,"Dental bone matrix implant, metallic (physical object)",Dental metallic bone matrix implant,"The entry maintains the essential elements: dental context, bone matrix implant, and metallic material. Category: Physical object. It matches SNOMED CT 714543007. Word order does not change the meaning, and material is specified. Broader objects without material or other dental device types would be incorrect. It avoids any suggestion of placement or clinical status, maintaining proper mapping to the object concept."
70321000119108,History of yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser iridotomy (situation),History: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser iridotomy,"This succinctly documents a history of yttrium‑aluminum‑garnet (YAG) laser iridotomy, with no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 70321000119108 is the exact code for history of YAG laser iridotomy. Broader history-of-procedure concepts or non-YAG iridotomy history would be less specific, and other YAG procedures are not appropriate. The full name is a direct synonym for YAG and maintains coding equivalence."
285332009,Green light (physical force),Green light,"The entry names the single physical phenomenon of green light. The main medical concept is the physical force 'green light,' with no added attributes such as source, exposure, or therapeutic use. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. 'Green light' is the most precise match to SCTID 285332009, which is specifically the green portion of visible light. More general parents like 'Light (physical force)' or 'Visible light (physical force)' are less specific, and siblings such as 'Blue light' or 'Red light' would be incorrect. No device (e.g., laser) or event context is introduced, so child or sibling concepts are not implicated."
366122007,Finding of movement of trachea (finding),Tracheal movement noted,"The entry explicitly documents the presence of movement of the trachea. This is a Clinical finding and aligns directly with SNOMED CT 366122007 (Finding of movement of trachea). No additional attributes such as direction, severity, timing, or etiology are introduced. Parent concepts like general tracheal findings would be less precise, and child/sibling concepts such as tracheal deviation or tracheal tug specify a particular type of movement, which is not stated here. The straightforward phrasing ensures the most specific match to the movement finding without altering the code selection."
450733005,Rockall score (observable entity),Rockall risk score used for risk stratification,"The phrase describes utilization of the patient’s Rockall risk score, a synonym that does not alter the code selection. No numeric value or phase of scoring is specified; thus Rockall score (observable entity) SCTID 450733005 is the precise match. It does not point to pre-endoscopy or complete variants, nor to other scores like Glasgow-Blatchford."
257580000,Recreational vehicle park (environment),Caravan park,"In many regions, 'caravan' is the standard term for RVs; 'caravan park' is semantically equivalent to an RV park environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 257580000 precisely captures this environment. Broader concepts like recreational area or campground are not specific enough, and 'campsite' would be narrower (child-like), while 'trailer park' refers to permanent mobile homes and is a different sibling. No extra attributes are included."
31846006,Medium rales (finding),Documented medium rales on physical exam,"The entry documents medium rales identified during physical examination, a Clinical finding. SCTID 31846006 is the correct code because it specifically represents medium rales. The inclusion of exam context does not introduce new attributes (e.g., location, timing, severity). Parent concepts for general rales lack the specified medium quality, and sibling concepts (fine or coarse rales) would not match the documented medium characteristic."
396192007,Fuhrman nuclear grading system (staging scale),Fuhrman grading system (nuclear),"The qualifier 'nuclear' clarifies that the Fuhrman grading system in question is the nuclear grading scale, aligning with the named staging scale. SNOMED CT category: Staging scale (assessment scale). It matches 396192007 because it denotes the scale itself, not a measurement or grade outcome. Generic nuclear grade observables or findings would be inappropriate, and specific grade values are absent. The synonym structure remains clinically equivalent and does not add attributes."
736391004,Hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient plan of care for hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery.,"This denotes a plan of care document created for hospitalized patients under the hepato-pancreato-biliary surgical service. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 736391004 matches precisely, as it is the inpatient care plan for hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery. A parent such as Care plan or a sibling such as outpatient care plan would be less suitable; the inpatient setting is explicitly stated and no other phase or context is introduced. The phrasing uses a standard synonym for the specialty."
1269013002,Esomeprazole magnesium anhydrous (substance),The salt present is esomeprazole magnesium anhydrous,This sentence specifies the exact salt form and hydration state: the anhydrous magnesium salt of esomeprazole. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It matches SCTID 1269013002 by explicitly naming the salt and anhydrous condition. Parent concepts that omit salt/hydration and siblings with different hydrates or counter-ions would be inaccurate. No additional clinical or product attributes are introduced.
5080006,Increased barometric pressure (physical force),Barometric pressure elevated,"This documentation-style phrasing asserts that barometric pressure is elevated, i.e., above baseline. The concept type is Physical force, and Increased barometric pressure (physical force) [5080006] is the exact match. It remains focused on the force itself without suggesting outcomes (e.g., barotrauma), events (exposure), or environments (hyperbaric chamber). Generic parent concepts would be less specific, and opposite-state siblings (decreased) do not fit the wording."
391166004,Urine lysergic acid diethylamide screening test (procedure),Urine toxicology: LSD screening,"This indicates a toxicology screening for LSD using urine as the specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It corresponds to SCTID 391166004 because it identifies urine as the sample and LSD as the analyte with a screening purpose. More general parents such as urine toxicology screen without specifying the analyte or specimen-unspecified LSD screening are less precise. The entry does not suggest confirmatory methodology or quantitative analysis, avoiding sibling codes. The term 'LSD' is equivalent to lysergic acid diethylamide."
161124006,Boarding school (environment),Boarding school environment,"This phrasing identifies the environment as a boarding school and aligns with the SNOMED CT semantic tag (environment). No additional attributes are introduced. Compared with broader parents like 'School (environment),' specifying 'boarding' ensures the precise SCTID 161124006 is appropriate. It does not imply a different location type such as 'Dormitory' or a non-residential 'Day school,' so sibling concepts are less accurate."
118501000119105,History of drug-induced anaphylaxis (situation),Recorded history of medication-associated anaphylaxis,"This entry states that the record reflects a past anaphylaxis event associated with medication, thus portraying the historical nature and drug etiology. It aligns with the Situation concept “History of drug-induced anaphylaxis.” A broader history of anaphylaxis would lose the medication association, and specifying a particular drug would be overly narrow. The synonym “medication-associated” is equivalent to “drug-induced,” maintaining the same coding intent."
406551008,Social assessment (procedure),Social situation evaluation,"This phrase expresses an evaluative procedure focused on the patient's social situation, equivalent to social assessment. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 406551008 is most precise. Concepts such as Taking social history (procedure) emphasize historical data collection rather than evaluative assessment, and Psychosocial assessment (procedure) adds psychological components not present in the statement."
184757008,Shotgun application certification - fee paid (finding),GP correspondence: shotgun certificate application fee paid,"A GP correspondence entry states the shotgun certificate application fee is paid. Concept: fee paid finding tied to shotgun certification application; attribute: paid. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 184757008 is the most specific match. Using 'certificate' for 'certification' is synonymous in this context, and no additional attributes (e.g., approval, issuance) are implied, avoiding parent or sibling concepts."
469331002,"Internal defibrillator electrode, adult (physical object)",Replacement ordered—adult internal defibrillator electrode,"This is an order entry for the specific device: an adult internal defibrillation electrode. Main concept: internal defibrillator electrode; attribute: adult. Category: Physical object. The ordering context does not introduce procedural or presence-of concepts; it simply identifies the object being procured. The adult qualifier makes the adult-specific electrode the most precise match; the parent concept omits age and would be less accurate. Sibling concepts such as external electrodes, pacing leads, or generators are not referenced by the term."
284332004,Does put one object inside another (finding),Inserts one object within another,"The entry describes insertion of one object into another, which is semantically equivalent to putting one object inside another. The main concept is a functional Clinical finding, mapping to SCTID 284332004. There are no added attributes such as type of objects, developmental age, or outcome, keeping it precise. Broader or alternative behaviors (e.g., stacking or aligning objects) are not mentioned, and more specific contexts (e.g., cups or boxes) are avoided, making this the most accurate match."
467445003,Bound solute dialysis system application software (physical object),Bound solute dialysis system software application,"Reordering “software application” preserves the concept: application software specific to the bound solute dialysis system. The main concept is the same physical object class of software. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It fits SCTID 467445003 because it uniquely signals a software application targeted to this specific system type. Parent concepts that omit the bound solute qualifier are too general, and sibling entities such as system hardware or operating systems do not match because this describes an application layer, not physical machinery or base system software."
729628004,Entire subhyaloid region (body structure),Entire subhyaloid region,"This entry explicitly matches the preferred term and scope of SCTID 729628004, representing the whole of the subhyaloid region as an anatomical structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The phrase includes no additional attributes and therefore does not suggest a child concept (such as laterality or subparts) nor a parent (e.g., general ocular regions). It avoids sibling constructs like a named space or adjacent retinal regions, making this the most precise match."
252366003,Peripheral blood lymphocyte cross-match (procedure),Peripheral blood lymphocyte crossmatch—procedure,"This explicitly labels the item as a procedure and identifies it as a crossmatch of peripheral blood lymphocytes, which is a Procedure best coded as Peripheral blood lymphocyte cross-match (SCTID 252366003). No method, result, timing, donor/recipient role, or lymphocyte subset attributes are introduced, ensuring it does not map to generic crossmatch or technique-specific children. The dash and descriptor are stylistic and do not change the clinical meaning."
305040007,Structure of peroneus tertius tendon sheath (body structure),Fibularis tertius tendon sheath,"This entry identifies the tendon sheath of fibularis tertius, using “fibularis” as the clinically accepted synonym for “peroneus.” No extraneous attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and the exact match is “Structure of peroneus tertius tendon sheath” SCTID 305040007. Parent concepts like generic tendon sheaths are too broad, and sibling concepts such as fibularis (peroneus) longus or brevis tendon sheaths do not match the tertius specification. The synonym “fibularis tertius” is clinically equivalent to “peroneus tertius” and does not alter code selection."
450358002,Assessment using benign prostatic hyperplasia impact index (procedure),BPH Impact Index assessment completed,"Completion of the BPH Impact Index assessment indicates that the procedure of administering the specific instrument occurred. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure; the specific concept is 'Assessment using benign prostatic hyperplasia impact index' (450358002). The wording avoids any score values or references to other scales, excluding parent or sibling concepts. 'Assessment completed' is a standard synonym for the procedural act."
1193628003,"Island in region of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (geographic location)","Follow-up planned on an island in the region of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba","While the sentence indicates follow-up context, the coded entity is the geographic location: an island within the BES region. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The concept matches SCTID 1193628003, being more specific than the parent Island (geographic location) and less specific than named child islands. It clearly is not the region itself, so sibling region concepts are inappropriate. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
881009,Cyclodialysis (procedure),Ophthalmic procedure: cyclodialysis,"The concept is an ophthalmic surgical procedure explicitly named as cyclodialysis, without additional modifiers. This places it in the Procedure category and matches SCTID 881009. A parent concept like ophthalmic procedure alone would be too general, and sibling operations are not referenced. Including 'ophthalmic procedure' provides contextual classification but does not introduce attributes that would change the code selection."
394885002,Parents do not smoke (situation),Parental smoking status documented as non-smoker.,"This entry expresses that the recorded parental smoking status is non-smoker, without specifying past use or environment. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 394885002 is the best match, encoding parents do not smoke. Selecting patient-level non-smoker or household exposure concepts would be incorrect. The term “non-smoker” in the parental status context is synonymous with parents do not smoke and does not introduce new attributes."
223690000,Belize (geographic location),Belize—place name,"The entry names Belize and indicates it is a place name, reinforcing the geographic reference. Main concept: Belize as a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Qualifier value). The descriptor “place name” does not add clinical or contextual attributes; it preserves focus on the country rather than any sublocation or regional parent, supporting SCTID 223690000."
217919000,Accidentally crushed by machinery (event),Documented accidental machinery crush.,"A documented accidental crush involving machinery is an exact expression of the SNOMED event concept 217919000. The entry avoids additional attributes such as injury type, site, or place of occurrence, supporting the event-level coding. Broader machinery accident events or different mechanism siblings (struck, cut) are less accurate. The synonymic phrase maintains equivalence and does not alter specificity."
364065007,Distribution of ventilation:perfusion (observable entity),Distribution of ventilation–perfusion,"The phrase explicitly denotes the distribution characteristic of ventilation relative to perfusion, which is an observable lung parameter. This corresponds directly to SNOMED CT “Distribution of ventilation:perfusion” (364065007). It does not add findings, measurement procedures, or results. Parent or broader observables would be less precise, and children or siblings focused solely on ventilation distribution or perfusion distribution would be incomplete, while ratio-based entities are conceptually different. Therefore, the observable entity code is the most accurate match."
788009005,Nuclear medicine service (qualifier value),Service line: nuclear medicine,"The phrase identifies the service line as nuclear medicine, which is a service classification and not a test or an organizational unit. The precise SNOMED CT match is the Qualifier value Nuclear medicine service (788009005). Broader labels (e.g., diagnostic services) or specific nuclear medicine procedures would be inappropriate because the entry contains no procedural or departmental attributes. 'Service line' is a contextual synonym for the service-type designation."
325911001,Entire cavernous nerves of penis (body structure),Nervi cavernosi penis (entire),"This entry uses the Latin anatomical name “nervi cavernosi penis” and explicitly denotes “entire,” indicating the full set. The main concept is the named anatomical nerve group for the penis, with no added attributes like laterality or pathology. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It most precisely matches 325911001 because it expresses the entire named structure in the penis. The parent concept would be less definitive (could represent part-of), while children such as specific sides or branches are not intended. The Latin synonym is clinically equivalent to the English term and preserves the same code selection without introducing new attributes."
264353000,Fairground (environment),Fairground setting,"The entry conveys that the setting is a fairground, focusing on the environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It is not a general recreational area or a different venue type like a theme park, so the precise match is Fairground (environment) with SCTID 264353000."
710176006,Lovage (substance),Garden lovage (substance),"“Garden lovage” is a common name for Levisticum officinale and the addition of “(substance)” makes clear the intended SNOMED CT Substance concept. The main concept is the lovage substance without any extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This best matches Lovage (substance) 710176006; it does not point to the organism class or to a prepared product (e.g., oil or extract), so parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate."
408505004,Child 7 month examination not wanted (situation),7‑month child exam not wanted.,"This phrasing conveys the same situation: the 7‑month examination for a child is not wanted. The core attributes are the child’s age‑specific exam (7 months) and the status “not wanted.” It is a Situation concept. It is the most precise match to “Child 7 month examination not wanted” because both the examination and the 7‑month timing are present. Parent concepts that omit the age are too general, and sibling or child concepts like “refused exam,” “not attended,” or different ages are less appropriate. Using “exam” as a synonym for “examination” is clinically equivalent and does not change the code selection."
429401008,Image guided balloon dilation of colorectal stricture (procedure),Colorectal stricture balloon dilation with image guidance,"This entry describes a Procedure: balloon dilation applied to a colorectal stricture and performed with image guidance, which corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT concept 429401008. The elements of site (colorectal), technique (balloon dilation), and guidance (imaging) are all included and no other attributes are introduced. Broader procedures missing imaging, or narrower site-specific variants (colon-only or rectum-only) would not match as precisely. The wording is a safe synonym and remains uniquely codable to the specified concept."
11281000146108,Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation order (record artifact),Do-not-perform CPR order filed,"“Do-not-perform CPR” is a direct synonym for do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and “order filed” clearly situates this as a recorded administrative directive, i.e., a Record artifact. It fits SNOMED CT 11281000146108. Parent or sibling concepts such as general advance directives or DNR status are less suitable since the entry is specifically about the filed order, without additional modifiers."
226413001,Cottage cheese intake (observable entity),Cottage cheese intake in dietary survey,"This entry situates the observable entity within a dietary survey context while focusing specifically on cottage cheese intake. It remains an observable entity with no added attributes such as amount, timing, or frequency, so SCTID 226413001 is appropriate. Parent concepts like general cheese intake are less specific, and siblings referencing other foods do not match. The survey context does not change the core concept; it is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
57295001,"Ricochet missile, device (physical object)",Ricochet missile device,"The main concept expressed is a ricochet missile treated explicitly as a device/physical object. Category: Physical object (device). This wording directly matches SNOMED CT 57295001, which is the specific device concept for a ricochet missile. Broader parents like generic 'missile device' or 'device (physical object)' lack the ricochet qualifier and are therefore less precise. Sibling concepts such as 'bullet device' or causal/event codes would introduce different semantics. No additional attributes (e.g., injury mechanism, timing, severity) are present, making this the most accurate code selection."
846677004,Unable to see retina of right eye (finding),Right eye retinal view absent,"The statement indicates absence of a retinal view in the right eye, denoting inability to see the right retina. It is a Clinical finding and aligns with SNOMED CT 846677004. Unspecified-eye parents, left-eye siblings, or broader fundus visualization concepts are less suitable. “View absent” is clinically equivalent to “unable to visualize” and does not add attributes."
308775002,Entire second aortic arch (body structure),Entirety of the second aortic arch,"The noun 'entirety' signifies the full extent of the second aortic arch. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This aligns with 'Entire second aortic arch' SCTID 308775002 because it denotes the complete anatomical unit. A generic 'second aortic arch' structure could include parts and would be less precise, and any child concept like segmental portions would not match. No added attributes such as disease or developmental stage are introduced."
421016004,Urtica ballotifolia (organism),Botanical identification: Urtica ballotifolia,"The entry indicates a botanical identification with the precise species Urtica ballotifolia, keeping the focus on taxonomy. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This corresponds to SCTID 421016004 and does not add attributes such as disease, exposure, or severity. Using plant or genus-level concepts would be less specific, and no subspecies is implied. The wording is a synonymic paraphrase that preserves the species identity."
473123009,History of bronchiolitis (situation),Clinic follow-up note: history of bronchiolitis,"The clinic note records bronchiolitis as a past condition, with no present illness attributes or etiologies mentioned. The concept is history of bronchiolitis. This is a Situation category in SNOMED CT. 473123009 is the correct, specific code; it avoids mapping to active bronchiolitis or to general respiratory history, aligning with the terminology used."
223636008,Czech republic (geographic location),Country name recorded as: Czech Republic,"This documentation-style entry records the country name value as Czech Republic, which is the national geographic location concept. It maps to SNOMED CT SCTID 223636008. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location, qualifier value). The contextual wording does not introduce attributes that would necessitate a different concept (e.g., event or condition), nor does it point to parent or sibling concepts. The core coded value remains Czech Republic."
407117009,Desirudin (substance),Coding selection: desirudin (substance),"This explicitly frames desirudin as the substance to be coded, aligning perfectly with the SNOMED CT Substance concept Desirudin (substance) 407117009. There are no added attributes like dose or route; therefore, medicinal product concepts or broader anticoagulant class codes would be incorrect."
609357000,Escherichia coli serotype O127:nonmotile (organism),Microbiology: E. coli O127—nonmotile,"This entry names the organism and its serotype O127 and indicates nonmotility, consistent with SNOMED CT 609357000. Category: Organism. The “Microbiology” header is contextual and does not introduce clinical findings beyond the taxonomic identification. It avoids mapping to broader or different organisms by retaining the nonmotile attribute, thereby excluding motile O127 or other serotypes."
102431007,Exposure to polluted bathing water (event),Exposure to tainted bathing water,"This entry communicates exposure to bathing water that is tainted, a clinically equivalent synonym for polluted/contaminated. No timing, severity, or outcome details are given. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 102431007 exactly fits. A generic contaminated water exposure would be less specific, and siblings indicating drinking or other water types would not align. ‘Tainted’ maintains identical semantics to polluted bathing water in this context."
224696002,Lounge-diner room (environment),Combined lounge and dining room,"This explicitly states that the lounge and dining functions are combined within a single room, identifying the environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 224696002 is the best fit because it represents a lounge-diner room. Parent concepts for general rooms are too broad, and sibling concepts of separate lounge or dining rooms are not accurate for a combined space. The paraphrase is a direct synonym of lounge-diner room and does not introduce any new attributes."
258064002,Pneumotachograph (physical object),Pneumotachograph apparatus,"The core concept is a pneumotachograph, described here with the synonym 'apparatus,' which remains a physical object used in respiratory measurement. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the specific code is 258064002. The term 'apparatus' does not add attributes or suggest a broader or different device category, so using a parent (e.g., generic medical device) or sibling (e.g., spirometer) concept would be less precise."
223526006,Republic of Niger (geographic location),Niger (national territory),"This phrasing identifies Niger as a national territory, i.e., a sovereign country, matching SNOMED CT concept 223526006. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The phrase does not introduce clinical attributes; it clarifies the entity as the nation rather than a subregion or physical feature. Parent concepts like 'Geographic location' or 'Country' are too broad, and child regions or sibling countries are not implicated."
396015008,Desloratadine (substance),"Desloratadine, antihistamine",This phrasing identifies desloratadine by name and acknowledges its antihistamine class without introducing product or dosing attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. A class parent like Antihistamine (substance) would be too general; sibling substances and child medicinal products are not correct because the exact molecule is explicitly named and no formulation details are given. The class descriptor does not change code selection from the desloratadine substance concept.
708111001,Untreated water specimen (specimen),Specimen type recorded as untreated water,"This documentation-style entry identifies the specimen type as untreated water, mapping precisely to Untreated water specimen (Specimen; SCTID: 708111001). The SNOMED category is Specimen, and there are no added attributes like source, volume, or testing modality. A parent code like Water specimen is insufficiently specific, and sibling codes indicating treatment or specific water sources would be inappropriate. The wording remains focused on the specimen type and supports the exact concept."
768448009,Product containing chromium radioisotope (product),Manufactured product with chromium radioisotope,"Main concept: a manufactured product that includes a chromium radioisotope component; no specific isotope number, salt, or use is indicated. SNOMED CT category: Product. The best match is SCTID 768448009, which captures a product containing a chromium radioisotope at a general level. Broader parents (e.g., products with any radioisotope) lack chromium specification, and narrower children (e.g., Cr-51 sodium chromate products) add details not present. The term “manufactured” clarifies product status without changing the core concept."
706294009,Basic diagnostic x-ray system (physical object),Installation record: Basic diagnostic X-ray system,"The installation entry identifies a basic diagnostic X-ray system being installed. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 706294009 is the precise mapping because it reflects a basic diagnostic X-ray system; broader parents would lack the basic detail, and alternative device types (portable/mobile, interventional C-arm, fluoroscopy, mammography, dental, digital/CR, or components) are not implied. The installation context does not change the device concept."
223890003,Merseyside (geographic location),Merseyside,"The entry explicitly names the geographic place Merseyside without additional qualifiers. The main concept is a named geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The SCTID 223890003 matches the precise place name 'Merseyside' and is the most specific concept for this location. Parent concepts like 'England' or 'United Kingdom' are broader and less precise, while child or sibling concepts (e.g., Liverpool, Wirral) would narrow the location incorrectly. No added attributes are present; this is the exact label of the geographic entity."
248355007,Percentage underweight (observable entity),Underweight percentage result = 7%,"Presenting a result value for underweight percentage clearly identifies the observable entity. The most precise SNOMED CT code is Percentage underweight [248355007]. This does not represent percent weight loss or BMI metrics, which are different siblings, nor does it state a diagnosis of underweight, avoiding a parent/child mismatch."
297249002,Family history of procedure (situation),Family history positive for procedure,"This is standard clinical notation indicating presence of a procedure in the family history. It does not specify the procedure, timing, or relation, only the positive status. The concept belongs to SNOMED CT Situation with explicit context and best maps to Family history of procedure (SCTID: 297249002). A parent concept such as generic family history would be too broad, while child or sibling concepts (e.g., family history of surgery or personal history of procedure) add specificity or change the context not present in the entry."
441620008,Oral fluid specimen (specimen),Specimen description: oral fluid,"The specimen description stating ‘oral fluid’ denotes exactly the material collected, aligning with Oral fluid specimen (specimen), SCTID 441620008, under the Specimen category. No other attributes are added, and saliva or other specific oral fluids are not implied, ensuring this code is the most precise match versus parent/sibling concepts."
224876007,Social education center (environment),Setting: social education center,"The term 'Setting' clarifies this is a location/context descriptor, consistent with Environment concepts in SNOMED CT. The specific setting 'social education center' pins it to SCTID 224876007. No added attributes such as timing or severity are present. Broader parents (e.g., 'Education center') would lose specificity, while siblings like 'School' or 'Adult education center' change the type of setting, hence the given concept remains the most appropriate."
250000008,Step length (observable entity),Step length,"The entry explicitly names the gait parameter 'step length,' which is the spatial distance covered with each step between successive contacts of opposite feet. This is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT. The most precise match is Step length (SCTID: 250000008) because the wording denotes the property being observed or measured without any qualifiers, values, laterality, or interpretation. Broader parent concepts like generic gait observables are less specific, and sibling concepts such as stride length, step time, or cadence describe different gait parameters, so they do not fit this wording."
79895001,Genus Candoia (organism),Organism: Candoia,"This entry is a structured organism field specifying the genus name Candoia, with no added clinical qualifiers. It fits the Organism hierarchy and maps to SNOMED CT 79895001 Genus Candoia. Parents like family-level categories are less precise; child species are not mentioned; sibling genera are not suggested. The colon format simply indicates the field label and does not alter the concept."
223973008,Mid Glamorgan (geographic location),Imaging location: Mid Glamorgan,The entry frames an imaging context but identifies Mid Glamorgan as the sole geographic concept. Category: Geographic location (Location). Code 223973008 matches exactly to Mid Glamorgan. It avoids broader mapping (Wales) and narrower mapping (specific towns or districts). The imaging context is metadata and does not alter the target location.
225759009,After menstrual period (qualifier value),Patient-reported timing: after menstrual period,"This presents the temporal qualifier from a patient-reported perspective while still expressing only the ‘after menstruation’ timing. No symptoms or other details are introduced. Category: Qualifier value. The correct mapping is 225759009 ‘After menstrual period (qualifier value)’. It avoids specifying ‘last’ menstrual period or cycle phases, and does not shift to other qualifiers such as ‘before’ or ‘during’."
103589008,Citrus limon (organism),Citrus limon plant,"The term 'Citrus limon plant' clearly denotes the organism species in plant form. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It avoids reference to fruit products or plant parts and does not broaden or narrow to other taxa or cultivars. Thus, the species-level concept Citrus limon (organism) is the most precise match."
63215004,Structure of anterior basal segment of left lower lobe of lung (body structure),"Segment: anterior basal, left lower lobe (lung)","The wording identifies the segment and its location: anterior basal within the left lower lung lobe, i.e., a Body structure. This maps to SCTID 63215004. It excludes broader parent concepts and avoids sibling segments (posterior or lateral basal). The structured phrasing is a semantically equivalent reference to the preferred term without adding attributes or altering specificity."
223724006,Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (geographic location),Country name: República Bolivariana de Venezuela,"This entry uses the official Spanish country name, indicating the sovereign state and mapping directly to SNOMED CT 223724006. The main concept is a country-level geographic location; the field label does not add extra attributes. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). It excludes parent generalities (e.g., the class of countries) and does not point to any child locations within Venezuela. The synonymous official name is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and supports the same code."
1345158009,Aspiration of food into trachea (event),Aspiration of food into trachea,"The entry explicitly states the event of aspiration with the substance (food) and the anatomical site (trachea). The main concept is an aspiration event involving food entering the trachea, with no added severity, timing, or associated conditions. This fits the SNOMED CT category Event. The SCTID 1345158009 is the most precise match because it specifically codes an aspiration of food into the trachea, rather than the broader parent such as aspiration into the respiratory tract or siblings like foreign body in trachea (disorder). No attributes beyond food and trachea are introduced, so this wording cleanly selects the exact event concept."
122551003,Peripheral blood specimen (specimen),Peripheral blood collected (specimen),"The entry indicates that a specimen of peripheral blood was collected, without specifying venous versus capillary, tube type, or processing. Within SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Specimen category and maps to Peripheral blood specimen (SCTID 122551003). A parent code such as Blood specimen would drop the explicit peripheral qualifier. A more specific child (e.g., peripheral venous blood specimen) or sibling (capillary/arterial blood) would introduce attributes not present. The phrase includes ""specimen"" to clarify intent and remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
737437006,Hyperglycemia self management plan (record artifact),Care coordination note: hyperglycemia self-management plan,"Stating that a care coordination note contains the hyperglycemia self-management plan does not change the artifact’s nature; it remains a patient self-management plan specific to hyperglycemia. SNOMED CT concept 737437006 (Record artifact) fits best. This does not drift into general care planning or other conditions, avoiding parent/sibling mismatches and adding no attributes."
701820004,Infant umbilical hernia plaster (physical object),Catalog entry: infant umbilical hernia plaster,"Presented as a catalog listing, the entry denotes the physical object: an infant umbilical hernia plaster. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and SCTID 701820004 is the most precise code due to the device type and age-specific designation. The wording does not imply a procedure, condition, or device presence, preventing misclassification. Parent concepts lacking infant specificity and sibling devices like binders/trusses are not appropriate matches. Catalog context is neutral and does not introduce attributes beyond product identification."
63581000119104,History of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (situation),Clinical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"This clearly communicates that the patient’s clinical history includes CLL, framing it as a historical context. The SNOMED category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 63581000119104 maps directly to history of CLL. Selecting the disorder code for CLL would misrepresent the current status, and choosing a parent concept like history of leukemia would be too broad. No additional attributes beyond the history context are present."
411619009,Alpha-lactalbumin diagnostic allergen extract (product),α-lactalbumin diagnostic allergen extract,"This entry uses the Greek letter “α” for alpha, a standard synonym in clinical labeling, while preserving the exact concept of a diagnostic allergen extract containing alpha-lactalbumin. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 411619009 is precise because it specifies alpha-lactalbumin and diagnostic extract form. Parent concepts (e.g., generic allergen extracts) are too broad, while sibling concepts refer to different allergens. The orthographic variant does not introduce new attributes and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
224861004,Montessori school (environment),School environment: Montessori school,"This places the Montessori school squarely in the school environment category. Main concept: Montessori school environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 224861004 is exact; parent “School (environment)” is too general, and sibling subtypes (e.g., “Secondary school,” “Kindergarten”) do not match the Montessori specification. The phrase is a direct synonymic representation of the environment concept."
446907008,Urine specimen obtained from kidney (specimen),Source: kidney; Specimen: urine,"This form lists the specimen as urine and its source as the kidney, which precisely matches the SNOMED CT Specimen concept for urine obtained from kidney origin. No technique, laterality, or test intent is included. A generic urine specimen parent would miss the source detail, and alternative site sources (bladder, ureter) are not suggested. The label-style phrasing is equivalent and supports coding to 'Urine specimen obtained from kidney.'"
414953007,Oral vitamin K prophylaxis given by community midwife (situation),Record shows oral vitamin K prophylaxis given by community midwife,"This documentation-oriented entry still asserts that oral vitamin K prophylaxis was given by a community midwife, conforming to SNOMED CT situation 414953007. General vitamin K administration concepts or those without performer or route detail are too broad, and concepts indicating IM route or other providers would be incorrect. The documentation context does not add new clinical attributes and is semantically equivalent."
114047008,Halomonas aquamarina (organism),Bacterium identified: Halomonas aquamarina,"The phrase indicates that the bacterium identified is the species Halomonas aquamarina, stating only the organism’s name without adding clinical context, site, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the correct code is Halomonas aquamarina (organism), SCTID 114047008. Choosing a parent genus concept would be less precise. No strain or subspecies detail is present, ruling out children, and no sibling species are mentioned. The term 'bacterium' is a clinically equivalent synonym describing the organism type and does not change code selection."
216320006,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, private driveway (environment)",Clinician documentation: environment—private driveway.,"This clinician note explicitly labels the environment as a private driveway, stating only the place-of-occurrence attribute. It belongs to the Environment category in SNOMED CT and maps specifically to 'Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, private driveway' (SCTID: 216320006). Choosing a parent would omit the private driveway specificity, and sibling concepts like street/highway or public driveway would be inaccurate. The language contains no additional attributes."
69741000119103,History of panretinal photocoagulation (situation),Panretinal photocoagulation on record (history),"“On record (history)” indicates a documented prior occurrence of panretinal photocoagulation, without adding any other attributes. SNOMED CT category: Situation. The precise concept is history of PRP, aligning with SCTID 69741000119103; broader history concepts or the procedural PRP code would not reflect the specific historical status captured here."
39176004,Airplane-based care (environment),Nursing documentation: care rendered on a plane,"From nursing notes, the entry indicates care rendered on a plane, centering on the environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It aligns with SCTID 39176004 as airplane-based care. Broader parent categories would be less precise, and siblings such as ship-based or helicopter-based environments would be incorrect. 'Plane' is synonymous with 'airplane' and maintains the same coding intent."
48469005,Cytologic material (specimen),Chart problem list item: cytology specimen,"Even in a problem list style, ‘cytology specimen’ denotes a specimen intended for cytologic evaluation without attributing site, collection technique, or preparation. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 48469005 maps precisely because it represents cytologic material (specimen) in a general, unqualified manner. The parent Specimen would be insufficiently specific, and children/siblings like Pap smear specimen or cytology smear specimen would add details not included. The phrase is a safe synonym and retains the same concept."
446364005,Specimen from donor corneal storage medium (specimen),Corneal donor storage medium sample submitted,"The entry indicates a sample from the storage medium for a corneal donor, framing it as a specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to SCTID 446364005 because it specifies donor corneal storage medium as the source. The submission context does not alter the specimen type, and the phrasing does not imply tissue or broader ocular media. Thus, parent concepts are less precise and tissue-based siblings are incorrect. The wording remains equivalent to the preferred term."
123840003,Specimen contaminated (finding),Specimen contaminated,"The entry states that the specimen is contaminated, which cleanly expresses the concept of contamination of a clinical specimen without introducing any additional attributes such as specimen type, cause, timing, or severity. This aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 123840003, Specimen contaminated (finding), which is a Clinical finding indicating contamination. Broader parent concepts like general specimen quality issues are less precise, and child or sibling concepts that specify a particular specimen type (e.g., urine, blood) or different problems (e.g., mislabeled, insufficient) are not warranted here because no such details are present."
411234008,Textile colors and finishes patch test product (product),Textile colors/finishes patch test product,"The slash construction still conveys a single product covering textile colors and finishes without adding extraneous details. The main concept is a patch test product; category is Product. The best match is SCTID 411234008. It does not introduce result, site, or brand attributes. A general patch test product parent would be too broad, and concepts for different allergen classes are not applicable."
1184594008,Runaway risk document section (record artifact),Runaway risk documentation section,"This wording explicitly denotes a documentation section labeled for runaway risk, highlighting the structural record artifact rather than a clinical evaluation. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The best match is 1184594008 Runaway risk document section (record artifact). A parent Document section would be overly broad; a sibling such as a risk finding or procedure would be inappropriate. The synonym “documentation section” is equivalent to “document section” in clinical informatics and does not change the code."
245994002,Entire rectus capitis posterior major (body structure),Complete rectus capitis posterior major,"“Complete” is a clinically safe synonym for “entire,” indicating the full muscle. The entry refers to the rectus capitis posterior major only, with no added elements such as laterality or disease. SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This best fits SCTID 245994002 rather than a parent concept (e.g., general structure of the muscle) or a child concept involving parts, attachments, or segments. Sibling structures (like rectus capitis posterior minor) are not implicated."
224925005,Countryside (environment),Countryside locality,"The entry labels the locality as 'countryside,' identifying an environmental type without added attributes. It maps to the Environment or geographical location category, with the most precise code being Countryside (environment), SCTID 224925005. 'Locality' is a neutral term for place/environment and does not shift the concept toward residence or exposure. Sibling concepts like Rural area, Farm, or Urban area are distinct and not indicated."
710069003,Tick specimen (specimen),Laboratory: tick specimen,"The entry indicates, within a laboratory context, that the specimen is a tick. Contextual wording ('Laboratory') does not alter the core concept or add attributes beyond the specimen identity. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and Tick specimen (specimen) is the exact representation. It is not a test, procedure, or broader specimen type, and it does not specify species or other child-level details."
1288041004,History of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of thymus (situation),Past medical history: well-differentiated thymic neuroendocrine tumor,"This phrasing documents the condition as part of the patient's past medical history, indicating a historical context rather than active disease. It names a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor and specifies the thymus as the site, which aligns with the Situation with explicit context category. SCTID 1288041004 is the most accurate code because it encodes both the historical status and the exact tumor type/site. More general parent concepts (e.g., history of thymic neoplasm) omit the well-differentiated neuroendocrine detail, and sibling concepts (e.g., history of neuroendocrine carcinoma of thymus) would reflect a different differentiation. The synonym “thymic neuroendocrine tumor” remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term when qualified as well-differentiated."
228906003,Megajoule/day (qualifier value),Result unit: MJ/day,"This entry indicates MJ/day as the unit of a result, which is still the same qualifier value of megajoule/day without any amount or other attributes. It belongs to the Qualifier value hierarchy and maps to SNOMED CT 228906003. Parent concepts (generic result units) are overly broad, and sibling options (MJ/hour, kJ/day) represent different units. The phrase preserves the unit identity exactly."
284349006,Location within home premises (environment),Incident place categorized as within home premises,"The phrase conveys only the place category—'within home premises'—without describing the incident itself, maintaining a pure environmental classification. It maps to the Environment hierarchy and matches SCTID 284349006, which defines a location within home premises for place-of-occurrence contexts. More general concepts like 'Home' do not capture this specific categorization, while any sibling such as 'outside home premises' would be contradictory. The term 'incident place' is a common documentation context and does not change the semantic target of the code."
226705003,Pinni (substance),Pinni sweetmeat,"This phrasing uses 'sweetmeat' as a cultural synonym for confectionery, while preserving the specific named item Pinni. No actions, timing, or severity are implied. The category is Substance, and the most precise match is Pinni (substance), SCTID 226705003. Parent concepts (e.g., generic sweetmeat substances) are too broad, and other named sweets as siblings are not referenced, making this entry uniquely codable to Pinni."
19440001,Explosion (physical force),Explosion event,"This entry identifies an event characterized solely by explosive physical force. The category is Physical force. It does not introduce injuries, exposure, location, severity, or timing, so it fits exactly with Explosion (physical force) SCTID 19440001. Broader parent concepts lack specificity, and sibling concepts like blast injury or exposure to explosion would add clinical circumstances not present in the text."
365400002,Finding of puberty stage (finding),Diagnostic report lists pubertal stage as a finding,"This entry frames the pubertal stage as a reported finding within a diagnostic report. It indicates a Clinical finding and aligns with SNOMED CT 365400002. No specific stage number or scale is mentioned, preventing over-specific mapping to child concepts. It also avoids any abnormal qualifiers that would indicate disorders. The terminology does not invoke sexual maturity rating or Tanner scales, keeping sibling concepts aside. Therefore, 365400002 is the most precise mapping."
846608008,Chiropractic clinic (environment),Location of care: chiropractic clinic,"The phrase specifies the location of care as a chiropractic clinic, clearly communicating the environment. Main concept: location/venue environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The contextual label does not introduce timing or other attributes. A non-specific clinic code would be too broad; other clinical settings would be wrong. SCTID 846608008 precisely matches the stated environment."
1366409002,Entire sternocostal region (body structure),Localization: entire sternocostal region,"Presented as a localization tag, the content is the anatomical Body structure of the full sternocostal region. It maps to SNOMED CT SCTID 1366409002. The descriptor does not include findings, laterality, or extent beyond 'entire.' Concepts for joints, sternum alone, or ribs alone would be too narrow, and chest wall parents too broad; therefore, the 'entire sternocostal region' is the most accurate code selection."
735325009,Unplanned inpatient care plan (record artifact),Plan of care: unplanned inpatient admission,"This entry denotes a documented plan of care specifically for an unplanned inpatient admission, and it introduces no further attributes. Category: Record artifact. The wording aligns with SCTID 735325009, with “plan of care” equivalent to care plan and the unplanned inpatient context explicit. Parent/sibling concepts either omit the unplanned detail (inpatient care plan) or change the planning status or setting (planned inpatient, outpatient), so they are less appropriate. No additional qualifiers are present."
781211000,Structure of tendon within left upper arm (body structure),Left upper arm tendinous anatomy,"The entry indicates tendon-related anatomy within the left upper arm, with explicit laterality and region, and no additional clinical attributes. It is an anatomical Body structure and corresponds to SCTID 781211000. Parent concepts that omit laterality or broaden the region, and child concepts naming particular tendons, do not match the generic anatomical phrasing used here. “Tendinous anatomy” is a safe synonym expressing tendon structure without changing the concept."
773452005,Psychology care plan (record artifact),Imaging report addendum: psychology care plan,"Even in an imaging report addendum, this entry references the psychology care plan as the artifact; the content itself is the psychology care plan without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and SCTID 773452005 is the most precise mapping. A parent care plan code lacks the specified discipline, and siblings such as Psychiatry care plan or Mental health care plan are not supported by the wording. The context does not alter the artifact concept being coded."
1187456001,"Virgin Islands, British (geographic location)",Virgin Islands—British,"The em dash construction is a stylistic variant that still denotes the British Virgin Islands. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. It precisely matches SCTID 1187456001 and does not collapse into the generic Virgin Islands (parent-like) or shift to the U.S. Virgin Islands (sibling). No sublocation is specified, so child concepts are excluded. The phrasing contains no clinical attributes like travel or residence, so it remains strictly a location."
109241000119103,Family history of eruptive xanthoma (situation),Positive family history for eruptive xanthoma.,"The phrase “positive family history” indicates the presence of eruptive xanthoma in relatives, not the patient. This is a Situation context and corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 109241000119103. It is more specific than broader family history of xanthoma and does not drift into sibling concepts like personal history or the Disorder concept of eruptive xanthoma in the patient. No extra qualifiers (e.g., severity, degree of relation) are added."
85684007,"Engraving press, device (physical object)",Engraving press machinery,"Main concept: engraving press framed as machinery. No additional attributes are stated. SNOMED CT category: Physical object – Device. ‘Machinery’ here is equivalent to equipment/device in common technical documentation and still refers specifically to the engraving press, keeping SCTID 85684007 appropriate. A broader machinery category would be imprecise, and siblings (e.g., hydraulic press not meant for engraving) do not match the wording."
466524001,"Wheelchair, attendant-driven, collapsible (physical object)",PT eval: uses a foldable attendant-pushed wheelchair,"In therapy evaluation context, the device is a foldable (collapsible) wheelchair that is attendant-pushed. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The description directly aligns with SCTID 466524001. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts for self-propelled or powered wheelchairs do not match the specified attendant propulsion."
250905001,Optokinetic response (observable entity),Optokinetic response variable,"Describing the optokinetic response as a variable conveys that it is the measurable entity in question, which is an Observable entity. SCTID 250905001 is the most precise match since it codes the specific parameter rather than any clinical finding or the act of testing. Parent or sibling concepts related to reflexes or nystagmus introduce different semantic types and are not supported by the entry’s wording."
306149001,Referral to medical microbiology service (procedure),Referral made to medical microbiology service,"A completed referral to the medical microbiology service corresponds directly to the procedure concept 306149001. Category: Procedure. The entry lacks any additional attributes (e.g., urgency, timing detail, indication). It does not imply lab tests or a consultation outcome, avoiding misclassification into sibling or child concepts. Thus, it is the most precise match to the named service referral."
257301003,K-wire (physical object),K-wire (Kirschner wire),"This entry presents the abbreviation with its full term, confirming the synonymous identity of the object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). It precisely matches K-wire (physical object) SCTID 257301003 because both labels refer to the same device. Broader parents (wire, orthopedic device) are not as specific, and siblings (other pins/wires) differ in type. The notation adds no clinical attributes."
248132003,Craving for food or drink (finding),Behavioral health: endorses food/drink craving,"In a behavioral health context, the patient endorses a craving for food or drink, which remains a clinical finding. This matches SNOMED CT 248132003 because it describes craving for either food or beverages broadly. It does not introduce compulsivity, severity, or timing that would alter coding, and it avoids hunger/thirst or specific-item cravings."
54020003,Rasahus (organism),Rasahus (genus) documented,"The phrase documents the genus Rasahus as the organism, explicitly indicating the taxonomic rank. The best SNOMED CT match is the Organism concept Rasahus, code 54020003. No species-level detail is included, and no higher-level taxa are referenced, so parent, child, or sibling concepts would be inaccurate. This synonym keeps the scope at the genus and preserves code selection."
310101009,Speech and language therapy service (qualifier value),Speech-language pathology—service,"The term specifies the speech-language pathology service rather than a procedure or department, and no attributes like timing or conditions are included. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, with SCTID 310101009 as the exact match. Parent services are less specific, and sibling procedure/referral concepts are inappropriate given the wording. The 'pathology' discipline is the accepted synonym for speech and language therapy in many locales."
412134004,Taraxacum officinale extract (substance),Supplement component: Taraxacum officinale extract,"The entry identifies the substance Taraxacum officinale extract as a component, with 'supplement' providing contextual placement but not altering the substance identity. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Since no formulation, dosage, or plant part is specified, it should not be coded as a medicinal product or administration situation. The species-level extract matches SCTID 412134004 best over parent or child alternatives."
53771000087107,History of closure of patent foramen ovale (situation),Echo indication: patient with history of PFO closure,"In the context of test indications, this specifies that the patient has a historical PFO closure. It represents a Situation with history and maps to 'History of closure of patent foramen ovale (situation).' The entry does not describe current performance of the closure, nor does it add technique or device attributes, avoiding misclassification to procedural codes. The phrase is a clinically equivalent expression of the same history concept."
261161001,Posterior chamber lens (physical object),Posterior chamber eye lens implant,"This phrase indicates an eye lens implant located in the posterior chamber, which in clinical usage denotes a posterior chamber intraocular lens. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It best matches Posterior chamber lens (261161001) and avoids specifying material, optical features, laterality, or procedural status. It is more specific than the parent intraocular lens and does not narrow to child variants."
416636000,Product containing glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (product),Inventory item: product with GLP-1 receptor agonist,"The entry describes a stock inventory item that is a product containing a GLP-1 receptor agonist; it adds no brand, dose, route, indication, or combination details. It should be coded to the SNOMED CT Pharmaceutical/biologic product category, SCTID 416636000. The inventory context is merely documentation and does not transform the concept into a substance or a procedure. Specific-ingredient child concepts are not appropriate because the entry does not name any particular GLP-1 agonist."
217766005,Accidental drowning or immersion during marine salvage (event),EMS narrative: accidental drowning or immersion took place during marine salvage,"The content expresses an accidental drowning/immersion tied to marine salvage, with no added attributes like fatality or intent. Category: Event. It fits SCTID 217766005, as it contains the accidental exposure and the salvage context. Using a general reporting phrase (“EMS narrative”) does not alter the concept. Broader parent codes omit the salvage qualifier; siblings like near-drowning or water exposure during different maritime activities would misrepresent the context. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent."
31089006,Rear-fanged snake (organism),Rear-fanged snake,"The main concept expressed is a snake characterized by rear-positioned fangs, matching the organism concept of rear-fanged snake. No attributes such as species, location, venom status, or clinical events are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this resides in the Organism hierarchy, and 31089006 Rear-fanged snake (organism) is the most precise code. A parent like Snake (organism) is too general, while any specific species (child concepts) or sibling groupings such as front-fanged or non-fanged snakes would be less appropriate. The wording uses the preferred term directly, ensuring exact equivalence."
1157335009,Numeric grade on a scale of 1 to 5 (qualifier value),Five-point numeric grading (1 to 5),"This phrase states a five-point numeric grading system with the exact range 1 to 5, aligning with SNOMED CT 1157335009 as a qualifier value. It conveys only the existence of the grading scale and no additional attributes. The category is Qualifier value. A parent concept without the specified limits would be less specific, while child concepts denoting an individual grade or sibling concepts for different point counts (e.g., four-point scale) would not fit. 'Five-point numeric grading' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase to 'numeric grade on a scale of 1 to 5.'"
46715004,Pharyngeal mucous membrane structure (body structure),Patient education topic: pharyngeal mucosa,"Even in an education context, the term denotes the same anatomical entity: the pharyngeal mucosa, mapping to 46715004. Category: Body structure. The wording introduces no pathology or subsite restriction, confirming it should not be coded to broader pharyngeal structures or to regional mucosa subsets. It is a true synonym of the preferred concept."
433403009,Product containing elastase inhibitor (product),Elastase inhibitor medication (product),"The entry refers to a medication product defined by the presence of an elastase inhibitor, with no details on dose, route, brand, or indication. It belongs to the Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product) category. SCTID 433403009 is the precise code, covering products that contain elastase inhibitor. Parent concepts for medications or protease-inhibitor products are too broad, and a child concept for a specific elastase inhibitor ingredient would be too narrow. The synonym does not introduce any additional attributes."
285718009,Structure of middle hemorrhoidal vein (body structure),Vena haemorrhoidalis media,"The Latin term ""Vena haemorrhoidalis media"" is clinically equivalent to middle hemorrhoidal (rectal) vein, referencing the same specific venous structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to concept 285718009 as the precise middle hemorrhoidal vein structure. Parent concepts for hemorrhoidal or rectal veins would be too general, and siblings (superior or inferior) would not match. The synonym is appropriate and does not introduce any additional attributes."
223637004,Germany (geographic location),Referral from Germany,"Despite the procedural phrasing, the only geographic entity named is Germany, which is the target concept to code. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location), and 223637004 Germany (geographic location) is the precise match. No broader or narrower geographic entity is indicated, and no sibling country is referenced, so Germany is the correct code."
399127009,Teufel projection (qualifier value),Teufel projection specified,"This entry indicates that the named projection ""Teufel"" is specified, without adding attributes such as anatomical site, laterality, or timing. The core concept remains the Teufel projection qualifier. In SNOMED CT, the exact match is Teufel projection (qualifier value), SCTID 399127009. A general projection parent would be overly broad, and different named projections are siblings. The phrasing does not alter the concept into a procedure or position; it remains a qualifier value."
82313006,Suicide attempt (event),Tried to take own life,"This entry conveys an attempted act to end one’s own life, aligning with the concept of a suicide attempt. It introduces no method, timing, severity, or certainty modifiers. In SNOMED CT, the category is Event, and 82313006 Suicide attempt (event) is the most specific code. Broader concepts like intentional self-harm or suicidal behavior would be less precise because they do not guarantee suicidal intent, and ideation or completed suicide would misrepresent the event."
763249000,Mental health care program approach contingency plan (record artifact),Release packet: mental health care program approach contingency plan,This describes inclusion of the document within a release packet but preserves the underlying artifact: a contingency plan related to the mental health care program approach. It remains a Record artifact and is best coded to SCTID 763249000. A generic release document or other plan types would be less specific. The context of a packet does not change the semantic identity of the artifact or introduce new clinical attributes.
444966004,Born before arrival of midwife (situation),Born prior to the midwife’s arrival at the scene,"The entry conveys that the baby was born before the midwife’s arrival on scene, indicating birth before attendance/presence. The concept is limited to the temporal relationship, without specifying location or cause. Category: Situation with explicit context. It aligns with SCTID 444966004 because it identifies the midwife as the attendant and arrival post-birth. Concepts focused on hospital arrival or unattended delivery do not reflect this specific midwife context. “Arrival at the scene” is a clinically standard expression equivalent to attendance/presence."
279046003,Pressure - physical agent (physical force),Physical force: pressure,"Stating 'pressure' as a physical force identifies the same concept as Pressure - physical agent (physical force), SCTID 279046003. There are no added attributes (e.g., medium, severity, timing, or body site) that would shift coding. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. Broader or sibling concepts (Compression, Gravity, Vibration) are not indicated; nor is this an observable measurement. Therefore, this is the precise match for the agent level of pressure."
258582006,Blood clot specimen (specimen),Blood clot sent as the specimen,"This entry indicates the specimen being sent is a blood clot, mapping precisely to Blood clot specimen (specimen), SCTID 258582006. The central concept is a specimen consisting of coagulated blood, with no additional attributes included. SNOMED category: Specimen. More general or alternative blood specimen types (whole blood, serum, plasma) do not fit because a clot is specified. The phrasing introduces only logistical context and does not alter the specimen identity."
113172002,Free-standing oncology clinic (environment),Standalone oncology clinic,"The wording describes the place of care: an oncology clinic that is standalone. The main concept is an environmental setting; attributes are oncology specialty and standalone/freestanding configuration. This is an Environment or geographical location in SNOMED CT. The exact code is 113172002, Free-standing oncology clinic (environment), as 'standalone' is a common synonym for free-standing. Parent concepts are too broad without the freestanding characteristic, and sibling concepts that indicate hospital-based clinics or specific oncology subspecialties are inappropriate given the general oncology clinic context."
278956005,Structure of right ventricular interleaflet triangle (body structure),Examined structure: right ventricular interleaflet triangle,"The wording acknowledges examination, but the main concept remains the anatomical structure of the right ventricular interleaflet triangle. It maps most precisely to the SNOMED CT Body structure 'Structure of right ventricular interleaflet triangle' (278956005). Parents such as 'right ventricle' or 'cardiac structure' would lack specificity, and siblings in other cardiac locations would not match. The examination context does not introduce findings or modifiers that would change coding."
411699005,Hippoglossus hippoglossus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergist note: utilized Atlantic halibut diagnostic allergen extract,"This documentation notes use of the diagnostic allergen extract for Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus). That is the SNOMED 411699005 product concept. The statement avoids treatment, route, dose, or results. Parent fish-allergen products are too general, and sibling species would misrepresent the organism."
898201001,Specimen from device (specimen),Laboratory specimen with source documented as device,"This lab-context entry identifies the specimen and explicitly documents its source as a device. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the precise concept is “Specimen from device (specimen)” 898201001. A generic specimen parent would fail to capture the source, and specifying any device subtype would be too narrow. The term “laboratory specimen” is contextual and does not introduce a different specimen type or testing attribute, keeping the mapping appropriate."
440468004,Tampon submitted as specimen (specimen),Tampon used as specimen.,"The phrase indicates the tampon’s role as the specimen, aligning with Tampon submitted as specimen (SCTID 440468004), a Specimen concept. 'Used as' here is equivalent to 'designated/submitted as' in specimen context and does not introduce site, timing, or method attributes. It is more specific than the parent 'Specimen' and distinct from other specimen types."
411148002,Acrylate and methacrylate patch test series - artificial nail (product),Allergen series — artificial nail acrylate/methacrylate (patch test),"The entry names an allergen series for patch testing that is explicitly about artificial nail acrylate/methacrylate exposures. This is a Product and corresponds to SCTID 411148002. Parent or sibling concepts would be broader (e.g., general acrylate series) or differently scoped (e.g., dental materials), making them less suitable. It does not introduce any procedural steps, results, or specific compounds, thereby avoiding mapping to procedure or substance-level concepts. The parenthetical “patch test” clarifies intended use without changing the code."
289332002,Umbilical cord stump base inflamed (finding),Triage: inflamed base of umbilical cord stump.,"This triage documentation identifies inflammation at the base of the umbilical cord stump, specifying both the finding and location. Clinical finding category. SNOMED CT 289332002 is the precise representation of stump base inflammation. Parent concepts lacking the base detail and sibling concepts with different sites or causation are less accurate. The triage context does not alter the medical attributes of the finding."
846609000,Community pharmacy (environment),Clinical setting: community pharmacy,"This entry specifies the clinical setting as a community pharmacy, which is an environment context and maps precisely to SNOMED CT 846609000, category Environment. It does not introduce care details, timing, or other attributes—only the type of setting. The wording excludes hospital pharmacy settings and is more specific than a generic 'pharmacy' environment parent, making the community pharmacy concept the best fit."
413193001,"Non-guide bougie, device (physical object)",Non-guide bougie utilized intraoperatively,"Operative context is provided, but the key concept is the device subtype: non-guide bougie. No anatomy or specific procedure characteristics are added. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). This maps to 413193001 Non-guide bougie, device, with 'non-guide' clearly restricting the subtype. Parent 'Bougie, device' would be too general, and 'Guide bougie, device' is incompatible."
309792003,Via inferior meatus (qualifier value),Through inferior meatus,"“Through inferior meatus” conveys the same route/approach as the preferred term, using the synonym “through.” The main concept is a procedural access path via the inferior nasal meatus, which matches the Qualifier value category. There are no added attributes beyond the route. Parent concepts like generic nasal approaches are too broad, and siblings referring to other meatus levels would be incorrect. This does not denote the anatomical structure itself, only the route via it, so SNOMED CT 309792003 is the most precise fit."
1356760003,Union for International Cancer Control cNX(sn) (qualifier value),Registry entry: Union for International Cancer Control cNX(sn),"The registry entry uses the full name of UICC and the cNX(sn) notation, which indicates clinical NX with sentinel node designation. The concept is a qualifier value defining the clinical nodal status as not assessable in sentinel node context. This directly corresponds to SCTID 1356760003. Removing the sn notation or switching to pathologic nodal categories would not match the entry’s specificity."
255569004,Suprasternal (qualifier value),Access site qualifier: suprasternal,"The entry labels the access site using the suprasternal qualifier without adding procedural details. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This aligns with Suprasternal (255569004), maintaining a location qualifier rather than a distinct procedure or anatomical structure concept, so parent or sibling terms would be less precise."
1373834000,Ahmed ClearPath 250 valveless drainage device (physical object),Catalog entry: Ahmed ClearPath 250 valveless drainage device,"Catalog context references the item as a physical device, not a procedure or finding. The brand/model and valveless characteristic point to Ahmed ClearPath 250 valveless drainage device (SCTID 1373834000). Generic parent categories or sibling models (ClearPath 350, valved Ahmed devices) would be less appropriate. No new attributes like timing or anatomical site are introduced."
434704005,Crenothrix polyspora (organism),Crenothrix polyspora,"The entry states the exact scientific species name, Crenothrix polyspora, without any clinical assertions or additional attributes. The main concept is the organism itself, and no timing, severity, location, or presence in a sample is implied. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the most precise match is the species-level concept Crenothrix polyspora (organism), SCTID 434704005. Broader parents like genus-level Crenothrix or higher bacterial categories would be less specific, and child concepts such as strain-level designations would add granularity not present here. No sibling species are referenced, ensuring this entry maps uniquely to the specified organism concept."
438115002,Streptomyces carpaticus (organism),Taxonomic entry: Streptomyces carpaticus,"The phrase indicates a taxonomic entry and specifies Streptomyces carpaticus, without additional attributes such as site or role. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The species-level designation corresponds to SCTID 438115002. Parent genus-level concepts or broader taxa would be insufficiently specific, and sibling species would not match the stated name. The taxonomic context is descriptive and does not change coding to anything other than the organism."
328699000,Gluten-free and low protein cookies (product),Diet includes gluten-free low-protein cookies,"This documentation states that the diet includes a specific product: cookies that are gluten-free and low-protein, with no extra qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Product; the product referred to is SCTID 328699000. Switching to a broader parent such as ‘gluten-free foods’ or ‘cookies’ would lose specificity, and selecting siblings like ‘gluten-free cookies’ or ‘low-protein cookies’ would omit one attribute. The phrase is a direct synonymic description of the concept, maintaining precise alignment with the code."
119243000,Supratentorial brain part (body structure),Supratentorial part of brain,"This phrase is a direct synonym of the preferred term, describing the part of the brain located above the tentorium cerebelli without adding laterality or condition attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The concept aligns with Supratentorial brain part (119243000), and is more precise than the generic parent 'brain structure' because it specifies supratentorial location. It does not introduce specific subregions such as frontal or parietal lobes, thus avoiding child concepts, and it clearly excludes the infratentorial sibling concept."
702858002,Fracture clinic (environment),Setting: Fracture clinic,"The phrase denotes the care setting as the fracture clinic, emphasizing the environment rather than services or encounters. No extra attributes such as timing or severity are included. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Environment or geographical location hierarchy, with Fracture clinic (environment) [702858002] as the precise concept. A parent like Clinic (environment) would be too general, and siblings (e.g., Trauma clinic) would misrepresent the specialty. 'Setting' is a synonym for environment and does not alter code selection."
263874004,Snow (substance),Environmental substance recorded: snow,"This documentation-style entry labels snow as an environmental substance, which remains a semantic equivalent to the material snow. No additional attributes such as exposure or effects are stated. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The most precise match is Snow (substance) SCTID 263874004; parent classes (generic substances) are too broad, and sibling concepts like environmental events (e.g., snowstorm) would be incorrect because the focus is the substance, not a weather occurrence."
247958000,"Blank, staring face while sleep walking (finding)","Blank, staring face during sleepwalking","The main concept explicitly combines a blank, staring facial expression with the context of sleepwalking. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT and matches the specific concept for blank, staring face while sleep walking. Using this phrasing avoids mapping to broader parent concepts like sleepwalking alone or blank stare alone, and does not introduce extra attributes such as severity or cause. The term is directly equivalent to the stated finding and thus is the most precise match."
309502007,Fetus specimen (specimen),"Follow-up note: ""Reviewing results on the fetus specimen.""","The note refers to test results pertaining to a specimen from the fetus, without adding material, condition, or other attributes. Category: Specimen. SCTID 309502007 (Fetus specimen) is the most accurate code. The parent Specimen lacks the fetal source detail, and children/siblings that specify substance types would be too narrow. The follow-up context is purely narrative and does not alter the coding."
442072000,Primary closed reduction of fracture dislocation of joint and internal fixation of joint (procedure),Primary closed reduction and internal fixation addressing fracture‑dislocation of joint,"The phrase indicates a primary closed reduction with internal fixation to address a joint fracture‑dislocation. Category: Procedure. SNOMED CT 442072000 matches the components exactly: primary, closed reduction, fracture‑dislocation, and internal fixation of the joint. It avoids specifying joint type, which would move to a child concept, and excludes open techniques or external fixation. The wording is a semantically equivalent paraphrase sustaining the exact code selection."
223971005,Gwent (geographic location),Home area: Gwent,"The expression indicates home area but the specific geographic entity is 'Gwent.' This aligns with the Geographic location (Location) hierarchy, and SCTID 223971005 corresponds to Gwent itself. Selecting Wales or UK would be too general, and any town within Gwent would be too specific. The wording is a paraphrase that preserves the same location concept."
734379005,Specimen from periodontal tissue (specimen),Periodontium tissue sample,"This phrasing clearly identifies a tissue specimen obtained from the periodontium, i.e., periodontal tissue, without specifying method or substructure. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the precise concept is 'Specimen from periodontal tissue' (SCTID: 734379005). More generic parent concepts fail to capture the site specificity, while child concepts that imply biopsy, swab, or subsites like gingiva are not supported by the wording. 'Periodontium' is a clinically equivalent synonym for periodontal tissue, ensuring the same code is appropriate."
258777001,Katal (qualifier value),Measurement unit selected: kat (katal),"The entry explicitly selects “kat (katal)” as the measurement unit, using both symbol and full name, which are clinically equivalent. This identifies the Qualifier value for catalytic activity, mapped to SNOMED CT Katal (qualifier value) 258777001. It refrains from introducing prefixes or denominators, avoiding mismaps to related sibling units like microkatal or kat per liter."
712653003,Delivery by cesarean section for footling breech presentation (finding),Operative delivery: cesarean section for footling breech,"This entry documents an operative delivery via cesarean section with the specific indication of footling breech, which corresponds exactly to the Clinical finding 712653003. While 'operative delivery' is a general context phrase, the explicit 'cesarean section for footling breech' is the key content. Broader cesarean delivery findings lacking the footling subtype or procedural concepts without indication are less appropriate."
367607007,Structure of detrusor muscle of urinary bladder (body structure),Bladder detrusor muscle,"This synonym uses ‘bladder’ in place of ‘urinary bladder’ while retaining ‘detrusor muscle,’ maintaining specificity to the same anatomical structure. Category is Body structure. No state or clinical context beyond anatomy is provided. It maps exactly to 367607007 because it denotes the detrusor muscle layer and not other bladder tissues. Parent concepts such as general bladder muscle are broader; siblings like bladder mucosa or serosa are not indicated by this term."
1296748009,No evidence of glaucoma of right eye (situation),No evidence of glaucoma of right eye.,"The statement explicitly conveys the absence of evidence for glaucoma in the right eye, with clear laterality. The main concept is the non-detection of glaucoma affecting the right eye. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 1296748009 is the most precise match because it encodes the context of absence (“no evidence”) and specifies the right eye. Broader parent concepts like “No evidence of glaucoma” lack laterality, and sibling/child concepts that specify glaucoma type (e.g., open-angle) or different eyes would be inaccurate. The wording does not introduce severity, timing, cause, or associated conditions—only the absence of evidence in the right eye."
1366172001,Presence of intraductal carcinoma and/or cribriform carcinoma in malignant neoplasm of prostate in excised specimen (observable entity),Presence of IDC-P and/or cribriform carcinoma in prostate cancer resection specimen,"Using IDC-P (intraductal carcinoma of the prostate) as a clinical synonym, this entry describes the observable concerning presence of intraductal and/or cribriform carcinoma in an excised/resection specimen of malignant prostate neoplasm. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. ‘Resection specimen’ is equivalent to excised specimen. The entry is best coded to SCTID 1366172001 rather than to a generic parent, a biopsy-sibling, or a child restricted to a single morphology. No yes/no outcome or extra attributes are included."
278340005,Structure of T4 spinal ganglion (body structure),Spinal ganglion at T4 level,"This entry designates the anatomical dorsal root (spinal) ganglion at the T4 vertebral/nerve level, a Body structure. It aligns directly with Structure of T4 spinal ganglion (278340005) by specifying the exact level (T4) and ganglion type (spinal), without introducing laterality or pathology. Parent concepts such as Structure of spinal ganglion lack the level specificity, and sibling level concepts like T3 or T5 spinal ganglion are not appropriate. The wording distinguishes it from sympathetic chain ganglia, ensuring precise mapping to the T4 DRG."
217524007,Accident caused by clothes on fire from burning bedspread (event),EMS handoff: clothes on fire resulting from burning bedspread,"The handoff note describes an event where clothes are on fire as a result of a burning bedspread, articulating an accidental external cause. This is an Event and maps precisely to SCTID 217524007. Parent event codes like general fire accidents or clothes-on-fire without source specificity are less precise, and sibling concepts with different sources (e.g., burning mattress) would not match the statement. The EMS context is purely narrative and does not add attributes that would alter coding."
312249003,Grenz radiation (physical force),Reference: Grenz radiation,"The entry references Grenz radiation as a concept, describing the radiation agent itself and nothing more. Category: Physical force. SCTID 312249003 is the most accurate code. Parent concepts such as X-ray radiation would be too generic, and related procedural or exposure concepts are not indicated, since no purpose or event is mentioned."
702939007,Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus intermedius (finding),Staph aureus/intermedius present,"Uses a common shorthand 'Staph' for Staphylococcus and presents a slash to indicate an either/or between aureus and intermedius. The main concept is presence of one of the two organisms, categorized as a Clinical finding. SCTID 702939007 is the most precise match because it encodes the exact disjunction. A sibling like 'Staphylococcus aureus present' or 'Staphylococcus intermedius present' would not reflect the uncertainty between the two, and a broader 'Staphylococcus present' would lose specificity. No additional attributes are introduced."
242963008,Sexual assault with penetration of vagina with foreign body (event),Forced vaginal penetration by foreign body in sexual assault,"This entry denotes a sexual assault characterized by forced penetration of the vagina using a foreign body, aligning exactly with the defined event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Code 242963008 is the most precise selection as it captures sexual assault with foreign body vaginal penetration. Using the general Sexual assault (event) would be too broad, and sibling concepts involving penile penetration or different sites are not supported by the wording. “Forced” reflects the non-consensual nature inherent in sexual assault and does not change the concept; “foreign body” and “vaginal penetration” are consistent with the target code."
242243007,Accident to spacecraft on re-entry (event),Documented spacecraft accident on re-entry,"This documentation-style phrasing specifies a spacecraft accident occurring on re-entry, with attributes: spacecraft, accident, and re-entry phase. In SNOMED CT, this is an Event and matches 'Accident to spacecraft on re-entry' (242243007). Without the re-entry qualifier, parent concepts are too broad; siblings focused on other phases would misrepresent the timing. No mention of a specific mechanism or sequela is present, so narrower child concepts are inappropriate. The documentation framing does not alter the underlying concept."
122704003,Specimen from endometrium obtained by biopsy (specimen),Endometrial biopsy—specimen,"The wording indicates that the subject is the specimen associated with an endometrial biopsy, i.e., tissue from the endometrium obtained via biopsy. This is a Specimen category concept. The exact SNOMED CT concept is 122704003 'Specimen from endometrium obtained by biopsy'. A procedure concept like 'Biopsy of endometrium' would be incorrect because the entry references the specimen itself, and more general specimen concepts would omit either site or method. The hyphenated style is a common documentation format and does not add attributes."
364198000,Frequency of urination (observable entity),Bladder diary: frequency of urination,"In the context of a bladder diary, this refers to the recorded parameter of urination frequency, which is a measurable observable property. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, making SCTID 364198000 the best fit. The wording avoids indicating abnormal frequency or nocturnal specificity, thus not mapping to findings like urinary frequency or nocturia. The diary context does not change the underlying concept."
706944002,Free hemoglobin (substance),Acellular hemoglobin,"‘Acellular hemoglobin’ refers to hemoglobin not contained within cells, synonymous with free hemoglobin. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 706944002 is appropriate because the entry denotes the specific substance form and does not introduce attributes like specimen location, abnormality, or isoform. Broader hemoglobin concepts or observables are not indicated."
328191000119106,History of great vessel repair (situation),Known history of great vessel repair,"This short entry conveys an established past repair of a great vessel, aligning with the Situation category concept 'History of great vessel repair.' It does not add any qualifiers regarding the specific vessel or reason, keeping it at the correct abstraction level and avoiding children or sibling concepts. 'Known history of' is a clinically equivalent way of expressing that the patient has undergone this repair previously, maintaining the same code selection."
223829005,Zante (geographic location),Place name documented as Zante,"This entry states the documented place name is Zante, fitting the Location hierarchy under Geographic location. The documentation phrasing is contextual and does not narrow or broaden the concept; it still indicates the exact geographic entity matching SCTID 223829005. It does not suggest a district, town, or country, so parent/child/sibling alternatives are less accurate."
262287009,Whitcomb (qualifier value),Descriptor: Whitcomb,"Using ‘descriptor’ indicates a label choice; the core concept remains the named qualifier ‘Whitcomb’ with no clinical attribute attached. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, mapping to SCTID 262287009. Generic parents are too broad, and Whitcomb-labeled clinical entities would be incorrect because the wording does not imply a sign, device, or classification."
249629008,Anal verge finding (finding),Anal verge finding,"This phrase denotes an unspecified clinical finding localized to the anal verge, with no additional attributes such as morphology, severity, cause, or temporality. The concept category is Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 249629008 (Anal verge finding) is the most precise match because it encodes a finding specifically at the anal verge without implying any particular type of abnormality. Broader parents like anal region or anorectal findings lack the site specificity, while child/sibling concepts (e.g., lesion, fissure, pain at the anal verge) introduce morphological or symptomatic attributes not present here. 'Finding' is a standard synonym for a clinical finding and does not alter the code selection."
473066000,History of malignant neoplasm of testis (situation),History of malignant neoplasm of testis,"The entry explicitly states a past history context for a malignant neoplasm involving the testis. The main concept is the historical presence of testicular cancer without any current disease assertion. Category: Situation with explicit context. This matches SNOMED CT ‘History of malignant neoplasm of testis (situation)’ because it conveys a prior occurrence of malignancy in the testis. It is not the active disorder ‘Malignant neoplasm of testis (disorder)’, nor is it a family history or a more general ‘History of malignant neoplasm’ parent concept. The phrasing uses standard terminology equivalent to the preferred term and introduces no attributes such as laterality, histology, stage, timing beyond “history,” or treatment."
300567006,Spleen non-tender (situation),Negative for splenic tenderness,"The wording indicates a negative finding regarding splenic tenderness on exam, i.e., tenderness is absent at the spleen. The concept is a negated finding at a specific anatomical site, which is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 300567006 matches exactly. More general abdominal or quadrant-based non-tender entries would be less precise, and splenic tenderness present would be a different finding. The term “negative for” is a conventional synonym signaling absence and does not introduce additional attributes."
214416005,"Motor vehicle traffic accident due to motor vehicle going out of control due to failure of mechanical part, without collision on the highway, passenger on motor cycle injured (event)","Trauma mechanism: Road traffic incident on expressway—motorcycle passenger, mechanical failure-induced loss of control, no collision.","This mechanism of injury describes an Event: a road traffic incident on an expressway (highway), with loss of control due to mechanical failure, no collision, and the injured person is a motorcycle passenger. SNOMED CT 214416005 aligns with these explicit attributes. Parent concepts (e.g., general traffic incidents) are too broad, and sibling concepts involving collisions or drivers are not appropriate. 'Expressway' is interchangeable with 'highway' in clinical context, and 'mechanical failure-induced loss of control' matches 'motor vehicle going out of control due to failure of mechanical part,' preserving code accuracy."
258549008,Skin scale specimen (specimen),Specimen identifier: skin scale,"The specimen is identified as skin scale, and no additional qualifiers such as anatomical subsite, collection method, or test purpose are provided. This is a Specimen in SNOMED CT. Skin scale specimen (258549008) precisely reflects the specimen material. A generic parent like Skin specimen would be insufficiently specific, while siblings such as Skin scraping specimen introduce a method not stated here. The identifier context does not change the underlying concept."
217921005,Accidentally drowned by machinery (event),Accidental drowning due to machinery,"This entry conveys an unintentional drowning with machinery as the cause using the causal phrase 'due to.' Main concepts: accidental drowning and machinery cause; no added qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Event. It maps most precisely to SCTID 217921005 because both accidental nature and machinery causation are explicit. The broader parent 'Accidental drowning (event)' lacks the machinery cause, while any child specifying a particular type of machinery would be over-specified. Siblings like 'Near drowning due to machinery' or non-drowning machinery events would be incorrect given the wording."
127479004,Specimen from uterus (specimen),Pathology received: specimen from uterus,"Main concept: pathology intake of a specimen whose source is the uterus. The entry avoids specifying tissue layer, whole organ, or collection technique. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The phrase directly corresponds to 'Specimen from uterus,' supporting SCTID 127479004. Parent categories are too broad and children (e.g., 'Resected uterus specimen' or 'Endometrial specimen') add attributes not stated. No sibling anatomical site is indicated, confirming specificity."
412941009,Urine ethanolamine measurement (procedure),Analytical measurement of ethanolamine in urine,"This expression specifies an analytical lab procedure measuring ethanolamine in a urine specimen, with no mention of timing, method, or additional qualifiers. It is a Procedure and aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 412941009. Parent concepts encompassing broader urine analyses or ethanolamine measurement in general are too vague, and more specific children (e.g., 24-hour urine or qualitative-only tests) are not stated. “Analytical measurement” is a common synonym and does not change code selection."
1306630006,Photographic extraoral image of full face with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Dental imaging: extraoral full-face photo captured with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion,"This entry refers to a captured photographic artifact that is extraoral, full-face, with relaxed lips and teeth in centric occlusion, precisely matching SCTID 1306630006 (Record artifact). Broader artifact categories without these specifics are less appropriate; sibling concepts involving different lip/mouth positions (smile, retraction) or intraoral views would not fit. The term “dental imaging” provides context but does not reframe it as a procedure, keeping the mapping to the record artifact."
161586000,History of injury (situation),History of injury,"The main concept expressed is a prior occurrence of injury documented as part of the person’s medical background. No site, mechanism, severity, or timing details beyond the past context are provided. This is a Situation concept in SNOMED CT. The most precise match is SNOMED CT 161586000 History of injury (situation), which represents the contextualized statement that injury occurred in the past. Mapping to Injury (disorder) would imply a current condition rather than past history, and mapping to history of a specific injury (e.g., head injury) would add attributes not present here. The wording directly matches the preferred term, making alternative parents or siblings less appropriate."
439949001,Evaluation of ulcer healing (procedure),Evaluated ulcer healing,"The entry conveys that the healing of an ulcer was evaluated, with no added details such as site, type, or outcomes. This is a Procedure. The phrasing is a concise paraphrase of Evaluation of ulcer healing and remains clinically equivalent to SCTID 439949001. More general evaluation procedures or evaluation of wound healing would be too broad, and any child concept pinning down ulcer subtype or anatomical location is not indicated here."
1366173006,Presence of cribriform carcinoma in malignant neoplasm of prostate in excised specimen (observable entity),Presence confirmed: cribriform carcinoma in excised malignant prostate tumor,"This entry confirms the presence of cribriform carcinoma in an excised specimen from a malignant prostate tumor, which aligns with an observable presence assessment. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 1366173006 is the most specific code, representing presence of cribriform carcinoma in malignant neoplasm of prostate in an excised specimen. The word “confirmed” still denotes presence without adding extent or severity. Disorder codes or parent observables lacking the cribriform qualifier, as well as sibling observables referencing biopsy or absence, would be inappropriate."
1363030009,Hospital-based outpatient emergency care center observation unit (environment),ED observation unit — hospital-based outpatient,"The entry specifies an ED observation unit and qualifies it as hospital-based outpatient, which is equivalent to an emergency care center observation unit in a hospital outpatient setting. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This aligns directly with SCTID 1363030009. Using 'ED' is a clinically accepted synonym for emergency care center; the dash does not add attributes. More general ED observation unit concepts without the hospital-based outpatient qualifier would be less precise, and inpatient or free-standing units would be incorrect."
440794009,Roseospira marina (organism),Roseospira marina,"The entry explicitly names the organism Roseospira marina, which is a taxonomic species concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The precise match is SNOMED CT 440794009 Roseospira marina (organism) because the text denotes only the species name without any clinical qualifiers. Broader parent concepts such as Roseospira (genus) or Bacteria would be less specific, and child concepts like particular strains are not referenced. No attributes such as infection, specimen, timing, or severity are introduced, so the organism concept is the correct and most granular code."
247692004,Delusion of control of voice (finding),Delusion of control of voice,"The entry explicitly names the preferred term and directly describes the belief that the person's voice is under control, which is the defining content of SCTID 247692004. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT, not a disorder or a symptom of a speech motor impairment. The concept matches precisely because it denotes the specific delusional passivity phenomenon affecting voice. Broader parents such as Delusion (finding) or Delusion of control (finding) are less specific, and siblings like delusion of control of movement or thought would not fit the voice-specific wording."
411831008,Rhizopus nigricans diagnostic allergen extract (product),Rhizopus nigricans diagnostic allergen product,"The term “product” correctly places the concept in the SNOMED product hierarchy and, coupled with “diagnostic allergen,” identifies the specific Rhizopus nigricans extract. SNOMED CT category: Product. This matches SCTID 411831008, whereas parent concepts omit organism detail and sibling concepts denote other species or therapeutic use. The wording avoids any new attributes like concentration, route, or clinical use beyond the diagnostic intent inherent to the concept."
120673008,Antibody to Coccidioides (substance),Anti-Coccidioides antibody,"The phrase explicitly denotes an antibody directed against Coccidioides, which is a substance concept rather than a test, result, or clinical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. There is no mention of immunoglobulin class (e.g., IgG or IgM), specimen, positivity/negativity, or testing method, so the most precise match is the substance concept Antibody to Coccidioides. Parent concepts like generic antifungal antibodies are too broad, and child concepts such as Coccidioides IgM/IgG antibodies are too specific. The synonym 'anti-' is standard clinical shorthand for an antibody targeting a specific antigen and does not alter the code selection."
701301007,"Stationary angiographic x-ray system, analog (physical object)",Analog stationary angiography X-ray system,"This denotes a stationary x-ray system used for angiography that operates in analog mode. Category: Physical object. The elements (angiography x-ray, stationary, analog) map directly to SNOMED CT 701301007. Choosing a parent like 'angiographic x-ray system' would be less precise, and a sibling like 'digital stationary angiographic x-ray system' would be wrong due to the analog specification. The phrase is a semantically equivalent paraphrase without added attributes."
399458003,Integrated N category (observable entity),Integrated N designation,"“Designation” is a near-synonym for category/classification and retains the same meaning: the integrated nodal category for staging. It is an Observable entity and introduces no values or ancillary attributes. Using a broader parent like a general N designation would be imprecise, while clinical/pathological N categories are narrower and exclude integration; thus, 399458003 is the best fit."
413546003,Annexin A6 (substance),Annotation term: ANXA6 protein,"This uses the symbol ANXA6 explicitly tied to 'protein,' disambiguating from the gene context and indicating the Annexin A6 substance without added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The best match is Annexin A6 (substance) [413546003]. Parent categories like Protein or Annexin are too general; sibling annexins are different entities. No mention of antibody, isoform, recombinant status, or measurement appears, so the base substance concept is the most accurate."
1162601008,Requires vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae (finding),Pneumococcal vaccination required for this patient,"The statement clearly reflects that the patient requires vaccination against pneumococcus, a Clinical finding of need. It avoids implying administration, refusal, or a particular vaccine product. SCTID 1162601008 exactly matches this specificity. Broader parent concepts lack the organism detail, and child concepts enumerating specific vaccine types or doses are beyond what is stated. 'Required' is a direct synonym for 'requires'."
174671003,Renewal of percutaneously inserted tubal prosthesis in bile duct (procedure),IR procedure: renewal of percutaneous bile duct stent,"This entry indicates an IR-performed renewal of a bile duct stent, specifying a percutaneous context. Main attributes: device = bile duct stent, approach = percutaneous, action = renewal/exchange. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The IR mention is contextual and doesn't change the procedural code. The combination of renewal and percutaneous approach matches the concept exactly. Sibling concepts like endoscopic exchange or simple removal are not appropriate, making SCTID 174671003 the correct code."
216365002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, hockey field (environment)",Hockey field listed as place of occurrence.,"The entry states that the hockey field is the designated place of occurrence for the event, with no additional clinical attributes. This is an environmental location concept in SNOMED. SCTID 216365002 best fits because it explicitly represents the place of occurrence at a hockey field. Broader or different venues are not supported by the wording. The phrasing is equivalent to the FSN intent and does not alter the semantics beyond identifying the location."
450360000,Coronary artery calcium score (observable entity),"Patient statement: ""my CAC score""","Despite the patient-reported context, the phrase refers to the coronary artery calcium score observable without giving values or interpretations. The category is Observable entity, corresponding to Coronary artery calcium score (SCTID: 450360000). It is not a procedure term or a finding of calcification; using the CAC abbreviation is a clinically accepted synonym and does not alter code selection to a parent or sibling concept."
32641000087102,Specimen from abscess of ovary (specimen),Surgical specimen from ovarian abscess,"The entry describes a specimen obtained in a surgical context with source being an ovarian abscess. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The surgical context does not add collection type (e.g., tissue vs fluid) and thus remains within the general specimen concept. This matches “Specimen from abscess of ovary” (SCTID 32641000087102). It is more specific than a parent lacking either the site or lesion and avoids children that would specify material or method. It is not the disorder."
838425008,Thermal dilution peripheral artery catheter (physical object),Thermodilution peripheral artery catheter device,"The entry identifies a device that is a thermodilution catheter for a peripheral artery, making the physical object explicit with the word 'device'. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the best match is Thermal dilution peripheral artery catheter (SCTID 838425008). Parent device classes such as generic 'arterial catheter (device)' are insufficiently specific because they omit the thermodilution capability. Siblings for different arterial targets (e.g., pulmonary artery) or different functionalities (e.g., pressure-only catheters) are less appropriate. 'Thermodilution' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'thermal dilution.'"
312025007,Human hair - material (substance),Listed material: human hair,"The entry presents human hair as a listed material, which places it squarely in the Substance domain and maps to Human hair - material (substance), SCTID: 312025007. It does not imply anatomical structure, specimen context, or any clinical attribute. Parent classes (e.g., hair material) lack the specificity of human origin, and sibling concepts like animal hair or anatomical hair are excluded by the wording. The phrasing is semantically equivalent and maintains the precise code."
118365005,Infrared laser beam (physical force),Imaging report: infrared laser beam,"Used in the context of an imaging report, the concept mentioned remains the infrared laser beam as a physical force. The category is Physical force. No added attributes (e.g., purpose, exposure, injury) are included, so it still maps precisely to SCTID 118365005. It is not a generic laser beam nor a different spectral type, and it avoids device/procedure coding."
218090000,Accident caused by machine gun (event),Patient reports an accident with a machine gun,"In patient-reported context, the statement describes an accidental event caused by a machine gun, without adding injury specifics or intent beyond accident. The main concept is a machine gun accident; context is documentation style only. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Parent firearm-accident codes would be too broad, and intent-coded siblings (assault/self-harm) would be inconsistent with “accident.” There’s no discharge-specific narrowing. SCTID 218090000 is the precise match."
866040002,Antidiabetic drug therapy observation (observable entity),Medication therapy observation (antidiabetic),"Main concept: observation of medication therapy specifically antidiabetic. Category: Observable entity. Parenthesized qualifier clarifies the scope without adding attributes. This cleanly maps to 866040002. A generic medication therapy observation would be too broad, and concepts involving therapy status, presence/absence, or monitoring procedures are not stated here."
702812003,Acute pain clinic (environment),Acute pain clinic (environment),"The entry explicitly specifies the environment, ensuring it denotes a physical location for acute pain care. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The code 702812003 Acute pain clinic (environment) precisely matches. Choosing a parent such as 'Pain clinic (environment)' would lose the acute qualifier, and choosing a sibling like 'Acute pain unit' or an organizational service would be incorrect because the text is about the clinic setting. The parenthetical term reiterates the environment without adding extra attributes."
228455003,Time since stopped being sexually active (observable entity),Time since the patient ceased sexual activity,"This phrasing indicates a time measure since cessation of sexual activity, aligning with SNOMED CT 228455003 in the Observable entity hierarchy. It does not add values or causes. Choosing this concept is more specific than a generic time-since observable and distinct from sibling findings of current sexual inactivity or measures of time since last sexual encounter. ‘Ceased sexual activity’ is a clinically safe paraphrase of ‘stopped being sexually active.’"
470109008,Femoral artery/vein catheter (physical object),Femoral artery–vein catheter (vascular device),"The entry identifies a vascular device that is a catheter for femoral artery or femoral vein, stated together as artery–vein. This is a Physical object and fits SCTID 470109008 by delineating the femoral site and the vascular target without narrowing to one vessel type. It avoids mapping to broader device categories and avoids child concepts that would require specifying artery-only or vein-only. The added parenthetical “vascular device” is a neutral descriptor that does not introduce any new attributes."
223785005,North Island (geographic location),"Reporting site: North Island, NZ","This line names the reporting site as North Island in New Zealand, but the coded concept is purely the location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and the correct selection is 'North Island (geographic location)' SCTID 223785005. Using the parent 'New Zealand' would lose specificity; selecting a child city or a sibling island would miscode. The context label 'Reporting site' is not an attribute that changes the geographic entity."
263762005,Friction (physical force),Friction noted in documentation,"This documentation phrase singles out friction, adding no injury, severity, site, or timing attributes. It corresponds directly to Friction (physical force), SCTID 263762005, under the Physical force category. Using the parent Physical force would lose specificity, and sibling forces such as shear or pressure are not indicated. The entry does not denote an injury or exposure, so disorder or event child concepts do not apply."
122683000,"Specimen from left kidney, inferior pole obtained by partial nephrectomy (specimen)","Tissue sample from left kidney inferior pole, collected during partial nephrectomy.","The statement defines a specimen (tissue sample) with clear source context: left kidney, inferior pole, and collection method by partial nephrectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This maps directly to SCTID 122683000. Parent concepts are less specific and omit either intrarenal location or method, and sibling concepts specify different laterality or procedures (biopsy, radical). “Tissue sample” is a routine synonym for specimen in pathology submission wording and does not add attributes."
242527004,Burning caused by hydrochloric acid (event),Hydrochloric acid–induced burning.,"The concept is a burning event induced by hydrochloric acid, with no additional attributes. This aligns with the Event hierarchy in SNOMED CT, describing a causative occurrence. SCTID 242527004 is the most precise code because it directly captures burning caused by hydrochloric acid. Parent nodes such as “Burning caused by chemical (event)” are less specific, and related exposure-only concepts do not assert burning. The term ‘induced’ is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of ‘caused by’ and does not alter the meaning or code selection."
183043007,Children reassured (situation),Care plan documentation: children reassured.,"This entry indicates the care plan records that children were reassured. The concept is reassurance targeted to children, aligning with the Situation Children reassured (183043007). The documentation label does not introduce additional attributes or change the recipient group, keeping it distinct from parent concepts like general reassurance or sibling concepts involving parents or family."
258521001,High vaginal swab (specimen),Diagnostic specimen: high vaginal swab,"The entry presents a diagnostic specimen identified as a high vaginal swab, making the SNOMED CT category Specimen appropriate. The site-specific qualifier ‘high vaginal’ ensures selection of SCTID 258521001 as the most precise code. A generic vaginal swab specimen would be less specific, and alternative site swabs would be incorrect. Mentioning ‘diagnostic specimen’ provides context but does not add attributes that change the concept; it remains the specimen."
242755002,Accident caused by paper cutting guillotine (event),Accident with paper cutting guillotine apparatus,"The word 'apparatus' is a harmless synonym for the device and maintains the specificity of the paper cutting guillotine without introducing new attributes. This is an Event and maps to SCTID 242755002. Choosing a more general machinery accident code would reduce specificity, and other device siblings do not match the guillotine apparatus noted here."
30436008,Hydrophis lapemoides (organism),Hydrophis lapemoides taxonomic label,"This entry presents Hydrophis lapemoides as a taxonomy label, indicating the species name without extra attributes. It corresponds to the Organism category and the species-level concept 30436008 in SNOMED CT. Parent genus or sibling species would be less precise; the phrasing does not imply clinical events or properties."
1268870000,Micropterus salmoides immunoglobulin E (substance),IgE to largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides),"This entry identifies the IgE antibody targeting largemouth bass and clarifies the scientific name Micropterus salmoides, ensuring specificity without conveying any test outcome. The main concept is the allergen-specific IgE substance for this organism. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 1268870000 is precisely aligned with this analyte; generic IgE or fish allergen IgE would be parent-level and less specific, while siblings would reference different species. The synonym is a clear restatement that remains clinically equivalent."
4311000179106,Chemical pathology report (record artifact),Chemical pathology report referenced,"The core concept is a chemical pathology report, with 'referenced' indicating it was cited or used, not altering the artifact itself. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The most precise mapping is Chemical pathology report (record artifact), SCTID: 4311000179106. No additional clinical or content attributes are introduced that would shift coding to a parent category or a different specialty report."
428617003,Product containing integrase strand transfer inhibitor (product),HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor–containing product,"This phrasing references the HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor class (INSTI) contained within a product. The mention of HIV reflects the standard clinical context of integrase strand transfer inhibitors and does not add an extraneous indication attribute in this case. No dose, route, brand, or treatment status is introduced, so it fits the Product category. The exact match is SNOMED CT 428617003. Parent antiretroviral product concepts are too broad, while children naming a particular INSTI would be too specific. It avoids mapping to therapy or substance-only concepts, maintaining precision at the product level."
465026001,Assistive electrical shaver adaptor (physical object),OT note: trial of assistive electrical shaver adaptor,"An occupational therapy note referencing a trial still identifies the same Physical object—an assistive adaptor for an electrical shaver—without adding attributes like etiology or specific design features. Parents like 'Assistive device' lack specificity, and siblings pertaining to other grooming tools would not fit. The phrase maps directly to SCTID 465026001, with 'trial' as contextual information only."
729340006,Entire supraclavicular nerve (body structure),Index term: supraclavicular nerve,"“Index term” is contextual, but the core concept is the supraclavicular nerve as an anatomical entity. No additional attributes (e.g., laterality, branch, injury) are introduced. This maps to SNOMED CT Body structure with SCTID 729340006. Using the entire-nerve concept is more appropriate than a parent like “Structure of supraclavicular nerve,” and there is no wording that would imply a child branch or side-specific variant."
443591004,Structure of common right pulmonary vein (body structure),Right pulmonary vein common trunk (anatomy),"This entry states the anatomical structure as the 'common trunk' for right pulmonary veins. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It matches SCTID 443591004. Using 'anatomy' clarifies that this is a structural reference, avoiding misinterpretation as a finding or disorder. It is more precise than parent concepts and does not mention child elements like ostium, branches, or variant features."
170775008,Diabetes: shared care program (finding),Diabetes shared care program—follow-up notes indicate program participation,"The entry states that follow-up notes indicate the patient participates in a diabetes shared care program, reflecting a care participation finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 170775008 directly encodes the diabetes shared care program concept. Parent generic shared care or sibling care plan/referral/pathway concepts would not match the wording’s specificity. The follow-up context is documentation provenance and does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
767413000,Salmonella typhimurium antiserum (substance),Microbiology report lists Salmonella Typhimurium antiserum among reagents,"The report context still references the substance Salmonella Typhimurium antiserum and does not introduce properties like antigen subtype, potency, or manufacturer. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The exact match is Salmonella typhimurium antiserum (substance), SCTID 767413000. A parent like 'Salmonella antiserum' would omit the species-specific detail, and sibling concepts for other Salmonella species would be incorrect. No child-level antigen specification is present, so the Typhimurium antiserum concept is the most precise fit."
200156003,Death from sequela of direct obstetric cause (event),Cause of death: sequela of direct obstetric cause,"This is a cause-of-death statement indicating the event (death) and its cause as the sequela of a direct obstetric cause. Main concepts: death, sequela, direct obstetric cause. SNOMED CT category: Event. The wording matches SCTID 200156003 exactly. Broader parent concepts lack the specified cause; acute direct obstetric death concepts are not correct because 'sequela' indicates a late effect; indirect cause siblings do not apply as 'direct' is specified. The framing as a COD context does not change the underlying concept."
443767006,Peripheral antinuclear antibody pattern (finding),ANA HEp-2 pattern: peripheral,"HEp-2 cells are the standard substrate for ANA IFA; the entry identifies the pattern as peripheral. The main concept is the ANA pattern only, with no added titer, positivity, or disease associations. It is a Clinical finding and maps to SNOMED CT 443767006. More generic results or different pattern types are not implied. Reference to HEp-2 is methodological context and does not change the coded finding."
309185002,Oral cavity specimen (specimen),Mouth specimen,"This phrase identifies a specimen and uses 'mouth' as a clinically equivalent synonym for the oral cavity. The main concept is a specimen, with the source location being the mouth/oral cavity. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It fits 309185002 Oral cavity specimen (specimen) because 'mouth' and 'oral cavity' are synonymous in this context and no method or material is specified. Parent concepts are too generic, while child/sibling concepts like Oral swab specimen, Tongue specimen, or Saliva specimen are too specific and not indicated by the wording."
223684004,Yugoslavia (geographic location),Region: Yugoslavia,"Here Yugoslavia is identified as a region in the colloquial sense of a defined geographic area, without implying successor states or subdivisions. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, with SCTID 223684004 as the precise match. The text does not justify mapping to a broader parent or to sibling or child concepts; it names the place itself."
242274009,Accidental exposure to anticlimbing paint (event),Incident documentation: accidental exposure to anti-intruder paint,"Main concept: accidental exposure; substance: anti-intruder paint, a synonym of anticlimbing paint. SNOMED CT category: Event. 'Anti-intruder paint' is commonly used interchangeably with anticlimbing paint; thus the best code is Accidental exposure to anticlimbing paint (event), SCTID 242274009. No mention of route, injury, or intent beyond accidental, so more general or different-substance concepts are unsuitable."
122600000,Specimen from breast obtained by modified radical mastectomy (specimen),Operative note: breast specimen removed via modified radical mastectomy.,"The operative note context records removal of a breast specimen by modified radical mastectomy, specifying source and method. This aligns with the Specimen category and exactly matches the concept SCTID 122600000. Parent or sibling concepts that vary the procedure detail are less precise. The wording does not introduce extra attributes such as laterality or timing beyond the core concept."
1879000,Fluorescent antigen measurement (procedure),Fluorescent antigen test,"The phrase denotes a test that measures antigen using fluorescence. The category is Procedure. SCTID 1879000 is appropriate because it represents the procedural measurement of antigen via fluorescence. A parent concept like generic antigen test omits the method, and siblings like fluorescent antibody test (targeting antibody) or specific immunofluorescence subtypes would diverge from the stated scope. 'Test' here is equivalent to 'measurement' in procedural coding and does not add further attributes."
425854006,Julian day number (qualifier value),Report header shows Julian day number,"This entry indicates the report header displays dates in Julian day number, specifying the qualifier value type. It is categorized as a Qualifier value and maps to SNOMED CT 425854006. The wording introduces no numeric instantiation or time-of-day fraction; it only identifies the representation. Broader date-display qualifiers would be less precise, and alternatives like “Julian date” or “Modified Julian Day” are distinct constructs. Thus, Julian day number is the exact code."
411654002,Castanea sativa diagnostic allergen extract (product),European chestnut diagnostic allergen extract (Castanea sativa),"The entry uses the recognized synonym “European chestnut” with the species identifier and maintains the diagnostic allergen extract designation, indicating a product for allergy testing. SNOMED CT category: Product. This corresponds precisely to 411654002 by specifying both organism and diagnostic purpose. A parent generic allergen extract concept lacks the species and diagnostic intent, and siblings such as therapeutic extracts are excluded by the explicit diagnostic phrasing. The synonym remains clinically equivalent to Castanea sativa."
261751004,Constant current (physical force),Constant current signal,"“Constant current signal” indicates a signal characterized by constant current. The main concept is the physical force of current with a constant magnitude. Category: Physical force. It maps to SNOMED CT 261751004 because the defining property is constancy of the current. Parent concepts (electric current) are too general, and siblings (alternating or pulsed current) imply variability. Although the word “signal” provides context, it does not introduce attributes like therapy, exposure, or measurement values; therefore, the most precise code remains the constant current physical force."
70892006,Cryptosporidium agni (organism),Entry name: Cryptosporidium agni,"The text presents Cryptosporidium agni as the named entry, which refers to the organism species itself without clinical qualifiers. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Organism category, and SCTID 70892006 is the correct code for this specific species. No attributes such as infection state, host, or detection are introduced, avoiding observable or disorder concept mappings. Parent or sibling organism concepts would lack the species precision indicated here."
725022005,Referral to ophthalmologist declined by subject (situation),Decision recorded: patient declined ophthalmology specialist referral.,"This describes a documented decision that the patient declined a referral to the ophthalmology specialist, i.e., an ophthalmologist. Main concept: refusal by subject of an ophthalmologist referral. Category: Situation. SCTID 725022005 precisely fits. Parent concepts lack the ophthalmology target; sibling concepts like declined referral to other specialists or refusal of procedures do not match. 'Ophthalmology specialist' is a valid synonym for ophthalmologist, preserving equivalence without changing attributes."
16131008,Product containing antivenom (product),Pharmacy inventory: antivenom product,"This records a product containing antivenom within pharmacy inventory, which still describes the product concept rather than an administration or substance. There are no added attributes such as brand, formulation, dose, species, or route. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The best match is SCTID 16131008, which captures products containing antivenom. A more general parent category (e.g., pharmaceutical product) would omit the antivenom specificity, while child concepts focusing on particular antivenoms or presentations would be too specific for the generic inventory phrasing."
223767003,Mindanao (geographic location),Travel history location: Mindanao,"The entry names 'Mindanao' as the location referenced in travel history, with no additional qualifiers. Main concept: Mindanao (geographic location). Category: Geographic location. Code 223767003 is suitable because the location itself is Mindanao; the context 'Travel history' does not create a separate situation concept here, and we do not specify dates or sub-areas. Parent, sibling, or child concepts are not better fits because the focus is the exact island."
170223003,Child: refer for surveillance (procedure),Parent statement: my child was referred for surveillance,"This is a patient-reported context confirming that a referral for surveillance was performed for the child. The concept is still the procedural action of referring a child for surveillance, categorized as a Procedure in SNOMED CT. It maps to SCTID 170223003 since it clearly identifies a child and a surveillance referral without adding a specific surveillance type or reason. Alternatives like adult referral or screening are inconsistent with the wording."
1338033004,Methotrexate therapy (procedure),Receiving methotrexate therapy,"The phrase conveys the performance of therapy with methotrexate, aligning with the Procedure concept. It does not add attributes such as route, dosage, indication, schedule, or start/stop timing beyond the fact of therapy being received. Parents like drug therapy are too broad, and siblings (prescription, administration specifics, or current therapy situation) are not explicitly expressed. Thus, Methotrexate therapy is the most precise code."
103116002,Lymphocyte antigen CD42c (substance),Cluster of differentiation 42c antigen,"Expanding CD to 'cluster of differentiation' preserves the exact identity of CD42c while reframing the abbreviation. Category: Substance. No new attributes are added; it denotes the same antigen. Broader parent concepts (CD antigen) would be less specific, and siblings like CD42a/b/d represent different molecules. This is a clinically equivalent synonym for the same substance concept."
217926000,Accidental mechanical suffocation caused by machinery (event),Accidental mechanical suffocation involving machinery,"This wording expresses the accidental mechanical suffocation event and includes machinery as the involved cause, matching SNOMED CT 217926000 (Event). It is more specific than the parent accidental mechanical suffocation without a cause and does not introduce sibling mechanism types such as drowning or compression without suffocation. No additional clinical descriptors are present."
7174001,"Ultrasound peripheral imaging, B-scan (procedure)",B-scan peripheral ocular sonography,"This entry describes B-scan 'sonography' (a synonym for ultrasound) performed for peripheral ocular imaging. The main concept is the procedural B-scan ultrasound targeting the eye’s periphery. In SNOMED CT, it is a Procedure and matches Ultrasound peripheral imaging, B-scan (7174001). Parent concepts lacking the peripheral specification are broader and therefore less precise, while siblings such as A-scan or segment-specific imaging are not indicated. Using 'sonography' does not alter the modality, so the code remains appropriate."
711000112105,Ixodes ochotonae (organism),Ixodes ochotonae tick,"The concept expressed is the species-level tick Ixodes ochotonae, placing it within the Organism hierarchy. Adding 'tick' is a descriptive clarification of the organism class and does not change the species identity, so the specific species code 711000112105 is the most accurate match. A parent concept like 'Tick (organism)' or 'Ixodes (genus)' would be too general, and any sibling Ixodes species would conflict with the species-level designation explicitly provided."
223531008,Zambia (geographic location),Country identifier: Zambia,"“Country identifier” provides the context of a country value, and the specified entity is “Zambia” only. Category: Geographical location (Location hierarchy). The appropriate code is Zambia (geographic location), SCTID 223531008. No timing, event, or sublocation attributes are present; thus, parent/child/sibling concepts do not fit better."
420566009,Ammonia + eucalyptus oil (product),Ammonia plus oil of eucalyptus,"This entry uses 'oil of eucalyptus' as a common synonym for eucalyptus oil and pairs it with ammonia, indicating the same two-ingredient product. The concept maps to SNOMED CT 420566009 (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). No dose form, route, or strength is implied, so it avoids child concepts. Parent or sibling concepts lacking one of the ingredients would be less precise. The synonym does not alter the clinical meaning or code selection."
122571000119106,History of malignant cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (situation),Indication: patient with history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.,"This is a common imaging or procedure indication that records a past history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The main concept is CTCL in historical context with no added details. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It maps to 'History of malignant cutaneous T-cell lymphoma' because lymphoma is malignant, and 'cutaneous T-cell' provides the necessary specificity. More general parents would be insufficiently precise, and specific child variants are not indicated. No additional attributes such as timing detail, severity, or remission status are included."
432144006,Specimen from mediastinum obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Follow-up review of mediastinum FNA specimen,"The follow-up context references a specific specimen—an FNA specimen from the mediastinum—aligning with “Specimen from mediastinum obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy” (SCTID 432144006). Category: Specimen. No extra attributes such as guidance, lesion type, or subsite are added, keeping the mapping precise. A procedure code for FNA would be incorrect because the focus is on the specimen, and a parent specimen code without method would be under-specified."
216414006,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, public school (environment)",Location of event: public school campus,"This specifies that the event’s location was the public school campus, which is a general reference to the public school setting and remains consistent with SCTID 216414006. 'Campus' does not narrow to sub-areas; it indicates the overall school environment. Parent concepts are too broad, and child concepts for specific areas are not invoked. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the wording remains semantically equivalent to 'public school' as place of occurrence."
1003681006,Human immunodeficiency virus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage 0 (finding),Impression: CDC stage 0 HIV,"This entry presents the clinician’s impression that HIV is classified as CDC stage 0. The concept expressed is the stage finding. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding, best matched by Human immunodeficiency virus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage 0 (finding) [1003681006]. Sibling concepts (CDC stage 1–3, unknown) are excluded by the explicit stage 0 label, and parent disorder concepts lack the staging detail. The wording is a synonymical rearrangement and does not introduce new attributes."
763878009,Product containing macrolide (product),Drug category entry—macrolide-containing product,"This denotes a product entry under the macrolide category, which implies a medicinal product containing a macrolide. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It precisely fits 763878009 because it specifies macrolide content and avoids additional attributes. Parent concepts are too broad and child concepts naming individual macrolides would be too narrow for the category-level phrasing."
103357000,Palpable (qualifier value),Clinical exam finding value: palpable,The phrase explicitly positions 'palpable' as a value recorded for a clinical exam finding without further attributes. It belongs to the Qualifier value hierarchy. The optimal code is Palpable (qualifier value) 103357000. Choosing a more detailed finding or a negation would not align with the generic value stated here.
420781000,Wyoming (geographic location),"Wyoming, U.S.","The entry denotes the state Wyoming and abbreviates the country as U.S., maintaining the focus on the state-level geographic location. It maps to SNOMED CT Wyoming (geographic location), SCTID 420781000. The country mention is context, not a shift to the parent concept. No additional attributes or child localities are introduced."
224025008,District of Canadian province (geographic location),District of Canadian province,"The main concept expressed is a district that is located within a Canadian province, stated without any additional qualifiers. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Geographic location (Location). The wording precisely matches SCTID 224025008, which defines the class of districts within Canadian provinces. Broader parents such as Geographical location or Administrative district are too general and would lose the specific national and provincial context, while siblings like City of Canadian province, County of Canadian province, or District of Canadian territory are not appropriate because they refer to different administrative levels or jurisdictions. No child concept (e.g., a specific named district) is indicated, so the generic class-level code is the most accurate."
309166000,Ear swab specimen (specimen),Swab specimen from ear,"This phrase indicates a specimen that is specifically a swab and that its source is the ear. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps exactly to Ear swab specimen (309166000), since it combines specimen type and source site. Choosing a parent like Swab specimen would lose the anatomical specificity, and choosing children that mention external ear or ear canal would over-specify beyond the text. The wording is about the specimen and not the act of swabbing, so it does not represent a procedure."
122573005,Gastric contents specimen (specimen),Stomach contents submitted as specimen,"This statement specifies that stomach contents were submitted as a specimen, using 'stomach contents' as a direct synonym for gastric contents. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, best matched by Gastric contents specimen (122573005). Parent concepts would not capture stomach specificity, and siblings like gastric juice, gastric fluid, or vomitus differ in material type. The phrase does not imply collection method or additional attributes, keeping the code selection focused."
285667004,Electric charge (physical force),Electrical charge documented in report,"The entry conveys that the physical phenomenon of electrical charge is documented, with no added attributes like injury mechanism or measurement. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. The synonym “electrical charge” is equivalent to “electric charge,” and no shift occurs toward related concepts such as electric current or electric field. SCTID 285667004 remains the best fit."
16213451000119104,Right colic flexure biopsy specimen (specimen),Biopsy specimen from right colic flexure,"The entry denotes a specimen obtained via biopsy from the right colic flexure of the colon. Attributes explicitly present: specimen type (biopsy) and site (right colic flexure). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It aligns directly with SCTID 16213451000119104. It is not merely a procedure (biopsy) but the specimen, and it is not broader (e.g., colon biopsy specimen) nor different in site (e.g., left flexure), nor more detailed (e.g., endoscopic or mucosal), so parent, sibling, or child concepts are less appropriate."
51777006,"Pain self-management deficit, chronic (finding)",Patient reports impaired ability to self-manage chronic pain.,"A patient-reported statement describing impaired ability to self-manage chronic pain is still a Clinical finding of a self-management deficit with a chronic pain qualifier. The chronic attribute is explicit, making SCTID 51777006 the correct code. Parent concepts without chronic and sibling concepts (e.g., acute variants or general coping difficulties) would not be as precise given the focus on self-management of chronic pain."
708194008,Blood bank service (qualifier value),On-call coverage by the blood bank service,"This entry denotes the service type as blood bank service in an on-call context, which remains a service designation. The concept category is Qualifier value, mapping to SNOMED CT 708194008. Parent services are too broad, and siblings (e.g., Transfusion service) represent different scopes. The term ‘on-call coverage’ is administrative context only; it does not introduce procedural or clinical attributes, keeping the code selection focused on the blood bank service qualifier."
224822007,Marked crosswalk (environment),Roadway crosswalk with markings,"This entry denotes a crosswalk on the roadway that has markings, i.e., a marked crosswalk. The emphasis on markings aligns directly with the marked attribute, and mentioning ‘roadway’ reflects typical placement of crosswalks without adding a different environmental subtype. The SNOMED CT category is Environment; the best-matching code is “Marked crosswalk (environment)” SCTID 224822007. Using “Crosswalk (environment)” would be too general, and “Unmarked crosswalk” is inconsistent. More specific designs (zebra, raised, signalized) are not indicated, so the marked crosswalk concept is the most precise fit."
102414000,Water pollution (event),Water pollution noted,"This entry indicates recognition of a water pollution event, without specifying type of water, pollutant, severity, timing, or geography. The concept belongs to the Event hierarchy in SNOMED CT and maps directly to 102414000 Water pollution (event). Parent concepts like Pollution (event) are less specific, and sibling concepts (air or soil pollution) are incorrect media. There is no narrowing to a child such as drinking water pollution, so the general water pollution event is appropriate."
782379007,Structure of capsule of left intertarsal joint (body structure),Left-side intertarsal joint capsule,"Using 'left-side' expresses laterality equivalent to 'left' and points to the joint capsule of an intertarsal joint, a body structure. This entry corresponds to Structure of capsule of left intertarsal joint. It does not introduce any additional attributes or specify a particular intertarsal articulation, so child concepts are not warranted. A parent without laterality is less precise, and siblings with other joints or right laterality are clearly not intended."
443081000124107,Adult elemental anti-inflammatory GI intolerance critical care specialty formula (product),Adult elemental anti-inflammatory GI intolerance ICU nutrition specialty formula,"The entry indicates an ICU (critical care) specialty nutrition formula for adults that is elemental and anti-inflammatory, suitable for GI intolerance. The SNOMED CT category is Product. ICU is a clinically accepted synonym for critical care, so the concept remains identical. This set of qualifiers maps to SCTID 443081000124107. Broader ICU nutrition products or elemental products lacking the anti-inflammatory or GI intolerance designation would be less precise parent/sibling concepts."
87996002,Psychosocial status (social concept),Psychosocial status: intake,"The entry is a label indicating the psychosocial status item at intake, without asserting an assessment outcome or condition. The main concept is psychosocial status. Category: Social concept. SCTID 87996002 fits because it refers to the status construct at a documentation stage rather than a procedure or finding. Sibling concepts like psychosocial screening (procedure) or psychosocial stressor (finding/observable) would introduce different semantics not present in this neutral label."
423696009,Specimen from appendix and colon obtained by appendectomy and right colectomy (specimen),Appendix/colon specimen (appendectomy and right colectomy).,This concise label indicates the specimen includes appendix and colon and specifies it was obtained via appendectomy and right colectomy. It fits the Specimen hierarchy and maps directly to SCTID 423696009. Entries lacking the dual-source specification or the right-sided colectomy would map less precisely to parent or sibling concepts. The abbreviated style does not introduce new attributes beyond those in the concept.
679081000119106,Xerosis of bilateral corneas (finding),Bilateral corneal dryness,"“Corneal dryness” is a clinically equivalent synonym for corneal xerosis, and “bilateral” specifies both eyes. This expresses the Clinical finding of bilateral corneal xerosis and maps to SNOMED CT 679081000119106. Parent codes lacking laterality are less precise, while unilateral child codes would not match the bilateral descriptor. Sibling diagnoses such as conjunctival xerosis or dry eye disease would misidentify the anatomical site or mechanism. No extra attributes are present."
1306621003,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Capture: extraoral photo of right half-face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion.,"This indicates a captured extraoral photographic image of the right half of the face, specifying lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion. It is a SNOMED CT Record artifact best matched by SCTID 1306621003. Parent artifacts without lip closure or occlusal detail are too broad, and sibling artifacts expressing left side, full face, smile/open lips, or alternative occlusal positions are excluded by the text. 'Right half-face' is a synonymous expression of 'right half of face' without altering meaning."
1260098002,World Health Organization and International Society of Urological Pathology grading system for renal cell carcinoma (staging scale),Lab protocol: WHO/ISUP renal cell carcinoma grade scale,"This indicates a laboratory protocol that uses the WHO/ISUP grade scale for RCC, referring to the system rather than a grade outcome. The main concept is the RCC grading scale. SNOMED CT category: Staging scale. It corresponds precisely to 1260098002. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too generic or denote different grading/staging systems. ‘Grade scale’ is a synonymous expression for the same WHO/ISUP RCC scale and does not add new attributes."
79081000119100,History of acute myeloid leukemia (situation),Status post acute myeloid leukemia,"Here, “status post” is used to denote that AML occurred in the past, which sets a historical situation. There is no implication of current disease, remission status, treatment received, or subtype. This places the entry in the Situation with explicit context category and maps to “History of acute myeloid leukemia (situation).” Parent concepts (history of leukemia) are too general, and siblings involving other leukemia types or procedures (e.g., status post transplant) would be incorrect; no procedure or treatment is mentioned, maintaining focus on the history of AML."
422848003,Subfamily Columbinae (organism),Bird taxonomic subfamily Columbinae,"The entry states the bird taxonomic subfamily Columbinae, identifying the organism at the subfamily rank. The correct SNOMED CT category is Organism, with the exact concept Subfamily Columbinae (organism), SCTID 422848003. Referencing 'bird' is consistent with the inherent classification and does not direct to the parent family or to child genera/species. It is a clinically equivalent synonymic wording that preserves the precise mapping to the subfamily."
411898004,Acacia longifolia specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy testing reagent—Acacia longifolia extract (diagnostic),"The wording indicates an allergen extract used as a reagent for allergy testing, specifying Acacia longifolia and diagnostic use. Main concept: specific diagnostic allergen extract product. SNOMED CT category: Product. This fits 411898004, as it is neither a test procedure nor a therapy. Parent concepts are too broad without species designation, and therapeutic siblings are excluded by ‘diagnostic’. ‘Reagent’ and ‘extract’ are standard descriptors for the same product class and do not introduce new attributes."
39817001,Prothrombin fragment 1.2 (substance),Target molecule: prothrombin F1+2,"This entry presents the substance as a targeted molecule, still referring specifically to prothrombin fragment 1+2. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 39817001 best fits. The context does not add attributes like quantity or specimen, avoiding misclassification as an assay or result. Parent or sibling concepts would be too broad or different chemically."
420380001,Lensometer (physical object),Pretest area: lensmeter,"This notes a lensmeter present in the pretest area, naming the physical device. Category: Physical object. The correct specific code is Lensometer (physical object) SCTID 420380001. Parent categories like general ophthalmic equipment are too broad, and no child-level attributes (manual/digital/handheld) are stated. Sibling instruments (keratometer, autorefractor) are different and not implied. The entry is object-focused, not a procedure or measurement report."
439486008,Tetrasphaera elongata (organism),Microbiology organism: Tetrasphaera elongata,"The entry specifies the organism within a microbiology context, naming Tetrasphaera elongata and aligning with the Organism category and SCTID 439486008. The context does not assert detection, infection, or sample site; it only identifies the species. Therefore, broader parent taxa are not precise, and no strain-level child is implicated. The species-level organism concept is the best match."
257722007,Unpaved road (environment),Discharge planning: home on an unpaved road.,"The discharge plan notes the environmental feature of an unpaved road at the home setting; the planning context does not change the concept. It is an Environment or geographical location concept and corresponds to Unpaved road (environment), SCTID 257722007. Parent road concepts are less precise, and specific material subtypes are not present. The entry does not introduce causation, severity, or timing attributes."
182727003,Asthma control step 1 (procedure),Assign patient to asthma control step 1,"This documentation phrasing indicates the procedural action of assigning the patient to step 1 in the asthma control plan. The main concept remains the step 1 procedure, fitting SNOMED CT’s Procedure category. It does not specify medications, severity, or timing beyond the assignment context. Using another step would be a sibling concept; generic asthma management would be a parent. Therefore, 182727003 is the correct and most specific code."
110834005,Urinary bladder and vagina (combined site) (body structure),Anatomic reference: bladder and vagina,"This entry provides an anatomic reference limited to the bladder and vagina together, matching SNOMED CT concept 110834005 as a combined Body structure site. It adds no condition or procedural detail, staying purely anatomical. Parents (bladder-only or vagina-only) and alternative organ pairings as siblings would not match the stated combination. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym."
608848006,History of bariatric surgical procedure (situation),Prior bariatric surgical intervention,"“Intervention” here is a synonym for procedure, and “prior” indicates past occurrence, together indicating a history of bariatric surgery. This maps to the Situation concept “History of bariatric surgical procedure” SCTID 608848006. The main concept is a historical bariatric procedure; it avoids current-procedure coding and does not specify a subtype, thus not mapping to child concepts. The phrasing introduces no additional attributes beyond the history context, ensuring precise alignment with the target concept."
55566008,Accidental physical contact (event),Nursing documentation: accidental physical contact,"This indicates nursing recorded an event of accidental physical contact, with no additional qualifiers such as injuries, causes, or settings beyond the documentation context. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the appropriate code is Accidental physical contact (event) SCTID 55566008. More general parents would lose specificity, while siblings (collision, assault) introduce mechanisms or intent not present. The context prefix does not alter the underlying coded concept."
116207007,Liquid of non-biological origin (substance),Liquid from non-biologic source,"This wording highlights source rather than origin but remains equivalent: a liquid whose source is non-biological. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps to 116207007 without adding attributes such as use or hazard. Parent liquid concepts lack the source constraint, and specific child substances are not specified; biological-origin liquids would be incorrect given the source description."
609095001,Main spoken language Tetum (finding),Clinician summary: The patient's main spoken language is Tetum.,"This statement documents the clinical finding that Tetum is the patient's main spoken language, matching SCTID 609095001. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It is not describing preference, native language, or general speaking ability; it specifically denotes the main spoken language. Therefore, parent concepts are too broad and sibling concepts like preferred language are not exact given the wording."
313365006,Anal swab taken (situation),Clinic note: anal swab obtained,"The entry records that an anal swab was obtained, which is a Situation with explicit context and maps to 313365006 Anal swab taken (situation). The key attributes are site (anal) and state (obtained/taken). Parent-level concepts are too broad without the site, and sibling concepts for other locations would be inaccurate. The inclusion of “Clinic note” is contextual and does not introduce new attributes; “obtained” is clinically equivalent to “taken.”"
127457009,Tissue specimen from breast (specimen),Path note: this case contains breast tissue specimen,"The pathology note identifies the case as containing a breast tissue specimen, which is equivalent to a tissue specimen from the breast. The main concept is a specimen; attributes are limited to tissue material and breast origin. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. Broader parent terms that could include fluid or cytology are less precise, and child concepts implying collection method or laterality are not supported by the wording. The synonym maintains the correct code selection."
126113007,Medroxyprogesterone (substance),Test catalog analyte name: medroxyprogesterone,"The entry names medroxyprogesterone as an analyte in a catalog, focusing on the substance itself without indicating measurement results or ester forms. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Medroxyprogesterone (substance) SCTID 126113007 best fits. Observable findings or detection results would be different concepts, and sibling ester/product entities (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate) are not indicated by the wording."
49048008,"Electricity /220,440 volt/ (physical force)",Electricity at 220 or 440 volts,"This entry identifies electricity and explicitly constrains it to 220 or 440 volts, with no added clinical modifiers. It fits the Physical force semantic tag and corresponds most precisely to Electricity /220,440 volt/ (physical force), SCTID 49048008. Parent concepts lacking voltage detail are too broad, and children specifying one voltage only do not capture the '220 or 440' wording. Sibling concepts involving exposure or injury are not applicable since no event is described."
257668002,Domestic garden (environment),Garden located at patient’s residence,"This clearly positions the garden at the patient’s residence, indicating a domestic garden environment. It fits the Environment hierarchy and matches Domestic garden (environment), SCTID 257668002. The possessive context does not change the concept; no added attributes like time or event are present, and non-domestic garden concepts are excluded."
11007851000119102,History of right above elbow amputation (situation),Clinical history includes right above-elbow amputation.,"This statement captures the presence of a right above-elbow amputation in the patient's clinical history, indicating a historical Situation. The attributes specified are laterality (right) and level (above elbow), with no added details about timing or etiology. It maps to SCTID 11007851000119102, not to generic history items without level, not to the actual procedure, and not to left-sided or below-elbow variants."
258481002,Vaginal washout fluid specimen (specimen),Vaginal wash fluid specimen,"The concept is a specimen composed of fluid from a vaginal wash, i.e., a washout/lavage collection. This belongs to the Specimen hierarchy. 'Wash fluid' is a straightforward paraphrase of 'washout fluid' and remains clinically equivalent, thereby mapping precisely to SCTID 258481002. It excludes other specimen forms like swabs or secretions and is narrower than a general vaginal specimen, avoiding parent/sibling miscodes. The entry contains no other attributes."
788397008,Product containing placental hormone (product),Placental hormone content: medicinal product,"This phrasing identifies a medicinal product by its content (placental hormone), which aligns with the SNOMED Product concept 'Product containing placental hormone.' It does not name the particular placental hormone, avoiding child concepts, and the placental qualifier prevents assignment to the broader parent 'Product containing hormone.'"
438141008,Streptomyces durhamensis (organism),Organism entry: Streptomyces durhamensis,"This is a catalog or record-style designation naming Streptomyces durhamensis as the organism, aligning with SNOMED CT Organism concept SCTID 438141008. The entry does not include attributes of disease, growth, or timing; it is purely the taxon label. More general parents (e.g., Streptomyces) would not capture the species detail, and alternate species would be inaccurate given the exact wording."
110914008,Right upper lobe bronchus cytologic material (specimen),Right upper lobe bronchus cytology cells,"The term 'cytology cells' indicates cytologic material, and the site is the right upper lobe bronchus. This constitutes a Specimen and directly aligns with SCTID 110914008. Using 'cells' as a synonym for cytologic material is clinically acceptable and does not imply histology or different sample types. Parent and sibling concepts differ in site specificity or method, which are not added here."
80541000119104,History of nutritional deficiency (situation),Previous nutritional deficiency noted in chart,"The phrase identifies a past nutritional deficiency recorded in the patient’s chart, making it a historical situation rather than an active disorder. The main concept is a prior deficiency without specifying which nutrient or any additional attributes. This maps to the Situation with explicit context 'History of nutritional deficiency' (80541000119104). A child concept would require a specified nutrient (e.g., iron, vitamin D), which is absent here, and a disorder code would indicate current presence, which the wording does not support."
223795003,Donegal (geographic location),Destination: Donegal,"This entry specifies ‘Donegal’ as the destination, which is a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location — Geographic location. The travel context does not alter the place identity or add administrative specificity. Therefore, Donegal (223795003) is the most accurate code; parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling concepts suggesting town, county, or facilities would introduce detail not present in the text."
59920002,Structure of anterior choroidal artery (body structure),Vascular anatomy label: anterior choroidal artery,"As a labeling phrase, it still identifies the anterior choroidal artery as the anatomical structure of interest without introducing any additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This corresponds exactly to Structure of anterior choroidal artery (SCTID 59920002). A parent category would be too general and a child concept would imply laterality or substructure not stated; sibling vessels are distinct and not implied."
169604006,"Antenatal care: primiparous, older than 30 years (situation)","Prenatal follow-up for primipara, 40 years old.","Main concepts: prenatal (antenatal) follow-up care, primipara (primiparous), and age 40 (>30). SNOMED CT category: Situation. The entry is an exact fit for 169604006: prenatal care for a primiparous woman older than 30. Parent concepts without parity/age are less precise, and sibling concepts with different parity or specifically elderly primipara would add attributes not stated. 'Prenatal' and 'primipara' are clinically valid synonyms for antenatal care and primiparous."
257642009,Freeway roadway (environment),Motorway (freeway),"The term 'motorway' is a jurisdictional synonym for 'freeway', and the parenthetical clarifier ensures equivalence. This maps to Freeway roadway (environment), SCTID 257642009, within the Environment category. It does not add attributes such as toll status, urban/rural, or segment type; thus broader concepts like generic roadway or different siblings (e.g., street) are inappropriate, and child concepts like ramps or shoulders are not implicated."
729621005,Entire external rectal venous plexus (body structure),"External rectal venous plexus, entire structure","This phrasing identifies the external venous plexus of the rectum and clarifies that the reference is to the entire structure. Main concept: body structure anatomy, no added clinical qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. 'Entire structure' directs coding to SCTID 729621005 specifically, and avoids mapping to a sibling concept 'External rectal venous plexus' that might denote only part of the plexus. Parent concepts (e.g., 'Rectal venous plexus') are too general, and internal plexus siblings are excluded by 'external.'"
224860003,Specialist school (environment),Specialist school as learning environment.,"The phrase explicitly frames the environment of learning as a specialist school, which is an environment/location concept. The most accurate SNOMED CT mapping is 224860003 Specialist school (environment), within the Environment or geographical location category. Using a parent concept like School (environment) would ignore the specialist qualifier, and the entry does not state any specifics that would warrant a child or sibling concept."
397233003,Specimen from renal pelvis (specimen),Specimen originated in the renal pelvis,"The statement specifies the origin of the specimen as the renal pelvis, fitting the Specimen category and mapping to SCTID 397233003. It does not introduce specimen subtype, laterality, or collection method. Therefore, more general parents (e.g., kidney specimens) are less precise, while more specific children (e.g., tissue, urine, brushings from renal pelvis) would add details absent from the entry."
1345268005,Dip slide culture slide submitted as specimen (specimen),Accessioned specimen: dip slide culture slide.,"The wording indicates a specimen accession and precisely identifies the specimen as a dip slide culture slide, which matches the SNOMED CT Specimen concept (SCTID 1345268005). Category is Specimen. The accession context does not add attributes beyond specimen identity. Broader parents and different device siblings are excluded by the explicit 'dip slide culture slide' designation."
263355003,Structure of vaginal wall (body structure),Vaginal wall visualized,"An imaging or exam context indicates the anatomical vaginal wall was seen, but no additional attributes or pathology are stated. As a Body structure, the best SNOMED CT match is Structure of vaginal wall [263355003]. Mapping to 'vagina' is overly broad, and mapping to subcomponents (e.g., mucosal layer, anterior wall) would introduce precision that the phrase does not specify. The visualization context does not change the anatomical concept."
13016311000119104,History of retinal edema (situation),Follow-up note: history of retinal edema,"This follow-up context explicitly records a history of retinal edema, emphasizing prior occurrence rather than present findings. It aligns with the Situation concept History of retinal edema. Selecting a disorder concept would misrepresent the timing, and there is no suggestion of family history or subtype such as macular edema. No additional clinical attributes are introduced, keeping the mapping precise to the history situation."
175730007,Revision of reconstruction involving aorta (procedure),Follow-up documentation: revision of aortic reconstruction recorded,"This follow-up note references the exact procedure—revision of aortic reconstruction—corresponding to SNOMED CT 175730007. Concepts include aorta, reconstruction, and revision; there are no added specifics such as segmental anatomy, grafts, or approach. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Although contextualized in follow-up, the core procedure is unchanged. Parent concepts are overly broad, and child/sibling concepts introducing additional detail are not supported by the wording."
309914005,Audiology department (environment),Routing destination: Audiology department,"The routing destination indicates a target environment within a facility: the audiology department. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Environment or geographical location category, specifically Audiology department (environment) SCTID 309914005. The term remains at the department level and does not transition to clinic, unit, or service concepts, nor does it add qualifiers. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings like Audiology clinic are not stated, making this the precise code."
72302000,"Lead cable, device (physical object)",Lead cable provided to patient care area,"This notes provision of a lead cable to a care area, identifying the object as a device. It aligns with SNOMED CT 72302000 (Device, Physical object). The context of distribution does not introduce any attributes like device subtype or function. Parent terms (generic cable/device) are less specific, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., ECG lead, wire) are not indicated."
445678009,Email report (record artifact),Report by email,"The entry indicates the report is provided by email. Main concept: report; attribute: email channel. Category: Record artifact. Email report SCTID 445678009 is the precise fit, as the wording preserves the report nature and email modality and does not imply a different document type or communication event. The phrase is semantically equivalent and adds no extra attributes."
119352006,Macrophage specimen (specimen),Specimen containing macrophages,"The entry defines the specimen by its cellular composition—macrophages—without other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It precisely matches 119352006 “Macrophage specimen (specimen)” because it names macrophages as the content and does not add source or technique. A parent like “Immune cell specimen” would be overly broad, and a child such as “Alveolar macrophage specimen” would be too specific. The phrasing is an equivalent paraphrase."
130455007,Phosphatidylglycerol--membrane-oligosaccharide glycerophosphotransferase (substance),"Phosphatidylglycerol–membrane oligosaccharide glycerophosphotransferase, listed on report","This mentions the same enzyme within a reporting context, but the core concept referenced is the specific substance. No attributes beyond the enzyme’s identity and substrate specificity are introduced. SNOMED CT category is Substance. Contextual phrases like ""listed on report"" do not alter coding; the exact enzyme name maps to SCTID 130455007. Parent or sibling concepts would not match this specificity."
241367004,Radionuclide hysterosalpingography (procedure),Nuclear medicine uterotubography,"This entry uses 'uterotubography' (synonymous with hysterosalpingography) qualified by 'nuclear medicine,' indicating a radionuclide technique. The concept is a Procedure and maps to Radionuclide hysterosalpingography (SCTID 241367004). It is more specific than general uterotubography by naming the modality and does not refer to sibling modalities like fluoroscopy or ultrasound. The synonym and qualifier are clinically equivalent and keep the code selection unchanged."
90541000,Structure of superior margin of pancreas (body structure),Anatomy description: superior margin of the pancreas,Main concept: an anatomical description identifying the superior margin of the pancreas. No qualifiers for subparts or condition are included. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The phrasing targets the specific margin rather than the organ generally or other borders/surfaces. SCTID 90541000 is the exact match.
418991002,Sucked or chewed (qualifier value),"Follow-up note: ""sucked or chewed"" administration method","The entry captures that the administration method documented at follow-up is “sucked or chewed,” with no added attributes like dose or timing details beyond the method itself. Category: Qualifier value. It maps to SCTID 418991002 accurately; a parent method would be insufficiently specific, and single-method siblings would be overly narrow. The phrase is a context-aware restatement that maintains the qualifier’s exact meaning."
53246002,Ethylene (substance),Ethene referenced in documentation,"The entry references ethene—the IUPAC synonym for ethylene—within documentation but does not add attributes such as exposure or formulation. This is a Substance concept and maps to Ethylene (substance), SCTID 53246002. It does not signal a broader class (alkenes) nor a different chemical (ethylene oxide/glycol). The synonym is clinically equivalent to ethylene and does not change code selection, making the ethylene substance concept the most precise match."
165876001,Direct platelet antibody test (procedure),Direct platelet antibody laboratory test,"This entry describes a laboratory procedure for direct testing of antibodies on patient platelets. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. By specifying “direct,” it distinguishes from indirect assays and ensures specificity beyond the generic parent platelet antibody test. The wording does not introduce method, isotype, or context qualifiers like results or indications, making Direct platelet antibody test (165876001) the most accurate code rather than a parent or sibling concept."
1204479005,French Southern Territories (geographic location),French Southern Territories (TF),"Adding the ISO code indicator “TF” clarifies the same territorial entity without changing its identity. No attributes beyond the location name are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The precise concept is 1204479005; it is not France (parent), a subset (e.g., Crozet Islands), or another French territory (sibling). The synonymic notation remains codable to the same concept."
782431001,Prevotella pleuritidis (organism),Genus/species entry: Prevotella pleuritidis,"The phrase denotes a genus/species field populated with Prevotella pleuritidis, without implying any clinical findings or additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The correct match is Prevotella pleuritidis (organism), SCTID 782431001, which identifies this species specifically. Parent genus concepts are too broad and sibling species would be incorrect. The context of a form entry does not change the target concept."
1365866008,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror and corrected of mandible with mouth open (record artifact),Record artifact: mirror-corrected intraoral photograph of lower jaw with mouth open,"This entry identifies a record artifact that is a photographic intraoral image of the lower jaw (mandible), captured through a mirror and orientation-corrected, with the mouth open. The main concept is an artifact description, not a procedure or finding. It fits the SNOMED CT Record artifact category and maps to SCTID 1365866008. Parent or sibling artifacts that lack the lower jaw focus or the mouth-open specification would be less precise. The synonym “lower jaw” for mandible and “photograph” for photographic image are clinically equivalent and do not change the intended code."
122613006,Specimen from lung obtained by mediastinoscopic biopsy (specimen),Patient reports: lung tissue was biopsied via mediastinoscopy and sent as a specimen,"This patient-centered phrasing still conveys that a specimen of lung tissue was obtained by mediastinoscopic biopsy. The main concept is the specimen; attributes are lung source and mediastinoscopic method. Category: Specimen. Although it uses lay phrasing, it remains semantically equivalent and does not introduce additional attributes such as diagnosis, timing, or laterality. Thus, the exact specimen concept SCTID 122613006 is the most precise match."
169303009,Betatron photon therapy (procedure),Betatron X-ray photon therapy,"This entry combines standard synonyms 'X‑ray' and 'photon' to emphasize the radiation type and specifies betatron as the source. The main concept is photon radiotherapy via betatron. SNOMED CT category is Procedure. Betatron photon therapy (procedure), SCTID 169303009, is the appropriate code, since the device and particle are explicit. Parent concepts would be less specific, and siblings like electron therapy or different photon sources would be incorrect. The dual wording 'X‑ray photon' does not introduce new attributes; it reiterates the photon nature."
242537009,Exposure to man-made ultraviolet light (event),Exposure to engineered ultraviolet light,"The term 'engineered ultraviolet light' denotes an artificial/man-made source and describes an exposure event without extra attributes. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Event category 'Exposure to man-made ultraviolet light (event)'. Using a parent concept for unspecified UV exposure would miss the artificial aspect, and specifying therapy or device would be inappropriate since the entry remains generic to artificial UV."
242502006,Burning due to contact with hot water in bath (event),Burn event associated with hot bath water contact.,"The entry identifies a burn event associated with contact with hot water in a bath, emphasizing the mechanism and setting. It does not introduce other attributes (site, severity, intent, timing). The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the specific mapping is to 242502006 because of the bath-specific hot water contact. Broader parent events (hot liquid exposure) or unrelated siblings (steam, shower) do not fit. The phrasing is clinically equivalent and maintains code precision."
1187646006,South Sandwich Islands (geographic location),Follow-up planned in the South Sandwich Islands,"The phrase places follow-up in a location, but the codable concept is the geographic place 'South Sandwich Islands.' It does not add clinical qualifiers beyond context. In SNOMED CT, this is a Geographic location, mapped precisely to 1187646006. A parent like 'Geographic location' would be too broad, while broader territorial siblings including South Georgia would not align with the specific wording. Child concepts for single islands would be narrower than intended."
314530002,Medication review done (situation),Medication review concluded.,"The entry indicates that the review process reached conclusion, i.e., completion, aligning with Medication review done (SCTID 314530002), a Situation concept. It does not introduce other attributes such as reasons, changes, or who did it. Concepts indicating pending or in-progress status would be mismatched because the language indicates completion. “Concluded” is equivalent to “completed/done” in this context, so the selected code is the most accurate fit."
721924002,Overall plan of care (record artifact),Master plan of care,"The term 'master' conveys the same meaning as 'overall'—a single, top-level plan-of-care document—without introducing new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It matches Overall plan of care (record artifact) SCTID 721924002, as it denotes the primary overarching plan rather than a component plan. Broader parent entries are less specific, and siblings like treatment plan are narrower and do not reflect the overall cross-cutting plan."
429125006,History of lymphadenopathy (situation),Prior lymphadenopathy documented,"The phrase indicates that lymphadenopathy occurred previously and has been recorded, which fits the Situation category rather than a current clinical finding. It maps to SNOMED CT code 429125006 (History of lymphadenopathy) because it conveys past temporal context and the associated finding without adding site, cause, or other attributes. Parent concepts that represent generic history are less precise, and child or sibling concepts specifying location or family context are not supported by the wording."
284767002,Dry ski slope (environment),Non-snow ski slope,"By stating 'non-snow ski slope,' the entry precisely conveys the dry ski slope environment. No time, cause, or severity attributes are included. Category: Environment or geographical location. A parent concept would not include the non-snow qualifier, and other siblings (e.g., snow ski slope) are explicitly excluded. The synonym is clinically equivalent, ensuring SCTID 284767002 is the most precise match."
285717004,High temperature (physical force),High temperature specified (physical force),"The entry explicitly specifies high temperature and anchors it to the physical force domain. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and the best match is SCTID 285717004. It avoids environmental or exposure framing and does not imply a clinical condition in the patient. Parent concepts would be too generic, while siblings like low temperature or other forces are not indicated by the text."
285333004,White light (physical force),Operative illumination: white light,"It documents that operative illumination is white light, naming the physical agent without adding device or quantitative attributes. Category: Physical force. This aligns with White light (physical force), SCTID 285333004, not broader visible light or other wavelength-specific siblings. The operative context is incidental and does not change the identity of the agent; thus the most precise code remains 285333004."
58876003,Platinum-186 (substance),Material: Pt-186,"This entry labels the material as Pt-186, indicating the specific isotope of platinum with mass number 186. No other attributes such as mixture, salt, or intended application are stated. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Substance category, specifically Platinum-186 (substance), SCTID 58876003. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling isotopes do not match the mass number given. The use of chemical symbol is a safe synonym that maintains exact substance identity."
1209082007,Estimated quantity of intake of thickener additive in 24 hours (observable entity),Caregiver-reported estimated amount of thickener additive intake in the previous 24 hours,"The entry conveys a caregiver-reported estimate of the amount of thickener additive intake in the prior 24 hours, preserving estimation, intake, substance, and timeframe. Category: Observable entity. Source of report does not alter coding. Parent observables without substance detail and siblings with measured values or different time periods are less accurate matches."
153211000146100,Healthcare professional forgot to administer medication (finding),Documentation: medication administration was forgotten by healthcare professional,"The documentation specifies that the medication administration was forgotten by a healthcare professional, which directly matches the Clinical finding 153211000146100. This is more specific than a parent concept because the cause is forgetfulness and the agent is staff. The wording avoids adding timing, drug identity, or severity, retaining unique codability to this concept."
463873008,Pneumatic craniotomy system (physical object),Air-powered craniotomy system,"The main concept is a craniotomy system whose power source is air, i.e., pneumatic; this is a device designation. Category is Physical object. 'Air-powered' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'pneumatic' and does not change the concept beyond the specified power modality. This maps to SNOMED CT 463873008. Parent concepts that lack power modality are less specific, while siblings such as electric or battery-powered craniotomy systems are incorrect. Component-only devices (e.g., craniotome alone) would be too specific and not a system."
113173007,Domiciliary (environment),Patient’s home environment,"This specifies the home environment as it pertains to the patient, without adding clinical conditions or services. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 113173007 (Domiciliary [environment]) is the correct code because the environment described remains domiciliary in nature; adding “patient’s” does not change the environmental concept. A parent environment concept would be overly broad, while siblings like hospital or nursing home environments would be incorrect. There is no implication of home care or a home visit procedure. The wording maintains equivalence to domiciliary environment for coding purposes."
18029009,Kalanchoe delagoensis (organism),Botany report lists Kalanchoe delagoensis,"A report listing Kalanchoe delagoensis names the organism itself without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 18029009 is the exact species code. More general taxa such as Kalanchoe genus or other species (e.g., Kalanchoe pinnata) are not appropriate because the entry specifies this species."
744847008,Skeletal muscle structure of left lower limb (body structure),Skeletal muscle structure of left lower limb,"The main concept stated is the anatomical entity comprising all skeletal muscle structures in the patient's left lower limb. This is a Body structure in SNOMED CT. The wording exactly matches the preferred term for SCTID 744847008, making it the most precise code. Broader parent concepts such as “Skeletal muscle structure of lower limb” lack laterality, and narrower child or sibling concepts (e.g., specific compartments like left thigh or right lower limb) would not fit the whole-limb, left-sided scope. No additional attributes (pathology, severity, timing) are introduced."
14143006,Choanotaenia infundibulum (organism),Report header: Choanotaenia infundibulum,"This entry presents the species Choanotaenia infundibulum in a report header context, but it conveys only the organism name. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 14143006 captures this species precisely. There are no attributes such as detection, disease, host, site, or stage. Mapping to parent genus or broader classes would be less specific; mapping to sibling species would be incorrect."
309901009,Anesthetic department (environment),Dept of anesthesia,"The phrase 'Dept of anesthesia' directly refers to the anesthesia/anesthetics department environment. It avoids adding procedural or encounter details. In SNOMED CT, this should be coded as the Environment concept 309901009. Organizational service concepts or different environments (e.g., Operating theatre) would not match the wording. 'Anesthesia' is a clinically equivalent term to 'anesthetic' in naming the department."
167198009,Digestive function test normal (finding),Digestive function test normal,"The entry explicitly states a normal result of a digestive function test, which corresponds directly to the concept 'Digestive function test normal (finding)' SCTID 167198009. The main medical concept is a test result concerning digestive system function, with the attribute 'normal' clearly indicated. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, as it represents an observed outcome of testing rather than the procedure itself. This is more precise than broader parents like 'Test result normal' and does not name any specific child test (e.g., D-xylose), nor does it suggest abnormality or a different system, making the given code the exact match."
257676000,Public house (environment),At a pub,"This indicates the environment as a pub, a clinically safe synonym for public house, without adding additional attributes. The concept is in the Environment or geographical location hierarchy and maps to Public house (environment) [257676000]. Parents that are generic locations or siblings like restaurant/nightclub would be less accurate."
213773001,"Collision between railway vehicles, railway employee injured (event)",Collision involving railway rolling stock; railway employee injured,"“Rolling stock” is a standard synonym for railway vehicles, and the entry explicitly states injury to a railway employee, mapping to 213773001. The main concept is a collision between railway vehicles (rolling stock) with an injured railway employee. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This is more precise than general rail accidents and avoids sibling concepts with different injured parties. The synonym does not introduce new attributes and is semantically consistent with the preferred term."
85702000,Genus Amphimerus (organism),Genus Amphimerus,"This phrase states the organism at genus rank: Amphimerus. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy and corresponds directly to SCTID 85702000. Broader parent taxa (e.g., trematodes in general) do not capture the precise genus, and sibling genera are incorrect. No additional attributes like presence, disease, or life-cycle stage are implied, ensuring the genus-level organism concept is the appropriate code."
80032004,Fire (physical force),Fire specified on form,"The form specifies ‘fire’ only, with no additional qualifiers. Main concept: fire; SNOMED CT category: Physical force. The correct code is Fire (physical force) 80032004. Broader physical force or event/exposure/injury codes are inappropriate because the entry does not include those attributes. The phrase indicates documentation context, not a different clinical entity."
736400009,Cardiology inpatient care plan (record artifact),Hospital cardiology care plan (inpatient),"This entry indicates a hospital-based (inpatient) care plan specific to cardiology, clearly pointing to a documented plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The parent concept Care plan lacks the cardiology and inpatient qualifiers, and siblings such as outpatient plans or treatment-only plans are not appropriate given the explicit inpatient context. The addition of '(inpatient)' preserves the intended setting without introducing timing, severity, or disease attributes, so Cardiology inpatient care plan (736400009) is the precise match."
86213006,Long-billed marsh wren (organism),Record: long-billed marsh wren,"This denotes the organism Long-billed marsh wren within a record context; the context does not alter the underlying taxon. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 86213006 is the exact match. More general parent concepts or other wren species are not indicated here, so this entry maps unambiguously to the specified concept."
702171001,"Femoral artery compression plug, collagen (physical object)",Femoral artery compression plug made of collagen,"The entry emphasizes material (collagen) and identifies the device type (compression plug) for the femoral artery, maintaining the required elements. This is a Physical object. SCTID 702171001 precisely corresponds to a femoral artery compression plug composed of collagen. Generic compression plugs or devices for other arteries are not as specific (parent/sibling), and different closure mechanisms would be inappropriate. The synonymic phrasing is equivalent and preserves codability to the exact concept."
1293022002,Entire soft tissue of chest wall (body structure),Anatomic site: entire chest wall soft tissues,"The phrase indicates an anatomical site, with 'entire chest wall soft tissues' providing the precise target structure and scope. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. Despite the documentation context ('Anatomic site'), the core concept is the body structure matching 'Entire soft tissue of chest wall.' Parent concepts that include osseous elements or siblings lacking the totality qualifier are less suitable. No clinical findings or procedures are implied."
70059001,Blood group antigen At^a^ (substance),Counseling note: reviewed At(a) blood group antigen,"The narrative indicates discussion of the At(a) blood group antigen, which still refers solely to the antigen substance. There is no assertion of the patient’s antigen status, testing, or antibodies. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the correct concept being Blood group antigen At^a^ (SCTID: 70059001). Selecting the parent Blood group antigen would lose specificity, and siblings would be other antigen names. The counseling context does not modify the underlying concept."
224873004,Training center (environment),Patient reports being at a training center,"A patient-reported statement that solely identifies the environment as a training center, without adding cause, timing, or activity. This is an Environment concept and maps accurately to Training center (environment), SCTID 224873004. Parents like generic facility or location are less specific, and siblings or children such as gym, school, or military training facility would be overly specific and not stated. The phrasing is semantically equivalent in representing the same environment."
33679000,Vibration (physical force),Vibratory force present,"This phrasing states the presence of the vibratory force without adding attributes like origin, frequency, extent, or impact. The main concept is vibration. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. It maps most precisely to 33679000 Vibration (physical force). The words “force present” provide only context of detection, not exposure or injury. Parent Physical force is overly broad, and sibling forces (Pressure, Shock) do not capture sustained oscillation."
40087002,"Threshold perception, function (observable entity)",Perception threshold functional parameter,"Describing the perception threshold as a functional parameter frames it as an observable variable, which aligns with Threshold perception, function (Observable entity; SCTID 40087002). No modality, value, or state (normal/abnormal) is included, so it does not drift to a clinical finding or to a child concept like auditory or pain threshold. The term 'parameter' is a standard synonym for an observable and does not change the code selection."
468884003,Epidural space locator (physical object),Epidural space detection device,"The entry describes a device for detecting the epidural space, which is functionally equivalent to locating/identifying it and is a Physical object (device). The optimal SNOMED CT match is Epidural space locator (physical object), SCTID 468884003. It avoids specifying technology (pressure, electronic), so child concepts are not implicated, and it is more specific than a generic detector device (parent). Sibling devices like catheters or needles are excluded by the explicit detection function."
429063000,Lives in bungalow (finding),Pre-op assessment: bungalow residence,"Although contextualized in a preoperative assessment, the content purely states the residence is a bungalow. This remains a Clinical finding and matches 429063000 Lives in bungalow (finding). The setting does not alter the concept; broader or different dwelling types are not indicated, and no subtype detail is given that would require a more specific code."
470348000,Hip unit prosthesis (physical object),Implant sticker reads “hip unit prosthesis”,"The implant identification sticker naming hip unit prosthesis indicates the specific device, aligning with the Physical object Hip unit prosthesis (SCTID 470348000). The context is labeling/identification rather than clinical finding or procedure, and it introduces no attributes such as laterality, fixation, material, total vs hemi, or component-level components. As such, child or sibling device concepts are not better fits, and broader parent categories are less precise than the unit-level term. The synonymic phrasing does not alter code selection. Hip unit prosthesis is the correct mapping."
108828006,Product containing alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist (product),Clinical documentation: alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist medication,"This denotes a documented medication product characterized by an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist active ingredient class, aligning with the Product hierarchy. It matches SNOMED CT 108828006. The absence of specific drug names, formulations, or routes means it should not be coded to a more specific child concept. Parent classes that don’t specify the alpha-2 receptor subtype are too general. The wording is a clinically safe synonym for the preferred term and maintains equivalent semantics without additional attributes."
699034004,Home oxygen therapy declined (situation),Refusal of home oxygen therapy recorded.,"The phrase indicates that a refusal of home oxygen therapy has been recorded, maintaining the concept of declined home-based oxygen intervention. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. Home oxygen therapy declined (699034004) is the exact match. Parent concepts like general refusal or oxygen therapy declined lack the home specificity, while home oxygen therapy as a procedure would inaccurately suggest delivery. The wording does not add cause, timing, or severity attributes."
223743006,Irian Jaya (geographic location),Born in Irian Jaya,"Although presented as birth context, the named entity is the geographical location Irian Jaya. SNOMED CT places this under Location (Geographic location), and the precise match is Irian Jaya (geographic location) [223743006]. The phrasing does not imply any other location or a broader/sibling concept; it directly names Irian Jaya and therefore should be coded to that specific place."
51272001,Osmotic pressure (observable entity),Physicochemical observable: osmotic pressure,"The wording classifies osmotic pressure as a physicochemical observable, which accurately describes its nature as a measurable property. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This aligns with 51272001 because it does not introduce specimen, value, or interpretive qualifiers. Parent classes of physicochemical observables would be too broad, and siblings like osmolality or osmolarity have different definitions, making them less appropriate. The term remains semantically focused on the osmotic pressure property."
246692008,Eye movement with both eyes open (observable entity),Binocular eye movement,"This uses the synonym “binocular” to indicate both eyes are open and engaged, which is clinically equivalent to “with both eyes open.” The concept is an Observable entity and aligns with SCTID 246692008. Choosing parent “Eye movement” would be too general, lacking the binocular condition. Child or sibling findings like “Abnormal binocular eye movements” would add abnormality not specified. The phrasing avoids procedural or result attributes, maintaining a pure observable."
473399006,Swab from Tenckhoff catheter exit site (specimen),Tenckhoff PD catheter exit-site swab,"The entry denotes a swab collected from the exit site of a Tenckhoff peritoneal dialysis catheter. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 473399006 precisely matches this source and specimen type. Parent concepts are too general, lacking the Tenckhoff exit-site specificity, and sibling concepts referencing non-Tenckhoff catheters or different specimen types (e.g., catheter tip) would miscode the source. Including 'PD catheter' clarifies device context without adding extra clinical attributes."
1365661001,Surgical margin involved by primary malignant neoplasm of distal hepatic bile duct in excised tissue specimen (observable entity),Margin status: involved by primary malignant neoplasm of distal hepatic bile duct on excision.,"The entry presents margin status as 'involved' specifically by a primary malignant neoplasm of the distal hepatic bile duct, with the context of excision. It is an Observable entity related to margin assessment. SCTID 1365661001 fits as it demands involved margin, the primary nature of the neoplasm, the distal hepatic bile duct site, and excised tissue. A parent concept lacking these details would be too general, and siblings like margin uninvolved or different anatomical sites would not align. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase and preserves the same meaning."
16535321000119101,History of optic atrophy (situation),Medical history includes optic atrophy,"This entry places optic atrophy within the patient's medical history section, explicitly conveying a historical situation. It matches the Situation with explicit context concept History of optic atrophy (SCTID: 16535321000119101). It does not introduce laterality, cause, or other qualifiers. Parent disorder coding is less precise because it lacks the history context; sibling concepts with family context are not indicated."
773963002,Product containing nerve growth factor agonist (product),Pharmacy record entry: NGF agonist drug product,"In pharmacy record context, this indicates a drug product classified as an NGF agonist, with no additional attributes like dosage form, route, strength, brand, or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). It best matches SCTID 773963002 because it clearly refers to a product containing an NGF agonist. Substance-only concepts are avoided by the explicit “drug product” wording. Child concepts (specific ingredient/formulation) are not implied, and broader parent or antagonist sibling concepts are inconsistent with the specified NGF agonist mechanism."
736337002,Neurosurgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Neurosurgical inpatient care plan,"Using the adjective “neurosurgical” is a synonymous way to indicate the neurosurgery specialty. The entry conveys a plan-of-care document for inpatient management by neurosurgery, which is a Record artifact. This maps exactly to “Neurosurgery inpatient care plan (record artifact)” rather than broader or different concepts. Operative plans, discharge plans, or outpatient care plans are excluded by the inpatient qualifier, ensuring this code is the best fit."
120838009,Antibody to Paragonimus (substance),Reference note uses the term 'Paragonimus antibody'.,"The content identifies the antibody substance targeting Paragonimus, without introducing a test, result, class, or species details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches antibody to paragonimus (SCTID 120838009). More general antibody concepts would be imprecise, and species-specific antibodies or serologic findings would introduce attributes not present. The synonymal phrasing is clinically equivalent."
421662006,Texas (geographic location),Location specified: Texas,"Texas is provided as the specified location. The SNOMED CT category is Location/Geographic location. The entry maps to 421662006 because the only substantive content is the named geographic place. It does not imply residence, origin, or travel, and thus avoids mapping to other constructs involving relationships or events."
224851006,Junior school (environment),Junior school site,"This denotes the site (i.e., environment) being a junior school, mapping to Junior school (environment), SCTID 224851006 within the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. It avoids introducing structure-specific notions like 'building' or 'campus' that could shift to physical-object concepts. Broader School (environment) would be less specific, and other school levels are siblings not indicated by the wording. 'Site' serves as a clinical synonym for environment/setting, preserving the code."
49211008,Equid herpesvirus 3 (organism),Virus: Equine herpesvirus 3,"This context label explicitly names the organism as a virus and then specifies Equine herpesvirus 3. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It matches Equid herpesvirus 3 (SCTID 49211008) and does not introduce any additional attributes such as testing outcomes or infection. Parent organism groups would be less precise, and sibling types would be different viruses. The 'Virus:' prefix clarifies category but does not alter the concept being coded."
1285326006,Number of metastatic neoplasms in excised tissue specimen (observable entity),Documented number of metastatic neoplasms in surgically excised tissue,"This statement indicates a documented count of metastatic neoplasms within tissue removed surgically, avoiding any numeric value or anatomical site details. The concept is an Observable entity, as it refers to a quantitative data element in a pathology report. The wording maps precisely to SCTID 1285326006 because it preserves both the metastatic property and the excised tissue context. Parent observables lacking metastatic specificity or sibling observables for other specimen types would not be as accurate."
1332320008,Interviewer led Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire fatigue subscale score (observable entity),Interviewer-conducted Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire fatigue score,"The entry references the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire and the fatigue score and specifies that it was interviewer-conducted, indicating the mode. Although it says ‘fatigue score’ without the word ‘subscale,’ within the CRQ context, fatigue is a defined subscale/domain; no other attributes are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this is an Observable entity, representing an instrument-derived score. The mention of interviewer-conducted and the CRQ fatigue score makes SCTID 1332320008 the precise match, not the self-administered fatigue score or other CRQ subscales. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that preserves the exact concept."
701133007,Flexible fiberoptic cystourethroscope (physical object),Flexible fiberoptic cystourethroscope introduced,"The action verb 'introduced' pertains to use but the device remains explicitly a flexible fiberoptic cystourethroscope. The concept is a Physical object and aligns with SNOMED CT 701133007. Broader parent concepts or different scope modalities (rigid, video) are not justified by the wording. The procedural context does not alter the device attributes, so the specific code is most accurate."
284745003,Clothes shop (environment),Scene: clothing store,"‘Scene: clothing store’ denotes the environmental scene as a clothing retail setting, mapping to 'Clothes shop (environment)' SCTID 284745003. Category: Environment or geographical location. The word 'Scene:' serves only as a documentation marker and does not add clinical attributes. A parent like 'Retail shop' would be less specific, and narrower siblings (e.g., 'thrift store') introduce additional business-type constraints. Therefore, the clothes shop concept is the correct selection."
119336008,Exhaled air specimen (specimen),Exhalation air specimen,The phrase 'exhalation air' is a paraphrase of exhaled air and denotes the same specimen type. No additional attributes are present. The category is Specimen. This is clinically equivalent to exhaled air and does not imply condensate or alveolar sampling; hence Exhaled air specimen is the precise code rather than parent or child concepts.
77629005,Structure of submucous part of myometrium (body structure),Submucosal part of myometrium,"This phrasing uses the clinically equivalent synonym “submucosal” for “submucous,” both denoting the layer just beneath the mucosa. The concept is strictly anatomical and falls under Body structure. It aligns exactly with SCTID 77629005. Using broader parent concepts (e.g., myometrium generally) would be less precise, and sibling layers (e.g., subserosal) would be incorrect. The synonym does not add or change attributes; it maintains the same anatomical scope."
411715007,Lupinus albus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Label: Lupinus albus diagnostic allergen extract,The entry indicates a label text while precisely naming the product: a diagnostic allergen extract of Lupinus albus. Category: Product. This maps to SNOMED CT 411715007 because the species and diagnostic purpose are explicit. The context of labeling does not shift the concept to a procedure or a different product class. No extra attributes are included that would change code selection.
242046006,Sexual abuse of disabled person (event),Problem list entry: sexual abuse of disabled person,"This denotes the event of sexual abuse in a disabled person as a problem list item, which is a documentation context. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242046006 is exact because it encodes sexual abuse with the victim identified as disabled. Parent concepts are too broad without the disability qualifier, while sibling or child concepts (e.g., assault, rape, non-sexual abuse) do not match the wording. Contextual placement does not introduce additional attributes."
438716008,Streptomyces fumanus (organism),Lab organism: Streptomyces fumanus,"This names the organism Streptomyces fumanus in a laboratory context, without asserting detection status, infection, or site. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 438716008 is the exact species code. Using a parent taxon would reduce specificity, and choosing a finding/disorder concept would add attributes not conveyed. Sibling species are not compatible with the stated name."
707735001,Cytolytic protein (substance),Protein exhibiting cytolysis,"This entry describes a protein with the property of causing cytolysis, which is clinically equivalent to cytolytic protein, mapping to SNOMED CT 707735001. The main concept is the substance class of proteins with cytolytic activity; it does not add details like use, detection, or origin. Category: Substance. It is more specific than the parent Protein concept and avoids child concepts by not naming a particular protein. The paraphrase conveys the same semantics and preserves the precise code."
17468009,Structure of ceratopharyngeal part of middle constrictor pharyngeus muscle (body structure),Dissection label: ceratopharyngeal part of middle constrictor pharyngeus,"This denotes an anatomical labeling context and the specific part: the ceratopharyngeal part of the middle constrictor pharyngeus muscle. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It is the precise match to 17468009, not the broader middle constrictor muscle or another part. The choice of wording does not introduce any new attributes; it remains strictly an anatomical structure."
1136681000004107,Anatomic location of excised primary malignant neoplasm (observable entity),Follow-up note — anatomic location of the excised primary cancer,"In follow-up context, this still denotes the same observable: the anatomical location of a primary cancer that has been excised. This is an Observable entity rather than a disorder. It matches SCTID 1136681000004107 due to precise inclusion of primary malignancy, excision, and anatomic site. Parent observables lacking these constraints or siblings centered on metastasis or procedure sites would diverge. No extra clinical attributes (e.g., recurrence status, laterality) are conveyed."
772034009,Product containing hydrolase (product),Hydrolase enzyme-containing product,"This entry states the product contains a hydrolase enzyme, without narrowing to a particular enzyme subtype or adding attributes such as dose or route. Main concept: product containing hydrolase. Category: Product. It fits “Product containing hydrolase” rather than broader parents (any enzyme) or sibling classes (e.g., oxidoreductases). It avoids child concepts tied to specific hydrolases. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and does not alter code choice."
364204002,Genital observable (observable entity),Observable entity: genital,"The wording directly identifies an observable entity with a genital focus, without including findings or procedural actions. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 364204002 is the precise match because it captures the genital domain of the observable; the colon usage simply clarifies scope. Mapping to the parent Observable entity would ignore the genital qualifier, and mapping to any child/sibling with detailed attributes (e.g., external genital appearance observable) would over-specify. The phrasing remains neutral and does not introduce added attributes."
233582002,Intermittent hemofiltration (procedure),RRT delivered: intermittent hemofiltration,"The entry states that renal replacement therapy was delivered via intermittent hemofiltration, without other modality details. Category is Procedure; the precise SNOMED mapping is Intermittent hemofiltration (procedure). A parent hemofiltration concept loses the intermittent characteristic, and siblings such as continuous hemofiltration or hemodialysis are excluded. Mentioning RRT is contextual and does not introduce a different procedure."
434811003,Haliangium tepidum (organism),Named microorganism: Haliangium tepidum,"The phrase identifies a microorganism by name, Haliangium tepidum, which is accurate for a species of bacterium. The central concept is the species-level organism; in SNOMED CT, this is an Organism concept with code SCTID 434811003. The descriptor “microorganism” is a safe synonym and does not add attributes. More general parent concepts or other species would not be as precise as the exact species code."
405068005,Self-control behavior: self-mutilation (observable entity),Self-mutilation—self-control behavior (observable),"This phrasing presents the same assessment item as an observable labeled in the self-control behavior domain, focusing on self-mutilation. No additional attributes are introduced; it remains an item label. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The code 405068005 precisely corresponds to this observable and is preferred over clinical finding concepts like 'Self-mutilation (finding),' which would imply a condition rather than the name of an assessment item. Parent or sibling observables not specific to self-mutilation would be less accurate."
371540001,Supervising physician report (record artifact),Supervising MD report,"Here “MD” is a common synonym for physician in clinical documentation, and “supervising MD” denotes the supervising physician role. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This maps to the same report type and is more specific than general physician or clinical reports. No content, status, or domain attributes are introduced, so child or sibling concepts are not more appropriate."
770614002,Norris Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Scale score (observable entity),Observable: Norris Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Scale score,"Explicitly marking it as an 'observable' underscores that the concept is the measurement variable—the Norris ALS Scale score. SNOMED CT 770614002 corresponds exactly. It does not imply different instruments or subcomponents and does not add attributes like severity or timing, thereby excluding parent generic scores and sibling ALS-specific scales."
89518002,N-octylbicycloheptene dicarboximide (substance),"Octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide, N-","This indexing-style variant of the chemical name refers to the same compound, N-octylbicycloheptene dicarboximide. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. No additional attributes (use, exposure, reaction) are present, so SCTID 89518002 is correct. Broader parents or other imide derivatives as siblings would not be as specific to this exact chemical."
411719001,Malus sylvestris diagnostic allergen extract (product),Malus sylvestris diagnostic allergen test extract,"The entry specifies a test extract for diagnostic allergy evaluation sourced from Malus sylvestris. This corresponds to the Product concept of a diagnostic allergen extract for that species. More generic parent products and non-diagnostic or different-species siblings are not as precise. The phrase 'test extract' is a synonymic paraphrase of diagnostic extract and retains the same meaning, supporting SCTID 411719001."
1055246005,All entire distal phalanges of hand (body structure),All distal phalanges of hand—entire structures,"The phrase specifies the distal phalanges of the hand and explicitly qualifies them as entire structures, collectively encompassing all digits of a hand. No extraneous attributes are present. SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 1055246005 is exact for this all-inclusive, ‘entire’ distal phalanx grouping. A concept omitting ‘entire’ would be less precise; any single-digit distal phalanx concept would be too narrow; and structures like proximal/middle phalanges are incorrect anatomical siblings."
223934008,Dumfries and Galloway (geographic location),Postal region recorded as Dumfries and Galloway.,"The content identifies the postal region using the geographic area Dumfries and Galloway, which is a place name. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The reference matches the region exactly, avoiding broader or narrower geographies and organizational references. SCTID 223934008 is the most accurate mapping."
54595007,Eretmapodites (organism),Record lists: Eretmapodites genus,"The wording indicates a record that lists the Eretmapodites genus, retaining the focus on the organismal taxon. Category: Organism. It maps to SCTID 54595007 because the genus is explicitly named without specifying species or adding exposure/disease attributes. Parent or sibling taxa would be less precise, and any child species would be overly specific. The record-listing context does not alter the organism concept being coded."
182034009,Entire iliac crest (body structure),Iliac crest ridge,"The entry describes the iliac crest as a ridge, which is an accurate anatomical characterization of the same complete crest. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 182034009 is suitable as it represents the entire crest; choosing 'Ilium' or other pelvic features would be too general or incorrect. The term 'ridge' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase not adding new attributes."
29425004,Ohisaurus (organism),Ohisaurus listed as organism,"Stating that Ohisaurus is listed as an organism still conveys only the organism identity, without clinical events or attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This corresponds to SCTID 29425004, avoiding implications of detection or conditions. Parent categories would be too broad, and no alternative taxa are mentioned. The listing context is documentation semantics and does not change the coded concept."
315183007,Psittacosis antibody level (procedure),Quantitation of antibodies to Chlamydia psittaci,"This entry conveys a quantitative procedure measuring antibodies against Chlamydia psittaci. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, mapping precisely to 315183007 Psittacosis antibody level (procedure). The phrasing focuses on quantitation and the specific organism, avoiding broader parents (e.g., general antibody measurement) and siblings that imply qualitative screening. It does not introduce isotype, specimen, timing, or result, preserving exact alignment with the concept."
105539002,Non-smoker for personal reasons (finding),Not a smoker because of personal reasons,"Here the non-smoking status is explicitly tied to personal reasons, matching the intended concept. This belongs to Clinical findings. The explicit reason attribute makes it more precise than a generic non-smoker code. There is no implication of prior smoking or a medically driven cessation, so 'Ex-smoker', 'Never smoked tobacco', or 'Non-smoker for medical reasons' are less appropriate. The phrasing is a safe synonym that preserves the original concept."
214518009,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving breakage of any part of motor vehicle while in motion, motor cyclist injured (event)","EMS report: Motorcyclist injured, no collision; mechanical breakage of vehicle part while traveling on roadway.","EMS documentation confirms noncollision ('no collision'), traffic context ('on roadway'), in-motion part breakage ('while traveling'), and the injured motorcyclist. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Sibling concepts like collision events or falls are excluded by explicit wording. 'Mechanical breakage' and 'vehicle part' are equivalent expressions of the concept's breakage attribute without adding new details."
42949004,Enterolobium cyclocarpum (organism),Reference organism: Enterolobium cyclocarpum,"The phrase denotes that Enterolobium cyclocarpum is the organism of reference, with no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This maps to 42949004 because it names the species directly. Selecting a parent or sibling concept would be inaccurate, and there is no mention of parts or clinical conditions that would shift coding away from the organism concept."
703797007,Ponatinib hydrochloride (substance),Med reconciliation entry recorded as ponatinib hydrochloride (name only),"The context indicates a name-only entry, and the substance specified is ponatinib hydrochloride. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This is best coded as Ponatinib hydrochloride (substance), SCTID 703797007, because the hydrochloride salt is identified and no product attributes are present. Using ponatinib (substance) would be less precise."
391169006,Plasma perhexiline level (procedure),Plasma perhexiline level checked,"This statement indicates that the perhexiline level in plasma was checked (i.e., measured), which constitutes a performed laboratory procedure. Category: Procedure. Plasma perhexiline level (391169006) is the precise match because the analyte and plasma specimen are explicit. Concepts for requests or plans would be inappropriate since the phrasing implies completion, and siblings for serum/blood levels do not fit the plasma reference. “Checked” is a common clinical synonym meaning measured and does not alter the procedural code."
284546000,Hospice (environment),Imaging study performed in a hospice setting,"The statement specifies the physical setting for the imaging study as a hospice, focusing on environment rather than the procedure itself. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the most precise concept is Hospice (environment), SCTID 284546000. There is no mention of hospice care services, referral, admission, or discharge; the emphasis is solely on the location. Broader environmental parents would be less specific, and care-regimen siblings would be incorrect. The synonym “setting” aligns with environmental context and does not introduce additional attributes beyond location."
1352564007,Union for International Cancer Control pT2a (qualifier value),Path stage: UICC pT2a,"This entry indicates a pathologic stage designation of UICC pT2a and thus points to the UICC pT2a qualifier value. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 1352564007 is the appropriate code. It does not introduce organ site, grade, or timing, staying within the generic UICC pT2a semantics. Using a parent like UICC pT2 would be less precise, and clinical T categories would be incorrect. The phrasing is a safe synonym emphasizing the pathologic nature."
699484004,Lateral tongue thrust (finding),Sideward tongue thrust,"“Sideward” is a plain-language synonym for lateral, conveying a tongue thrust directed toward the side, with no other attributes implied. This represents a Clinical finding and is most precisely coded as Lateral tongue thrust (699484004). A generic tongue thrust code would overlook the directional detail, and siblings with anterior or posterior directionality would not fit the wording. The paraphrase is equivalent to the preferred term and does not change code selection."
284887008,Ability to shave (observable entity),ADL: ability to shave,"This explicitly places shaving ability within Activities of Daily Living while retaining the neutral construct of 'ability.' The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 284887008 is the exact match due to its specificity to shaving ability. It does not represent an assessment procedure or a positive/negative finding; nor does it broaden to grooming generally. The wording avoids added attributes like assistance level or timing."
15227002,"Gastric secretory inhibition, function (observable entity)",Report notes gastric secretory inhibition function,"In a report context, the entry refers to the observable function of gastric secretory inhibition without stating any result. It remains an Observable entity and matches SCTID 15227002. A procedure code would be wrong because no testing action is named, and a finding code would be inappropriate without abnormality. The inhibitory focus excludes broader parents and non-inhibitory siblings."
75518000,Kobus leche (organism),Kobus leche species,"The entry explicitly denotes the species as Kobus leche, maintaining species specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and it maps to “Kobus leche (organism)” SCTID 75518000. By naming the species, it avoids coding at a broader parent level or to related sibling species. It does not specify subspecies or other qualifiers. No additional attributes are presented in the wording."
763492008,Optical-guidance prostate biopsy system handpiece and needle (physical object),Optically guided prostate biopsy system handpiece and needle,"Main concept: the handpiece and needle component of a prostate biopsy system that uses optical guidance. Category: Physical object (Device). The synonym “optically guided” is clinically equivalent to “optical-guidance,” preserving the guidance modality, target application (prostate biopsy), and the specific combined components (handpiece and needle). This aligns directly with SCTID 763492008. Parent concepts lacking component detail or guidance modality, and siblings like ultrasound-guided devices or needle-only items, are less appropriate given the wording."
437915004,Streptococcus infantarius subspecies coli (organism),Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli,"This entry uses the standard abbreviation 'subsp.' for subspecies and names Streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli. The main concept is the organism taxonomy; no additional attributes are given. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 437915004 is the most precise code because it exactly represents this subspecies. Broader parent taxa (e.g., Streptococcus infantarius or Streptococcus spp.) are not as specific, and other subspecies within the SBSEC would be incorrect. The abbreviation 'subsp.' is a clinically accepted synonym for 'subspecies' and does not alter the code selection."
103579009,Race (observable entity),Race data element,"The phrase frames race as a structured data element in the record, which is exactly the intent of 'Race (observable entity)' [103579009]. No race value is provided, so child qualifier values are not applicable. It remains separate from sibling observables like ethnicity and avoids conflating with social constructs beyond the observable attribute."
184235000,Repeat prescription card (record artifact),Repeat prescription card kept with records,"This entry denotes a repeat prescription card and mentions it is kept with records; storage context does not change the artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The most precise code is 184235000 Repeat prescription card (record artifact), as the emphasis is on the card artifact for repeat prescribing. The parent Record artifact would be less specific, and siblings like form-based or electronic artifacts are different media. The storage detail does not introduce new attributes beyond the artifact itself."
216393003,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, cafe (environment)",Patient states the accident/poisoning occurred at a cafe (place of occurrence).,"This patient-reported entry identifies the cafe as the place-of-occurrence for an accident or poisoning, limiting content to environment/location. It does not introduce event details beyond the allowed accident/poisoning context. In SNOMED CT, this maps to the Environment or geographical location category, specifically concept 216393003. A more general parent omits the venue specificity, and siblings like restaurant or bar do not match the term cafe. The phrasing aligns with the concept and does not change attributes relevant to coding."
44026004,Occella impi (organism),Occella impi,"The entry names the specific organism Occella impi and contains no additional clinical attributes (no site, severity, timing, or causality). The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most precise match is Occella impi (organism), SCTID 44026004, which represents this exact species-level taxon. Broader parent concepts such as Occella (genus), Fish (organism), or Animal (organism) would be less specific. No sibling or child concept better fits, as the wording is strictly the binomial species name without qualifiers. Since the text is the canonical scientific name, no synonym mapping is required and the code selection remains unambiguous."
213818005,"Train collision with platform, passenger injured (event)",Triage: passenger injured in train-platform impact,"‘Impact’ serves as a synonym for collision in trauma documentation, and the passenger injury is specified, fitting the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This entry remains more specific than generic rail accident parents and does not drift to siblings without injury detail. The context label ‘Triage’ does not add attributes to the event itself."
430389009,Cytologic material obtained from amniotic fluid (specimen),Pathology specimen—amniotic fluid cytologic material,"The wording identifies a pathology specimen consisting of cytologic material from amniotic fluid, clearly describing a cell-based amniotic fluid specimen. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. SCTID 430389009 is the precise match because it denotes cytologic material obtained from amniotic fluid. Broad parents like 'Amniotic fluid specimen' or non-source-specific 'Cytologic material' are less specific, and other-fluid cytologic specimens are siblings. 'Pathology specimen' is contextual and does not change the specimen identity."
411412009,Color developing chemical (product),Product label: color developing chemical,"This entry references the product label text, but the core concept named is a color developing chemical; the labeling context does not introduce clinical attributes or specificity. SNOMED CT category: Product. The precise code is Color developing chemical (product). More general product categories would be under-specified, while sibling products describing different processing roles (e.g., fixer) would be inaccurate. The wording remains a clinically equivalent expression, preserving the code selection."
433960002,Abuse by sibling (event),Abuse perpetrated by sibling.,"The entry states abuse and identifies the perpetrator as a sibling, with no extra descriptors. Main concept: abuse; explicit attribute: perpetrator is sibling. Category: Event. SCTID 433960002 is the most precise match because it encodes the event of abuse by a sibling. A parent concept would be too general, and more specific children (e.g., physical/sexual) are not justified by the wording. The paraphrase “perpetrated by sibling” is equivalent to “by sibling,” and does not add any additional attributes that would change the code."
368786008,Entire anterior aspect of eyelids (body structure),"Eyelids, entire anterior aspect","This is a concise anatomical labeling where 'eyelids' are the structure and 'entire anterior aspect' is the specified surface. Category: Body structure. It matches SCTID 368786008 because it is neither broader (e.g., eyelid overall) nor narrower (e.g., upper/lower, margin). Sibling concepts like the posterior aspect do not apply due to 'anterior'. The punctuation and order do not add attributes, preserving exact site semantics."
411644001,Brassica rapa diagnostic allergen extract (product),Brassica rapa diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry explicitly names the diagnostic allergen extract for Brassica rapa and does not add any other attributes. The main concept is a specific allergen extract product used for diagnostic testing, which places it in the SNOMED CT category Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). This precisely matches SCTID 411644001 because it specifies the species (Brassica rapa) and its diagnostic use as an allergen extract. Broader parent concepts like generic diagnostic allergen extract or Brassica allergen extract would be less precise, and sibling or child concepts such as therapeutic (immunotherapy) extracts or skin-prick-specific reagents are not indicated by the wording."
370367002,Exercise tolerance test equivocal (finding),Treadmill test equivocal,"The entry specifies a treadmill test, which is commonly synonymous with an exercise tolerance test, and indicates the outcome is equivocal. This is a Clinical finding that maps to SNOMED CT 370367002. It avoids extra attributes and focuses on the test/result pairing. Parent categories are too broad, and siblings for other modalities or alternate result states would be incorrect. “Treadmill test” is a clinically accepted synonym for ETT and does not change the code selection."
1279968000,Neonatology department (environment),Encounter location: neonatology department,"This identifies the encounter’s location as the neonatology department, specifying an environmental setting. In SNOMED CT, that maps to 'Neonatology department (environment)' SCTID 1279968000 within the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. No modifiers such as ICU, ward, or outpatient clinic are present, so more specific or different department/unit concepts (e.g., NICU) are not indicated."
64003000,Enchelyopus cimbrius (organism),Fourbeard rockling (Enchelyopus cimbrius),"This entry uses the accepted common name ‘fourbeard rockling’ and provides the scientific binomial in parentheses, both referring to the same species. The main concept is an organism and belongs in the SNOMED CT Organism category, precisely corresponding to SCTID 64003000. Using the common name does not alter attributes or introduce context such as exposure or disease; it is a clinically safe synonym. More general parents (e.g., rocklings or fish) are less precise, and sibling species of rocklings would be incorrect because the binomial uniquely defines Enchelyopus cimbrius."
1263780009,Internal gastrointestinal vibratory stimulation system capsule (physical object),Internal GI vibration-stimulation system capsule component,"“Vibration-stimulation” is a paraphrase of vibratory stimulation; “component” clarifies it is a part of the system. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This matches SCTID 1263780009 by specifying the capsule component of the internal GI vibration-stimulation system. It does not default to a parent system concept or to sibling devices (e.g., external controller). There are no added attributes beyond the device identity."
1162538001,Triceps skinfold percentile (observable entity),Triceps skinfold percentile value,"This denotes that the data element is the percentile value corresponding to the triceps skinfold measurement. As an Observable entity, it maps to Triceps skinfold percentile (SCTID 1162538001). It is specific to the triceps site and to the percentile statistic, avoiding conflation with absolute measurement observables or z-scores, and does not introduce other attributes, making siblings or parent concepts less appropriate."
215541008,"Hit by falling object due to accident to watercraft, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)",Struck by a falling object during a small unpowered boat accident; patient injured,"This entry includes the mechanism (struck by a falling object), the context (accident involving a small unpowered boat as watercraft), and that the person was injured as an occupant. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It aligns with the concept requiring all three elements and avoids introducing injury details or specific boat types beyond 'small unpowered boat.' Parents like 'accident to watercraft' alone are too broad, and siblings such as powered watercraft occupants do not fit. 'Struck' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'hit,' preserving code selection for 215541008."
764445001,Cytologic material (substance),Cytology material (substance),"Explicitly labeling it as a substance clarifies the hierarchy and aligns perfectly with cytologic material. No extra attributes such as site, adequacy, or collection method are included. Category: Substance. SCTID 764445001 is the precise match. Using a specimen concept or a broader material term would either add the wrong hierarchy or reduce specificity."
88959008,"Hypodermic needle, device (physical object)",Hypodermic needle in medication cart,"This identifies a hypodermic needle device, providing only storage context. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is Hypodermic needle, device, SCTID 88959008, under Physical object (Device). The phrasing does not add features like safety design, retractability, or gauge, and therefore neither a broader parent concept nor a narrower child concept would be a more accurate code choice."
445674006,Verbal report (record artifact),Verbal report to patient,"The entry identifies a report delivered verbally and notes the recipient is the patient. The main concept is still the verbal report artifact; recipient context does not change the artifact type. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This maps to Verbal report (record artifact), not to patient education or consent artifacts, and is more specific than generic 'Report'."
264027001,Ileorectal (qualifier value),Segment linkage: ileorectal,"The entry indicates “ileorectal” as the value for segment linkage, pointing to the ileum–rectum relationship. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The phrasing remains an attribute value and avoids implying procedures (e.g., anastomosis) or disorders (e.g., fistula). Other linkage values (e.g., ileocolic) are not expressed. SCTID 264027001 uniquely captures this specific pairing."
422563005,Assessment AND plan section (record artifact),Assessment and plan section in the chart,"The entry identifies the chart’s section that combines assessment and plan, a record artifact component. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 422563005 precisely matches the Assessment AND Plan section. A parent concept like a general chart section is too broad, and sibling concepts that separate assessment or plan are incomplete. The contextual reference to the chart does not introduce new clinical attributes; it locates the section within the record."
417217005,Visceral manipulation (procedure),Patient reports visceral manipulation,"The entry captures a patient-reported statement about undergoing visceral manipulation, without adding indications or anatomical specifics beyond viscera generally. It is a Procedure concept. Patient-reported context does not alter the procedure being referenced; SNOMED CT 417217005 is appropriate. Parent categories are overly broad, and siblings such as spinal or joint manipulation do not match the visceral target. No organ-level detail is present, so child concepts are not suitable."
787209003,Domestic physical abuse of adult (event),Adult domestic physical abuse,"This is a re-ordered but semantically equivalent expression that conveys the same three elements: domestic context, physical abuse, and adult victim. Category: Event. It maps precisely to SNOMED CT 787209003 because the abuse type (physical) and setting (domestic) are specified for an adult. Parent concepts lacking the physical qualifier or generic adult abuse are too broad, while siblings like intimate partner-specific abuse or non-physical abuse types are too narrow or different in kind. The word order change does not alter meaning or code selection."
16524291000119105,History of myalgia caused by statin (situation),History of statin-induced myalgia.,"The entry explicitly states a past history of myalgia and specifies statin as the causal agent, matching the concept of a historical situation of muscle pain caused by statin exposure. The main medical concepts are myalgia (muscle pain) and statin causality, with the temporal attribute of history. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. This is the most precise fit for SCTID 16524291000119105 because it captures both the historical context and the drug cause. Parent concepts like generic “History of myalgia” lack the statin cause, sibling concepts like “History of drug-induced myalgia” do not specify the drug, and child concepts with specific statin names would be overly specific. The phrasing “statin-induced” is clinically equivalent to “caused by statin” and does not alter code selection."
285330001,Red light (physical force),Room lighting: red light,"The entry documents that the room lighting is red, which directly references the physical force of red light. The category is Physical force; Red light (physical force) [285330001] is the correct code. Parent concepts for light in general would omit the color specification, and sibling colors or non-visible ranges are not consistent. The presence of ‘room lighting’ is contextual metadata and does not introduce additional attributes (e.g., exposure, therapy, device)."
224713004,Area at back of house (environment),Area at back side of house,"The wording 'back side of house' aligns with the intent of 'area at back of house,' indicating the rear location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 224713004 is the accurate selection since the phrase does not specify a particular structure or different location. Parent categories lack specificity, while siblings (front/side areas) or narrower children (yard/patio) would misrepresent the text."
118402009,"Clubfoot cast, device (physical object)",Clubfoot cast apparatus,"Using “apparatus” as a synonym for device, this entry still denotes a cast specifically for clubfoot, matching “Clubfoot cast, device” (SCTID: 118402009). Category: Physical object (Device). It references the object class and indication without adding attributes like material, laterality, or procedure state. A general cast apparatus parent would be less precise, and sibling devices (splints/orthoses) are excluded by specifying a cast. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not change the coding."
788541006,Product containing synthetic cannabinoid (product),Synthetic cannabinoid-containing product,"The entry identifies a product whose contents include a synthetic cannabinoid. This is a Product concept in SNOMED CT and corresponds to Product containing synthetic cannabinoid (SCTID 788541006). No additional qualifiers (e.g., brand, route, dose, therapeutic intent) are present. A sibling such as Product containing natural cannabinoid would be incorrect because the wording specifies synthetic. More specific child concepts naming individual synthetic cannabinoids are not implied here."
257698009,School (environment),School environment,"The phrase denotes the school as an environmental context without adding any specifics, mapping cleanly to SNOMED CT School (environment) 257698009. The concept here is the environment of a school, which falls under the Environment or geographical location category. It avoids introducing attributes like type, role, or events. Parents such as “Educational institution (environment)” are less specific than “School,” and children like “High school (environment)” are inappropriate because the entry does not constrain to a subtype. Sibling environments (home, workplace) are not suggested. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym that retains the same code selection."
233475003,Superficialization of vessel for vascular access (procedure),Patient states: vessel was superficialized for vascular access,"This patient-reported phrasing conveys the same underlying procedure—superficialization of a vessel for access—without specifying a particular vessel or other attributes. The main concept is a Procedure. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 233475003 is the most accurate code. More general parent concepts are not precise enough, while children (e.g., named vessel superficialization, AV fistula superficialization) introduce specificity not present here. The patient phrasing remains clinically equivalent."
1351653002,"Stem cells, apheresis (product)",Record entry: stem cell product (apheresis),"The core concept is a stem cell product with apheresis indicated as the method of collection, clearly a Product category concept. Category: Product. The documentation context ('Record entry') does not add medical attributes or alter the product semantics. This should be coded to SCTID 1351653002, not to a generic stem cell product parent or to procedural concepts, and no source-specific sibling detail is implied."
276339004,Environment (environment),Environment—no qualifiers,"This entry states the environment concept and explicitly indicates there are no additional qualifiers, ensuring a generic interpretation. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, with the appropriate code 'Environment (environment)' SCTID 276339004. It does not introduce any attributes that would map to child concepts or suggest parent/sibling categories (e.g., exposure, location qualifiers). The phrasing maintains clinical equivalence to the base term without altering code selection."
1304294007,Ability to distinguish internal mental experiences from external reality (observable entity),Psych notation: reality testing ability,"Framed as documentation context (‘Psych notation’), the core concept remains the ability for reality testing, i.e., distinguishing internal mental experiences from external reality. This is an observable entity and matches SNOMED CT 1304294007. The context does not add attributes; it merely reflects clinical documentation style. Sibling constructs like judgment or insight would be different, and child findings would imply a result, which is not present."
168531007,Radiotherapy started (situation),Radiation therapy course initiated,"The wording shows the initiation of a radiotherapy course, with no added specifics such as modality, intent, or timing. The main concept is radiotherapy start status, mapping to Radiotherapy started (situation), SCTID 168531007, which is a Situation concept for treatment status. Broader parent concepts and sibling statuses ('planned,' 'in progress,' 'completed') are not as precise for this explicit initiation wording. The phrase uses synonyms ('radiation therapy' and 'initiated') that are clinically equivalent to 'radiotherapy started.'"
78112006,Mycobacterium phlei (organism),Patient reports the bacteria named ‘Mycobacterium phlei’,"In a patient-reported context, the term still identifies only the organism’s species name without adding clinical attributes like site or infection. The concept is the organism; SNOMED CT category Organism. Mycobacterium phlei (78112006) is the precise code. Using the parent genus would be less specific, and there is no strain or alternative species mentioned, so child or sibling concepts are not appropriate."
309164002,Upper respiratory swab specimen (specimen),Specimen type: upper respiratory swab,"The entry identifies the specimen type as a swab from the upper respiratory tract. This is a Specimen concept and precisely maps to Upper respiratory swab specimen (SCTID 309164002). It avoids specifying individual subsites (e.g., nose, throat), as well as any test or clinical indication, preventing drift into child concepts or procedures. A parent concept such as upper respiratory specimen without the swab modality would be less specific. The phrasing is a documentation-style articulation that remains synonymous with the target concept."
282896007,Unable to alternate between sitting and standing (finding),Patient unable to switch back and forth between sitting and standing.,"The phrase explicitly describes inability to alternate positions in both directions between sitting and standing. It adds no extra attributes such as assistance or reason. As a Clinical finding, it maps precisely to 282896007. Codes for general transfer problems or inability to stand alone would not capture the required alternation. “Switch back and forth” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of “alternate,” preserving the exact concept."
439521002,Magnetization transfer imaging (procedure),MTI (magnetization transfer imaging),"The acronym 'MTI' with its expansion clearly indicates magnetization transfer imaging as a procedure. The main concept is the imaging procedure; SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This is a common clinical shorthand and is semantically equivalent to the preferred term without introducing new attributes. Coding to generic MRI would be less specific, and no evidence supports an anatomy-specific or quantitative variant; hence SCTID 439521002 fits best."
397942001,History of anesthesia problem (situation),Previously experienced anesthesia problem (history),"This entry states the patient previously experienced an anesthesia problem and clarifies it as history, without naming a specific type. Main concept: past anesthesia problem; attribute: prior experience/history. Category: Situation. SCTID 397942001 is the correct code, as it reflects the historical context of anesthesia problems. Coding to Complication of anesthesia (disorder) would inappropriately represent an active clinical event, and coding to specific complication histories would add detail not present. The phrasing is a synonymic paraphrase consistent with the concept."
729160008,Entire surface of labium minorum (body structure),Topographic site: entire surface of labia minora,"This entry provides a topographic context while clearly stating the anatomical site as the entire surface of the labia minora. The main concept is a body structure surface with total coverage. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 729160008 is the precise match because the phrase includes both the specific structure and the qualifier ‘entire surface.’ Parent concepts that lack the extent and sibling concepts that refer to the entire organ would be less appropriate. No new attributes (laterality, severity, timing) are introduced."
388996001,Genus Oryzorictes (organism),Genus Oryzorictes,"This explicitly names the taxonomic rank (genus) and the name Oryzorictes, identifying the organism concept at genus level. In SNOMED CT, the category is Organism, and the exact match is Genus Oryzorictes (organism) [388996001]. The wording does not introduce any clinical attributes or indicate a specific species, making parent concepts (higher taxa) too broad and child concepts (species within Oryzorictes) too narrow. The rank qualifier reinforces that this is not a sibling concept such as another genus."
108340002,"Economic status, general class (social concept)","Patient economic class, general","This entry denotes the patient's economic status in terms of general class without introducing any specific level or related social determinants; it is a social concept. SNOMED CT category: Social concept. The correct code is 108340002 Economic status, general class, which reflects the general-class classification. Using codes for socioeconomic status, income level, or financial insecurity would misrepresent the stated scope. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym focused on general class."
699031010000102,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Phaseolus vulgaris - red (substance),Immunoglobulin G against red common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris),"This entry indicates an IgG antibody against red common bean, and explicitly names Phaseolus vulgaris to ensure correct species/variety. The main concept is a substance (antibody) with defined specificity, and no diagnostic or observable attributes are introduced. It is best coded as Immunoglobulin G antibody to Phaseolus vulgaris - red (SCTID: 699031010000102). Using a parent concept for Phaseolus vulgaris without the red qualifier or a sibling for a different immunoglobulin class would be less accurate."
422861003,Burman projection (qualifier value),Label as Burman view,"The entry instructs labeling images with the Burman view, which is synonymous with the projection. The concept is the Burman projection (Qualifier value), with no additional attributes. 422861003 exactly matches. Parent projection concepts are too general, and sibling named views are not appropriate given the eponym specified. No further qualifiers (site, laterality) are present, so no child concept applies."
88811000119104,History of ductal carcinoma in situ of breast (situation),Past medical history: breast ductal carcinoma in situ,"This phrasing places breast ductal carcinoma in situ within the past medical history, clearly indicating a historical context. The main concept is DCIS of the breast; the attribute is past/personal history. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It matches the specific code for history of DCIS of breast, not the current disorder DCIS, and not the broader history of malignant breast cancer. The structure is a standard PMH statement and adds no extra attributes such as laterality or treatment."
705721002,Surgical adhesive/sealant applicator (physical object),Equipment required: surgical adhesive/sealant applicator,"The entry identifies the needed equipment as an applicator for surgical adhesives and sealants, without details about material type or mechanism. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It matches SCTID 705721002 by explicitly tying the applicator to both adhesive and sealant in the surgical setting. More general equipment terms would be insufficiently specific, and single-material applicators would be overly narrow. The requirement context does not add clinical attributes and preserves the device concept."
284176003,Geographical terrestrial feature (environment),Clinician free-text term: terrestrial geographic feature,"As free-text, the core meaning remains a terrestrial geographic feature without specification. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The terrestrial constraint excludes aquatic features and maintains generality, so a child concept is not implied. SCTID 284176003 is the precise code. The contextual label is not an attribute of the concept and does not affect coding."
346454001,Gluten-free biscuits and crackers (product),Item requested: gluten-free biscuits and crackers,"The request names the specific product category—gluten-free biscuits and crackers—without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 346454001 is appropriate because it captures both biscuits and crackers and the gluten-free property. Parent categories like gluten-free foods lack specificity, and child/sibling concepts focusing on only biscuits or only crackers would not match the requested combined product."
65615007,Blastomyces dermatitidis (organism),Follow-up: Provided information on Blastomyces dermatitidis,"This entry notes that information was provided about the organism Blastomyces dermatitidis, without stating detection or disease. The concept fits SNOMED CT’s Organism category and maps specifically to Blastomyces dermatitidis (organism). Parent genus or broader fungus concepts are overly general, and selecting a disorder or presence finding would add attributes not supported by the wording."
79680001,Sporotrichum proteinase I (substance),Proteinase I (Sporotrichum),"This phrasing identifies the same specific substance by placing the isoform designation (I) before the organism name in parentheses, which is clinically equivalent to the preferred term. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It precisely matches SCTID 79680001 for Sporotrichum proteinase I, whereas a parent like generic proteinases or a sibling such as a different isoform (e.g., proteinase II) would not be accurate. The parentheses do not introduce new clinical attributes; they only reformat the synonym."
226415008,Processed cheese intake (observable entity),Diet includes processed cheese,"This phrasing indicates the presence of processed cheese as part of the patient's diet, which corresponds to intake without adding frequency, quantity, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity; the precise match is Processed cheese intake (226415008). Mapping to Cheese intake or Dairy product intake would be less specific, and mapping to any narrower processed cheese subtype would be unjustified. The wording is a clinically equivalent expression of intake."
773592005,Occupational health care plan (record artifact),Occupational medicine care plan,"“Occupational medicine” is a clinically equivalent term for the occupational health specialty, and paired with “care plan” it denotes the same artifact. This is categorized as a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. The best code is “Occupational health care plan (record artifact)” because it represents a plan-of-care document specific to occupational/occupational medicine practice. Parent concepts like “Care plan” are less specific, and sibling documents like “Occupational health assessment report” reflect evaluations rather than plans. No added attributes (e.g., diagnosis, severity, timing) are included."
787148009,Digital representation of specimen (record artifact),Specimen representation in digital form,"This phrasing emphasizes the digital form of the specimen representation, aligning cleanly with the preferred concept. The main concept is a record artifact, and no additional attributes (modality, subtype, status) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 787148009 is the best match because it conveys digital representation of a specimen. The parent concept without 'specimen' would be too broad. Media-type-specific children would be too narrow and not indicated. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent and uniquely maps to the given concept."
467358003,Contaminated waste receptacle (physical object),Contaminated waste storage receptacle,"The entry references a receptacle for storage of contaminated waste, which is a physical object; contamination is specified, and no other attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. “Storage” indicates purpose but does not alter the core concept, so this remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term. SCTID 467358003 is the correct match. A parent “waste receptacle” lacks the contamination qualifier, while sibling or child concepts that narrow by waste content type or hazard classification would not reflect the general contaminated waste wording used here."
1306627004,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of right half of face with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Right 45-degree facial oblique extraoral photo with lips at rest and teeth in centric occlusion.,"This wording identifies an extraoral photograph of the face taken at a right oblique 45-degree angle, with lips at rest and teeth in centric occlusion, matching the defined attributes of SCTID 1306627004 (Record artifact). Using 'oblique' and 'at rest' are clinically equivalent synonyms for a 45° view and relaxed lips, respectively. It excludes other positions (e.g., profile 90°, frontal) or lip postures (smile, retraction), so parent or sibling concepts are not a better fit."
16205000,"Total repair of truncus arteriosus, Rastelli type operation (procedure)",Operative report: Rastelli procedure for total truncus arteriosus repair,"This entry represents a cardiac surgical Procedure documented in an operative report: a Rastelli procedure applied to achieve total repair of truncus arteriosus. The content clearly identifies the full correction and the technique, aligning exactly with 'Total repair of truncus arteriosus, Rastelli type operation' in SNOMED CT. Generic truncus repair concepts lack the technique specification, and Rastelli procedures for other diagnoses would not match the stated truncus arteriosus."
244533009,Entire intervertebral symphysis between L4 and L5 (body structure),Interbody articulation L4 to L5 (entire symphysis),"‘Interbody articulation’ in the lumbar spine refers to the symphysis formed by the intervertebral disc between adjacent vertebral bodies. Adding ‘entire symphysis’ ensures the whole joint is meant. Category: Body structure. This avoids mapping to child components (disc parts or space) or sibling facets, and the L4–L5 level specificity avoids parent generic codes. SCTID 244533009 precisely represents this structure."
446084001,Modified Harris hip score (observable entity),Outcome measure: Modified Harris Hip Score,"This phrasing identifies the Modified Harris Hip Score as the outcome measure, making the score the central concept. It maps to an Observable entity category. The correct SNOMED CT code is 446084001, specific to the modified instrument and not the original Harris hip score or other hip outcome tools. The descriptor 'outcome measure' is contextual and does not affect code selection."
411685006,Elettaria cardamomum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Lab requisition specifies Elettaria cardamomum diagnostic allergen extract as the reagent.,"This entry indicates that the lab requisition calls for the Elettaria cardamomum diagnostic allergen extract as the reagent, clearly identifying a diagnostic product used in allergy testing. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 411685006 precisely captures this diagnostic allergen extract. Using a generic parent code would omit the species, and selecting a sibling like the therapeutic extract would misstate the intent. The term “reagent” is clinically equivalent to diagnostic allergen extract and adds no attributes such as test results or administration details, ensuring the correct product concept is selected."
1144851009,Sparse growth of hair of axilla (finding),Sparse axillary hair growth,"The statement explicitly identifies sparse growth of hair localized to the axilla, matching 'Sparse growth of hair of axilla (finding)' SCTID 1144851009. Main concept: reduced axillary hair growth. Category: Clinical finding. It excludes attributes like cause, severity, or laterality. It is not better coded as 'loss of axillary hair' (absence) or as a general hypotrichosis disorder; the wording targets the exact site and finding."
177916006,Resuture of burst abdomen (procedure),Surgical resuturing of burst abdomen,"Main concept: surgical resuturing for burst abdomen. Category: Procedure. The word 'surgical' maintains the procedural nature and does not add specificity beyond standard operative context. The combination of resuturing and burst abdomen maps exactly to SNOMED CT 177916006. Parent concepts (generic repair) or children (specific suture types, layers) are not indicated."
17237008,Burning vapor (physical force),Scalding vapour,"This British spelling denotes the same concept: vapor at scalding temperatures, i.e., burning vapor. There are no added qualifiers or events. It is a Physical force in SNOMED CT and maps to Burning vapor (physical force) [17237008]. Concepts for general gases or specific steam are not indicated, keeping the selection precise."
257163007,DRB1*1402 (substance),DRB1*1402,"The entry names the specific HLA antigen DRB1*1402 without any added context that implies presence, test results, or clinical status. The main medical concept is the HLA DRB1*1402 antigen itself. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the most precise match is SCTID 257163007 (DRB1*1402 (substance)). Using only the exact designation ensures this does not shift to a parent concept like broader HLA-DR antigens or to sibling alleles (e.g., DRB1*1401). No attributes such as positivity, timing, or clinical associations are introduced, so the code selection remains uniquely the specific substance."
22575004,Middle class economic status (social concept),"Patient statement: ""I am middle class,"" documented as economic status","This patient-reported statement, documented as economic status, conveys middle class economic status, a Social concept. The quotation is a source detail and does not introduce new attributes. Broader economic status or sibling categories (upper/lower class) would not be as precise. SCTID 22575004 is the correct code."
431638008,Genus Garciella (organism),Genus: Garciella (organism),"This entry explicitly states the rank 'Genus' and the name 'Garciella', with a contextual note '(organism)'. It cleanly maps to SNOMED CT Organism concept Genus Garciella, SCTID 431638008. No species or clinical attributes are introduced, ensuring it does not fit better to a child (species) or a finding concept. The paraphrase is semantically identical to the preferred term."
119344008,Specimen from genital system (specimen),"Laboratory specimen, genital system origin","This clearly states that the specimen in the laboratory originated from the genital system. The main concept is specimen source; no additional attributes (type, subsite, sex, timing) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It precisely fits the given concept; parent concepts would be under-specified, and child/sibling concepts with specific genital organs or specimen forms would be over-specified relative to the entry."
1208743009,Animal material diagnostic allergen extract (product),Animal allergen diagnostic extract,"This entry expresses a diagnostic allergen extract from animals, maintaining the source and diagnostic intent without extra attributes such as species or dose form. Main concept: diagnostic allergen extract with animal origin; attributes: origin and diagnostic purpose. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps to SCTID 1208743009 rather than a generic diagnostic allergen extract (too broad) or species-specific extracts (too narrow). The synonymous phrasing “animal allergen diagnostic extract” remains within the same product definition and does not imply immunotherapy or other uses."
223852009,Overseas Departments of France (geographic location),French overseas administrative departments,"This synonym emphasizes 'administrative departments' while preserving the DOM meaning. The main concept is a geographic location. SCTID 223852009 is the correct, most specific code. A parent code for France would be too general, child codes would be too specific, and sibling concepts (territories/collectivities) are different. No extra attributes are present."
223871006,Cornwall (geographic location),"Cornwall, England — geographic location","This entry identifies 'Cornwall' and specifies 'England' while explicitly labeling it as a 'geographic location,' which does not add or change attributes beyond place identification. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location), Qualifier value. SCTID 223871006 for 'Cornwall (geographic location)' is the most precise match; parents like 'England' or 'United Kingdom' are overly broad, and siblings in other countries are excluded by the text. The wording remains a clinically equivalent representation of the preferred concept and does not alter code selection."
258883008,Colony-forming units/gram (qualifier value),cfu/g,"Lowercase cfu/g is an abbreviation used in laboratory notation for colony-forming units per gram. The concept here is strictly a unit of measure, not a result, and it includes the denominator gram, making it specific. The SNOMED category is Qualifier value. SCTID 258883008 is the precise match for CFU per gram. Parent concepts that omit the denominator or represent general unit categories are too broad, and sibling concepts like CFU/mL would be incorrect due to the different denominator. The lowercase abbreviation is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not alter semantics."
914001000000103,Percutaneous injection of sclerosing agent into great saphenous vein using ultrasonographic guidance (procedure),"Injection of sclerosing agent into the great saphenous vein, performed percutaneously with ultrasound guidance","This describes a Procedure featuring percutaneous injection of a sclerosing agent into the great saphenous vein using ultrasound guidance, aligning fully with SCTID 914001000000103. It is more specific than generic sclerotherapy or unguided variants and excludes procedures for other veins. The wording uses clinically equivalent terms without adding attributes such as timing or laterality."
1268891008,Presence of noninvasive premalignant neoplasm of appendix at surgical margin in appendectomy specimen (observable entity),Observed: noninvasive premalignant neoplasm present at surgical margin in appendix resection specimen.,"The entry documents observation of presence of a noninvasive premalignant appendiceal neoplasm at the surgical margin in an appendix resection (appendectomy) specimen. This is an Observable entity. SCTID 1268891008 accurately covers presence, premalignant noninvasive nature, appendiceal site, margin status, and specimen context. Parent concepts would be underspecified; sibling/child concepts like invasive disease or specific margin location would add details not stated. The wording uses 'observed' as context without altering the attributes of the concept."
11321000146101,Euthanasia request (record artifact),Patient’s euthanasia request documented,"The entry indicates that the patient's request for euthanasia has been documented, clearly pointing to a record artifact. The main concept is the documented request; there are no added attributes beyond documentation. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 11321000146101 is appropriate because it reflects a euthanasia request captured within the record. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling artifacts (e.g., DNR or POLST entries) are not the same request type. The refocusing on the patient’s request is a harmless paraphrase that does not change the coding."
228790005,Irradiated volume (observable entity),Measured irradiated volume,"This expression emphasizes that the observable (irradiated volume) has been measured, but no values are provided. It fits the Observable entity category and maps to SCTID 228790005. The verb 'measured' does not add dose levels, organ types, or time frames; it remains distinct from siblings like DVH metrics and from organ-specific child observables. Thus, Irradiated volume is the correct code selection."
16216211000119105,Endocervical aspirate (specimen),Endocervical aspirate documented in chart,"The entry indicates that the specimen type recorded is an endocervical aspirate, without test details or diagnoses. In SNOMED CT, this is a Specimen concept and matches Endocervical aspirate (specimen) [16216211000119105]. Parent terms would be overly general, and siblings change the collection method (swab, smear) or tissue type (biopsy). The phrasing retains the exact specimen characterization."
242298002,Accidental ingestion of paralytic shellfish (event),Patient accidentally ate paralytic shellfish,"This patient-reported statement clearly indicates eating (ingestion) of paralytic shellfish with accidental intent. The concept is an accidental ingestion event of a specific agent. Category: Event. The colloquial “ate” is clinically equivalent to ingestion, and “accidentally” preserves the accidental attribute, mapping exactly to Accidental ingestion of paralytic shellfish (SCTID 242298002). It excludes disorder semantics (no poisoning noted) and is more specific than generic accidental ingestion."
346624001,Product containing phenol structure (product),Medicine with phenolic moiety,"This denotes a medicine whose molecule includes a phenolic moiety, i.e., a phenol structure, mapping to 'Product containing phenol structure (product)' SCTID 346624001. Main concept: product; attribute: phenolic moiety (structural feature). Category: Product. The wording does not introduce specifics of ingredient, dose form, or brand, avoiding child concepts. 'Phenolic moiety' is a chemical synonym for 'phenol structure,' making it clinically equivalent without altering code selection."
422273006,Gentian + sodium bicarbonate (product),Sodium bicarbonate with gentian product,"The entry identifies a product comprising sodium bicarbonate together with gentian, with no added attributes like form, dose, or indication. The category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It precisely matches SCTID 422273006 because it names both ingredients of the defined combination product. Using only one ingredient would map to a parent concept, and specifying dosage forms or strengths would map to a child concept, which is not indicated here. The reversed order of ingredients is a harmless synonymic variation and does not change the code."
169276003,Magnetic field for diagnosis (procedure),Diagnostic modality: magnetic field,"This indicates a diagnostic modality where the method involves a magnetic field, matching the Procedure concept 169276003. The entry does not introduce specific submodalities (MRI, MRA) or anatomical sites, avoiding more specific children or siblings. It is more precise than a generic modality listing because it names the agent, and the term “modality” is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not alter the procedural concept."
214267005,"Motor vehicle traffic accident involving collision, on highway, between motor vehicle and animal, passenger of motor vehicle injured (event)",Traffic accident on a highway where a motor vehicle collided with an animal; passenger injured.,"This entry clearly indicates a traffic accident on a highway with a motor vehicle-animal collision and identifies the injured party as the passenger. It corresponds exactly to the SNOMED CT Event 214267005. More general parent concepts lack one or more of these attributes, and siblings involving different injured parties or non-animal collisions would not fit. The wording remains within the bounds of the specified event without adding detail."
1201972005,Pseudomonas brassicae (organism),Pseudomonas brassicae,"The entry explicitly names the species Pseudomonas brassicae, which is a taxonomic organism designation without any clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the most precise match is SCTID 1201972005 for Pseudomonas brassicae (organism). No details of infection, detection, severity, or host are introduced, so parent concepts like Pseudomonas (genus) or generic Bacterium are too broad, and sibling species (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or strain-level children are not indicated."
371503009,Neoplasm weight (observable entity),Weight of tumor,"This entry describes the weight attribute of a tumor, which is clinically equivalent to neoplasm weight. It fits the observable entity Neoplasm weight (371503009). The wording does not imply malignant status, specific body site, timing, or measurement method, thereby not suggesting any child or procedural concept. It is distinct from generic weight measures and from other tumor properties (size, volume), so 371503009 is optimal."
102434004,"Exposure to polluted soil, non-occupational (event)","Environmental history: polluted soil exposure, non-occupational.","The documented concept is an exposure to polluted soil occurring in a non-occupational context, captured in an environmental history. Category: Event. SCTID 102434004 precisely represents a non-work-related polluted soil exposure event. A more general exposure history without specifying soil or non-occupational would not be as specific, and an occupational exposure sibling would be incorrect. The phrasing does not introduce timing, severity, or causative agents beyond polluted soil."
422252006,Rhode Island (geographic location),State of Rhode Island,"This text explicitly indicates Rhode Island as a state, which is inherent to the concept and adds no extraneous attributes. The main concept is the geographic location Rhode Island. The SNOMED category is Location—geographic location. SCTID 422252006 is the exact code for Rhode Island and is preferred over broader parents like any generic United States state concept or siblings such as another state. The phrasing “State of” is a clinically safe synonym clarifying the type of location and does not change the intended code selection."
109010000,Microfibrillar collagen hemostat (substance),Microfibrillar collagen hemostat listed among materials,"The entry notes the substance as part of materials, keeping the precise identification of microfibrillar collagen hemostat. The main concept is the substance; no procedure or condition is added. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps directly to the given concept and is more specific than Collagen (substance) or generic hemostatic agents. Mentioning materials does not shift the concept to a product classification; it remains the substance."
1380014009,Union for International Cancer Control aN1a(sn) (qualifier value),TNM (UICC) nodal category: aN1a(sn),"This entry indicates the TNM nodal category per UICC and provides the exact value 'aN1a(sn)'. The concept here is the UICC TNM qualifier for N classification using autopsy ('a') and sentinel node methodology ('sn'), subclass '1a'. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It aligns precisely with SCTID 1380014009. Broader or different codes such as N1a without 'a' or '(sn)', or other prefixes (c, p, y, r) would be inappropriate, and aN1b(sn) would be a sibling with a different subcategory. The phrasing 'TNM (UICC)' is a clear synonym referencing the same system without altering the attributes."
146799005,Possible pregnancy (situation),"Patient states: ""I may be pregnant.""","A direct patient quotation asserting possible pregnancy conveys uncertainty without confirmation or extra attributes. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Situation, with the most precise match being 146799005 Possible pregnancy (situation). Use of patient voice does not alter the concept; it remains possible pregnancy rather than confirmed or unknown. No testing, timing, or associated conditions are implied."
218053001,Accident caused by hand or treadle sewing machine (event),Accident due to manual (non-electric) sewing machine,"This entry conveys an accident caused by a manual, non-electric sewing machine, which is semantically equivalent to hand- or treadle-operated devices covered by 'Accident caused by hand or treadle sewing machine' (SCTID 218053001). It belongs to the Event category, capturing the causal mechanism without adding injury or contextual attributes. The 'non-electric' qualifier excludes powered devices, preventing misclassification to the sibling 'powered sewing machine' accident. It is therefore the most precise match versus broader parent concepts."
289691003,Gravid uterus deviated to left (finding),Left-deviation of the uterus in pregnancy observed,"This states that the uterus in pregnancy (gravid) has a left deviation, observed clinically. Attributes include pregnancy and left laterality. It is a Clinical finding; SCTID 289691003 is the correct specific code. More general findings without gravid context or different laterality would be inappropriate. The phrasing is equivalent to the preferred term; “observed” is context and does not introduce new attributes."
38586004,Laser-generated electromagnetic radiation (physical force),Electromagnetic emission of laser origin,"This describes an electromagnetic emission whose origin is a laser, focusing on the physical agent rather than any device use or exposure. As a Physical force, SCTID 38586004 captures this exactly. A parent concept omits the laser origin, while children that specify characteristics such as spectrum or pulse would add attributes not present. “Emission” is synonymous with radiation here and keeps the code choice unchanged."
63060009,Salmonella Huvudsta (organism),Organism name listed: Salmonella Huvudsta,"The entry simply records the organism name in a listing context, without asserting detection or disease. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 63060009 best fits the explicit organism naming. A parent Salmonella concept would be insufficiently specific; siblings (other serovars) would be wrong. No presence or infection is mentioned, so finding or disorder concepts are less appropriate."
896794008,Measured quantity of intake of soy protein in 24 hours (observable entity),Daily (24-hour) soy protein intake—measured,"The entry denotes a measured daily intake explicitly clarified as a 24-hour interval, focused on soy protein. The main concept is soy protein intake; attributes are quantification and the 24-hour timeframe. It is an Observable entity. The explicit ‘24-hour’ disambiguates ‘daily’ to match SCTID 896794008 precisely. This avoids mapping to average daily intake or different time windows, and it does not introduce abnormality, method, or source. Thus, it remains the most precise match over parent/sibling concepts."
768169003,Genus Holdemanella (organism),"Organism: Holdemanella, genus level","The text identifies Holdemanella as an organism at the genus level, with the attribute 'genus level' clearly specifying taxonomic rank and not indicating detection or clinical association. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This corresponds exactly to Genus Holdemanella (organism), SCTID 768169003. More general parents (e.g., Bacteria) would not capture the genus name, and species-level concepts would add specificity not present here. The phrasing remains strictly taxonomic."
127460002,Tissue specimen from pleura (specimen),Requisition lists specimen as pleural tissue,"This requisition line explicitly labels the specimen as pleural tissue, capturing both the material (tissue) and source (pleura). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The exact match is Tissue specimen from pleura (127460002). It avoids procedure-type qualifiers and fluid/cytology descriptions, ruling out children and siblings. The wording is an acceptable synonym, preserving the concept without changing code selection."
223506007,Indian subcontinent (geographic location),Indian subcontinent locale,"This phrasing uses 'locale' to denote the same geographic entity, adding no clinical modifiers. The SNOMED CT category is geographic location. SCTID 223506007 is appropriate because it names the Indian subcontinent explicitly; broader parent concepts are imprecise and narrower children or sibling regions do not match the wording. 'Locale' is a semantically equivalent descriptor of place and does not introduce new attributes."
466372001,Wheelchair glove (physical object),Wheelchair glove referenced in discharge summary,"The entry notes inclusion of the item in a discharge summary, but the coded concept is the wheelchair glove. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It aligns with SCTID 466372001 as the item is a glove intended for wheelchair use. A generic glove code would dilute specificity, and other wheelchair equipment concepts would be incorrect. The documentation context does not introduce new attributes such as timing or laterality."
328722006,Gluten-free pastry mix (product),Cooking class supply: gluten-free pastry mix,"This supply item is specified as a gluten-free pastry mix, corresponding precisely to 'Gluten-free pastry mix (product)' SCTID 328722006. The main concept is a product intended for pastry that is gluten-free; the context of a class supply does not introduce product variations. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Generic pastry mix or different gluten-free categories would be less accurate, so the specific code is appropriate."
11803003,Electricity /110 volt/ (physical force),History notes: electricity at 110 V,"Although presented as a history section label, the entry’s core concept is electricity at 110 volts, with no added qualifiers such as timing of exposure or injury. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and Electricity /110 volt/ [11803003] is the most accurate match. The parent electricity concept is insufficiently specific, and sibling entries for other voltages would be wrong. The contextual phrase 'History notes' does not alter the concept being represented."
430711004,Family history of seizure disorder (situation),Chart lists family history of seizure disorder,"The entry states that the chart includes an item indicating family history of seizure disorder, reflecting a Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT 430711004 is the most accurate code for this content. Broader codes for family history are not specific enough, and more specific sibling concepts (like family history of epilepsy) are not mentioned. The phrase “chart lists” addresses documentation status only and does not introduce new clinical attributes."
700610003,Anesthesia/respiratory gas flowmeter tester (physical object),Anesthesia/respiratory gas flowmeter test box,"The term ‘test box’ is a common colloquial synonym for a tester unit, here specified for anesthesia/respiratory gas flowmeters. The concept is a Physical object and corresponds to SCTID 700610003. It avoids mapping to parent general testers by including the domain and does not refer to the flowmeter itself (sibling). The synonym does not introduce new attributes and maintains unique codability to the intended device."
411733001,Ocimum basilicum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) diagnostic allergen extract,"This entry uses the common name “sweet basil” paired with the scientific name “Ocimum basilicum,” ensuring species specificity and avoiding ambiguity with other basil species. It clearly states a diagnostic allergen extract, making it a Product and aligning to SCTID 411733001. The synonym use of sweet basil is clinically equivalent to Ocimum basilicum. Broader parents lack species detail, and siblings such as therapeutic allergen extracts are excluded because diagnostic intent is specified."
717306001,IV insulin syringe (physical object),Pre-procedure checklist includes an IV insulin syringe,"This notes the presence of an IV insulin syringe on a checklist, referring to a Physical object. SCTID 717306001 is the precise mapping. Parent or generic syringe concepts are less specific, and procedure or order/request concepts would shift focus away from the device itself. The checklist context remains purely referential and does not add attributes such as sterility or size."
285664006,Pressure change (physical force),Pressure change reported by patient,"This entry captures the same physical force concept, with the phrase 'reported by patient' providing source context without changing the meaning of pressure change. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It maps to Pressure change (physical force) [285664006] because no physiologic measurement or directional attribute is included. Sibling or child concepts with body-site specificity or increase/decrease are excluded by the neutral wording."
218164000,Accident caused by electric current (event),Accident secondary to electric current,"‘Secondary to’ is a standard causal phrase indicating that the accident resulted from electric current. The primary concept is an unintentional event with a specified electric current cause, fitting the Event category and SCTID 218164000. Parent or sibling concepts without the accident element or without the electric current causation (e.g., general exposure) would be less accurate. It avoids mentioning injuries, burns, fatalities, or settings, so it remains uniquely codable to this event."
55351009,Implosion (physical force),Category selected: implosion (physical force),"This entry indicates that the selected category for the force type is implosion, which matches the SNOMED CT Physical force concept. It adds no extra attributes and remains solely focused on the classification of force. Coding to the parent Physical force would be less specific, while sibling concepts (e.g., explosion, compression) would misrepresent the inward-collapse nature of implosion. The phrasing is equivalent and supports Implosion (physical force)."
216381007,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, stadium (environment)",Event took place in a stadium (accident/poisoning),"This wording conveys that the accident/poisoning event occurred in a stadium, emphasizing the place-of-occurrence only. It belongs to the Environment category. SCTID 216381007 is most precise because it specifies 'stadium' within the context of accident/poisoning place-of-occurrence. Parent concepts are too general; siblings such as 'arena' or 'sports area' would be different environments. The parenthetical clarification keeps the mapping unambiguous without adding other attributes."
405067000,Self-control: impulsive behavior (observable entity),Self-control: impulsive behavior assessed,"Stating that the self-control item for impulsive behavior was assessed still points to the observable variable itself without specifying results or severity. The category is Observable entity. This matches SCTID 405067000, and it is preferable to broader self-control observables or clinical findings—no diagnostic implication is made, just the presence of the assessment variable."
715045000,Able to obtain medication (finding),Ability to obtain medication,"This entry explicitly names the ability to obtain medication, directly matching the Clinical finding Able to obtain medication (715045000). It avoids additional qualifiers, focusing strictly on the capability. A parent concept about general ability or access would be less specific, and siblings concerning administration or compliance describe different aspects of medication usage. The phrasing is essentially the same as the preferred term, ensuring precise coding."
11645004,Spirit soluble aniline blue stain (substance),Ethanol-soluble aniline blue stain,"The entry specifies aniline blue that is soluble in ethanol, i.e., spirit-soluble, and calls it a stain, which is semantically equivalent to dye as a substance. This aligns with SNOMED CT Substance 11645004. Parent/sibling distinctions based on solubility are respected, because 'ethanol-soluble' rules out the water-soluble type and is more precise than generic 'aniline blue.' The wording does not introduce procedural steps or concentrations, keeping the selection firmly within the substance concept."
223914007,St. Marys (geographic location),Destination: St. Marys,"The destination is recorded as “St. Marys,” a named place corresponding to St. Marys (geographic location), SCTID: 223914007. Category: Location (geographic location). This context communicates a relation but does not change the entity type. Using a broader parent would lose the specific place-name, while any child requiring a jurisdiction is not warranted. There are no institutional or feature markers, avoiding sibling mappings."
60019003,Rhamnus cathartica (organism),Purging buckthorn species,"This entry uses the common name 'Purging buckthorn' with explicit species framing, which denotes Rhamnus cathartica in the Organism category. There are no clinical or derivative attributes present. A parent concept (genus) would be too broad, and sibling species or parts are not implied. SCTID 60019003 is the most specific, appropriate selection."
765433002,Product containing fluorine radioisotope (product),Pharmacy item: fluorine radioisotope-containing product,"Within a pharmacy context header, the phrase identifies a product that contains a fluorine radioisotope, without specifying isotope number, preparation, or brand. Main concept: product with fluorine radioisotope ingredient. Category: Product. SCTID 765433002 should be selected because it encodes exactly a product containing fluorine radioisotope. A parent concept would not constrain to fluorine, and a child that names fluorine-18 or a specific compound would be too detailed. The pharmacy header is contextual and does not change the coding."
695871010000106,Deoxyribonucleic acid of enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (substance),Target analyte for molecular test: EIEC DNA,"The phrase identifies the target analyte as EIEC DNA in a molecular testing context, but the core concept remains the substance, not a procedure or result. The main concept is DNA of enteroinvasive E. coli; no detection or severity is implied. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This is more specific than 'E. coli DNA' due to the enteroinvasive qualifier, and it does not suggest other molecular types like RNA or protein, making the given code the most precise match."
229869004,Vegetarian mincemeat (substance),Mincemeat (vegetarian),"This phrasing identifies the same substance, clarifying that the mincemeat is vegetarian. The main concept is a food substance and fits SNOMED CT's Substance category. The bracketed qualifier ensures it is not generic mincemeat and therefore maps specifically to 229869004. Parent concepts like generic mincemeat lack the vegetarian attribute; sibling concepts such as 'vegan mincemeat' or 'meat mincemeat' would be inaccurate. The synonym maintains identical meaning without changing code selection."
262101000,Ricketts bracket (physical object),Ricketts orthodontic bracket,"This explicitly identifies the bracket as the Ricketts design within orthodontic devices, maintaining the physical object context. It belongs to the Physical object (Device) category, and the adjective 'orthodontic' clarifies the device type without altering the concept. It is more specific than a parent concept such as 'orthodontic bracket' and does not suggest a procedure or finding, making SCTID 262101000 the most accurate code."
281246002,Musculoskeletal structure of neck (body structure),Neck musculoskeletal region (anatomy),"This entry describes the anatomical region of the neck in terms of its musculoskeletal structures, equivalent to musculoskeletal structure of neck. It represents a Body structure. SCTID 281246002 is the most precise match because it localizes musculoskeletal anatomy to the neck. Broader parents lacking the neck qualifier are not sufficiently specific, and more granular children (e.g., cervical facet joints, neck muscles) represent subsets not intended here. The parenthetical 'anatomy' clarifies context, not adding clinical attributes."
425823007,Warming-cooling mattress (physical object),ICU bed includes a warming-cooling mattress,"This documents the presence of a warming-cooling mattress on an ICU bed; the location context does not introduce different device attributes. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The best match is Warming-cooling mattress (SCTID 425823007), reflecting a mattress capable of both warming and cooling. More general parents like Mattress omit function, and single-mode siblings (warming-only or cooling-only) do not fit the dual capability. The ICU mention is contextual, keeping the mapping to the specific physical object intact."
47326004,"Electrical utilization equipment, device (physical object)",Electrical utilization equipment: device,"This documentation-style entry uses a colon to label the item as a device within the electrical utilization equipment class. The main concept is a physical object device under SNOMED CT. The entry contains no additional attributes (e.g., usage, condition, clinical specialty) and thus maps directly to the target concept. More general parents would not capture the utilization distinction, and narrower siblings would add specificity not present. The format is a synonymous presentation of the preferred term."
428498002,Assault by stranger (event),Assault by unknown person,"The main concept is an assault with the perpetrator described as unknown to the patient, which is clinically equivalent to ‘stranger’ and adds no extra attributes such as mechanism or timing. This is an Event in SNOMED CT. The phrase aligns best with SCTID 428498002. A parent concept like Assault (event) lacks the stranger-perpetrator detail, while siblings (e.g., assault by acquaintance or family) would contradict the unknown relationship indicated here."
73743005,"Oil of chamomile, German (substance)",German chamomile essential oil,"The term 'essential oil' properly denotes the oil form, and 'German chamomile' specifies the correct species, making this a SNOMED CT Substance matching Oil of chamomile, German (73743005). A parent like chamomile essential oil would be too vague, and a sibling like Roman chamomile essential oil would be different. No additional characteristics (dose, route, indication) are introduced, preserving precise substance-level coding."
464315008,Partial-foot prosthesis (physical object),Catalog item — partial-foot prosthesis,"This entry refers to the device as a catalog item, naming the partial-foot prosthesis. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The core concept is the physical object, mapping to 464315008. Catalog context does not change the device identity nor introduce attributes that would shift coding to procedures or findings."
463300004,Ophthalmic knife test drum (physical object),Ophthalmic knife test drum—equipment list entry,"The main concept is the ophthalmic knife test drum, with context indicating it appears on an equipment list. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. No additional attributes (size, brand, condition) are added. More general parent concepts or different siblings (e.g., keratome, ophthalmic knife) do not match. This is a direct representation of SCTID 463300004."
252478000,6-minute walk test (procedure),Performed 6-minute walk test,"The wording indicates the procedure was carried out, directly referencing the six‑minute walk test without adding details beyond its performance. The category is Procedure. This aligns precisely with SCTID 252478000. Parent concepts (general exercise testing) are too generic, and siblings like cardiopulmonary exercise testing reflect different methodologies. No measurement outcomes are included, so observable entity codes are not a fit."
426757001,French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group grading system (staging scale),FNCLCC grading system selected,"This concise statement indicates selection of the FNCLCC grading system, referencing the scale without specifying outcomes. The main concept is the FNCLCC grading system. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Staging scale (Qualifier value), and SCTID 426757001 maps exactly to the FNCLCC sarcoma grading system. Parent categories for generic scales are too broad, and child grade-level concepts would introduce details not present. The entry is a clear synonym for the same scale concept."
251048000,Cardiac ratio (observable entity),Cardiac ratio evaluation,"Although 'evaluation' can be a generic documentation term, the focus remains on the measurement variable 'cardiac ratio' and no numeric result, method, or clinical interpretation is provided. This is an Observable entity and maps to SCTID 251048000. It does not specifically indicate 'cardiothoracic ratio' nor any broader cardiac measurement class, and it does not imply a disorder or procedural coding, so the 'cardiac ratio' observable is the precise fit."
713098000,Education about hospitalization (procedure),Discussed hospitalization as patient education.,"The statement documents a discussion framed as patient education, with the explicit topic of hospitalization. No other attributes are provided. This is a Procedure and maps exactly to Education about hospitalization (713098000). Parent concepts like generic patient education would be underspecified, while sibling concepts about discharge or admission would not reflect the general hospitalization scope. “Discussed” within an education context is an accepted synonymic form and remains aligned with the same code."
6256009,Ribose isomerase (substance),Ribose isomerase noted in documentation,"This entry indicates that the named substance appears in documentation; the essential concept is ribose isomerase as an enzyme. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It fits SCTID 6256009 precisely because it specifies the exact enzyme without mentioning activities, assays, mutations, or substrate variants. Broader parents like Enzyme are too general, and sibling concepts such as glucose isomerase are different substances. The “noted in documentation” phrase is context only and does not alter the coded concept."
783332003,Clemastine fumarate hydrochloride (substance),Clemastine fumarate hydrochloride compound,"Calling it a “compound” still refers to the same chemical substance identity without introducing product form or usage details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the most accurate code is 783332003 for Clemastine fumarate hydrochloride. Choosing a parent (e.g., Clemastine) or other salts would not reflect the combined fumarate hydrochloride specification. The term “compound” is a neutral synonym in this context and does not change the code selection."
288493004,Percentage energy intake (qualifier value),Coding term: energy intake percentage,"Presented as a coding term, this entry conveys the concept of energy intake expressed in percentage terms without adding magnitude or context. It is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT. It should not be mapped to an observable measurement (kcal) or to a nutrient distribution percentage. Hence, SCTID 288493004 is the most accurate, while broader or different percentage concepts would be less appropriate."
16468541000119105,Exposure to Zika virus (event),EHR alert: exposure to Zika virus,"An electronic health record alert mentions exposure to Zika virus, which is an exposure event independent of disease status. The category is Event. SCTID 16468541000119105 is the most accurate code. Parents (e.g., Exposure to infectious agent) lack specificity; siblings reflect other agents. The entry does not introduce context like perinatal or occupational exposure, so a child concept is not indicated."
419891008,Record artifact (record artifact),Artifact within the patient record,"Stating that the artifact is within the patient record equates to 'record artifact.' This is a 'Special concept' in SNOMED CT (419891008). The phrase does not introduce causation, severity, or associated conditions, and it avoids misinterpretation as imaging or clinical finding artifacts, ensuring this code is the best match."
1380184000,Union for International Cancer Control y prefix (qualifier value),UICC y prefix qualifier,"Calling it a 'qualifier' correctly reflects the SNOMED CT category (Qualifier value) and directly points to the UICC y prefix concept SCTID 1380184000. The entry avoids any staging values, sites, or other attributes and specifies UICC and y, differentiating it from broader or sibling prefixes. Therefore, the UICC y prefix qualifier value is the precise match."
362544006,Entire ear lobule (body structure),Entire pinna lobule,"The term 'pinna' is a common synonym for 'auricle,' and 'lobule' identifies the specific anatomical segment. 'Entire' indicates the whole structure. Category: Body structure. This maps precisely to SCTID 362544006, not to the broader pinna or external ear structures. It avoids lateralized children and is more specific than the parent 'ear lobule structure' by denoting completeness."
279607004,Entire helix of ear (body structure),Whole auricle helix anatomy,"The wording denotes the anatomical helix of the auricle and specifies 'whole', meaning the entire structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 279607004 is the most precise match because it refers to the entire helix. 'Helix of ear' without 'whole' would be a broader parent. Sibling structures such as antihelix or lobule would be incorrect. The term 'anatomy' does not add attributes beyond identifying the structure."
16215731000119104,Endocardium biopsy specimen (specimen),Endocardial biopsy tissue sample,"The entry specifies a tissue sample obtained by biopsy from the endocardium, clearly portraying a specimen. It matches the Specimen concept Endocardium biopsy specimen (specimen), SCTID 16215731000119104. A generic cardiac sample (parent) would be less precise, and other cardiac structure specimens (siblings) would misclassify the tissue. 'Tissue sample' is a clinically acceptable synonym for 'specimen' without changing the code selection."
110921008,Right middle lobe bronchus cytologic material (specimen),Right middle lobe bronchus cell-based specimen for cytologic examination,The entry describes a cell-based specimen for cytologic examination obtained from the right middle lobe bronchus. Main concept: cytologic specimen; site: RML bronchus. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. 'Cell-based specimen' is a synonym for cytologic material and does not add attributes. The specificity of site ensures this matches the concept rather than broader or method-defined variants.
467770002,"Cervical/intrauterine brachytherapy system applicator, manual (physical object)",Equipment listing: manual cervical/intrauterine brachytherapy system applicator,This inventory-style entry names a manual brachytherapy system applicator for cervical/intrauterine use. It is purely a device designation without additional attributes like placement or compatibility. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). SCTID 467770002 is the precise code because it integrates both the anatomical target (cervical/intrauterine) and manual device type. Parent or sibling device concepts would either be too general or specify different sites or power characteristics. The phrasing reflects the same concept as the preferred term in a different documentation context.
41990003,Mannosyl-glycoprotein endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (substance),Substance: mannosyl-glycoprotein endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase,"The entry announces the semantic type explicitly as a substance and then names the same enzyme. Category: Substance. The context word 'Substance' does not create a product or procedural concept; it anchors the item as the chemical/biologic entity. Absence of variant letters, brand, or dose favors the precise code 41990003 over broader or more specific alternatives."
103190009,Acetylcholine receptor binding antibody (substance),Substance: acetylcholine receptor binding antibody,"This is a substance designation for the acetylcholine receptor binding antibody, aligning with SNOMED CT concept 103190009 in the Substance hierarchy. It neither implies testing nor findings, so observable or procedure codes would be inappropriate. The binding descriptor provides specificity beyond a generic AChR antibody and excludes other subclasses like blocking or modulating antibodies."
1285444002,Gastric emptying breath test (procedure),Gastric emptying breath test,"The entry names the procedure explicitly: a breath test used to assess gastric emptying. The main concept is a diagnostic procedure utilizing breath sampling to evaluate gastric emptying. No additional attributes (e.g., cause, timing, severity, modality other than breath) are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The precise match is Gastric emptying breath test (SCTID: 1285444002), since the wording specifies both the target (gastric emptying) and the method (breath test). Broader parents such as generic gastric emptying tests, or siblings like gastric emptying scintigraphy, are less appropriate because they do not specify the breath-based methodology. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not change the code selection."
272094003,Unit of electrical measurement (qualifier value),Unit for electrical measurement,"The wording indicates a unit intended for measuring electrical quantities without identifying any particular electrical parameter. As a Qualifier value, SNOMED CT 272094003 captures exactly this general unit category. Parent concepts would be overly broad, while child or sibling concepts (e.g., voltage unit, current unit) are not warranted because the statement remains general across electrical measurements."
411758006,Pimpinella anisum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen product: Pimpinella anisum extract,"The phrase states a diagnostic allergen product and clarifies the extract source as Pimpinella anisum, without specifying administration or test modality. The concept is a Product (pharmaceutical/biologic product) — diagnostic allergen extract. It maps to SCTID 411758006 since it denotes the anise diagnostic allergen extract. Choosing a parent diagnostic allergen concept would omit the species; selecting a child that constrains to specific testing forms would add attributes not included. Therapeutic allergen product siblings are inappropriate because the entry is diagnostic in intent."
1843201000004100,Gleason scoring system for prostatic cancer by largest nodule (staging scale),Scale in use: Gleason scoring by largest tumor nodule (prostate cancer),"This indicates that the scale in use is Gleason scoring by largest tumor nodule for prostate cancer, directly matching the staging scale concept provided. It refers to the scale selection, not the outcome, making it an Assessment/Staging scale (Qualifier value). The “largest tumor nodule” phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym for “largest nodule,” maintaining concept specificity. This avoids broader parent Gleason scales and excludes sibling patient-specific results such as numerical Gleason scores or grade groups."
719470001,Typhoid vaccination contraindicated (situation),Travel medicine chart: typhoid inoculation contraindicated,"This records that typhoid inoculation is contraindicated, with a travel medicine chart context and no extra attributes. It is a SNOMED CT Situation. The exact match is 719470001 Typhoid vaccination contraindicated (situation), with “inoculation” being a clinically equivalent synonym for vaccination. Parent concepts lacking the typhoid specificity and sibling concepts for other vaccines or different contexts (e.g., deferred) would be less appropriate."
1284937005,World Health Organization grading system for urothelial carcinoma (staging scale),Diagnostic report references the WHO urothelial carcinoma grading system,"The entry notes that a diagnostic (pathology) report references the WHO grading system for urothelial carcinoma, indicating the application of a staging/assessment scale. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale (assessment scale). SCTID 1284937005 is the most precise concept for this reference; broader WHO grading concepts or different systems would be inappropriate. This paraphrase is clinically equivalent and avoids adding grade, timing, or etiologic attributes."
224311000,Attending higher education college (finding),Education status: attending higher education college,"The phrase explicitly ties the finding to education status and specifies higher education college attendance. As a Clinical finding, this maps precisely to 224311000. The specificity excludes parent concepts that are too general and sibling concepts referring to different institutions. The wording is a direct equivalent to the preferred term and maintains codable precision."
257629009,Hotel (environment),Imaging report context: patient located in a hotel,"This denotes the patient's location as a hotel in the context of an imaging report, maintaining the environmental focus. The SNOMED CT category is Environment and the exact match is Hotel (environment), SCTID 257629009. It does not introduce a different facility type or hotel sublocation, so parent or child concepts remain less appropriate. The contextual phrasing does not alter code selection."
773997009,Custom-made pressure-management insole (physical object),Custom-molded pressure-management insole,"This phrase identifies a single insole that is custom-molded (a custom-made method) and intended for pressure management, with no new attributes such as laterality or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. “Custom-molded” is a common synonym indicating custom fabrication; combined with “pressure-management,” it maps precisely to Custom-made pressure-management insole (773997009). More generic parent objects would omit customization, while siblings like arch-support or prefabricated insoles do not fit the stated device."
255545003,Definite (qualifier value),Handoff note—certainty indicator: definite,"This handoff note records the certainty indicator as “definite,” a pure qualifier value. It should be coded as SNOMED CT 255545003 Definite (qualifier value), within the Qualifier value category. Parent concepts representing the certainty scale are less specific, and sibling values (probable, possible, suspected, confirmed) are not expressed here. The entry does not introduce any condition or other attributes; it strictly communicates the certainty qualifier."
428607008,No known environmental allergy (situation),Environmental allergen allergy: none.,"This allergen-category phrasing records that the patient has no allergy to environmental allergens. The main concept is a negated environmental allergy status, belonging to Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT 428607008 precisely matches this documentation. It is more specific than general 'no known allergy' and does not stray into drug or food allergy domains. The wording is a safe, equivalent paraphrase that does not add extra attributes."
423016009,Clinical statement entry (record artifact),Clinical statement entry,"The phrase explicitly names the artifact type 'clinical statement entry,' which directly corresponds to SNOMED CT concept 423016009 and belongs to the Record artifact hierarchy. No additional attributes such as clinical content, timing, severity, or provenance are introduced. This is not a clinical note, report, or problem list item; it specifically identifies a single recorded statement entry. Therefore, the most precise match is Clinical statement entry (record artifact), rather than broader parent concepts like Record artifact or siblings such as Clinical note or Clinical document. The wording is a direct use of the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
257135005,DRB1*0303 (substance),Catalog nomenclature: DRB1*0303,"The entry presents DRB1*0303 as a catalog nomenclature term but conveys only the allele designation itself, with no additional product or result attributes. Main concept: DRB1*0303 allele substance. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It aligns with DRB1*0303 (substance), SCTID 257135005. Parent and sibling concepts are either broader or different alleles and thus less appropriate. The catalog context does not alter the substance identity, keeping code selection unchanged."
122581006,Erythrocyte specimen from blood donor (specimen),Specimen received: erythrocytes from blood donor,"This entry represents receipt of a specimen composed of erythrocytes with donor origin; it introduces no additional clinical attributes beyond material and source. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122581006 is the correct match because it encodes an erythrocyte specimen from a blood donor. A parent like “Erythrocyte specimen” lacks the donor qualifier, and sibling concepts describing other components or whole blood would not match the specified material. The phrasing does not imply a transfusion unit, so product codes are inappropriate. The use of “erythrocytes” aligns with red blood cells as synonyms, preserving the concept."
260400001,Reduced (qualifier value),Reading: reduced,"The phrase frames “reduced” as a qualitative reading, consistent with a decreased descriptor used to qualify observations. No additional attributes (severity, timing, cause) are present. The main concept is Reduced in the Qualifier value hierarchy. SCTID 260400001 matches this usage precisely. A parent qualifier category is overly broad, and siblings such as Increased or Normal would not align with the meaning. The contextual word “Reading:” does not affect the qualifier selection."
1380083009,Union for International Cancer Control aT2 (qualifier value),UICC aT2,"The entry states the autopsy-based T category 'aT2' under the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM system. This is a staging qualifier, not a diagnosis, so the appropriate SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 1380083009 specifically represents UICC aT2, making it the most precise match. More general or different-prefix siblings such as UICC T2 (unspecified), cT2, pT2, yT2, or rT2 would be less accurate because the wording explicitly conveys the autopsy prefix 'a'. The concise form 'UICC aT2' is a direct, clinically equivalent expression of the concept without introducing additional attributes."
366485000,Finding of range of shoulder internal rotation (finding),PT note: shoulder internal rotation range finding,"The entry denotes a physical therapy (PT) note documenting a finding of shoulder internal rotation range, consistent with SNOMED CT 366485000. The category is Clinical finding. The PT context adds documentation setting but no clinical modifiers (e.g., severity, laterality). It is narrower than parent shoulder ROM findings and does not suggest sibling motions or child-level statuses like limitation or improvement."
285679004,Explosive force (physical force),Explosive force noted in chart,"The entry documents that an explosive force is noted, maintaining focus on the physical force and avoiding added attributes like injury or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. The appropriate code is Explosive force (physical force) [285679004]. A parent (Physical force) would be overly broad, and siblings like Explosion (event) or Blast injury (disorder) would misrepresent the force as an occurrence or outcome. Documentation context does not affect code selection."
170622002,Oral steroids started (situation),Began taking oral steroids,"This conveys that the patient began (initiated) taking steroids by mouth, specifying the route and action of start with no extra attributes such as dosage or indication. It fits the Situation with explicit context and aligns with SCTID 170622002 Oral steroids started (situation). Parent concepts like Medication use started lack drug class specificity, and siblings for ongoing use (‘on steroids’) would miss the initiation aspect. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to ‘started oral steroids.’"
114946001,"Salmonella II 52:z44:1,5,7 (organism)","Salmonella II 52:z44:1,5,7 listed under organisms","This line places the exact taxon Salmonella II 52:z44:1,5,7 in an organisms list, keeping the focus on taxonomic identity. It is an Organism concept and aligns with SCTID 114946001. The contextual phrase 'listed under organisms' does not introduce clinical attributes. Parent taxa are overly broad and siblings differ in antigenic formula, so the specific serovar code is optimal. No disorder, specimen, or presence information is included."
214925009,"Motor vehicle nontraffic accident involving injury from moving part of motor vehicle while boarding or alighting from motor vehicle, except off-road motor vehicle, not on public highway (event)","Sliding van door movement caused injury while exiting in private car park (nontraffic event, not on highway)","A sliding van door is a moving part; the timing is exiting (alighting); the private car park confirms that it is nontraffic and not on a public highway. SNOMED CT category: Event. The entry corresponds to SCTID 214925009, which requires a motor vehicle nontraffic accident with injury from a moving part during boarding or alighting. Parent concepts do not include mechanism/timing; sibling codes suggesting highway involvement or off-road vehicles do not fit. “Exiting” is equivalent to alighting, ensuring semantic equivalence."
183983001,Heart operation planned (situation),Plan for cardiac surgery.,"The entry indicates an established plan to undertake cardiac (heart) surgery, with no extra details provided. This is categorized as a Situation. The appropriate code is 183983001 |Heart operation planned (situation)|, capturing the planned heart operation. Using a more general parent (e.g., Procedure planned) would miss the heart-specific context, while any child specifying the surgical subtype would add detail not present. 'Cardiac surgery' is a synonym of 'heart operation' and does not change code selection."
706014003,Endotherapy cannula (physical object),Endotherapy cannula noted among endoscopic accessories,"Main concept: identification of an endotherapy cannula as part of accessory equipment. Category: Physical object. Although described among accessories, the specific device named is the endotherapy cannula and should be coded to 706014003. Coding to a general 'endoscopic accessory' sibling would be less precise, and using a parent cannula concept would be too broad."
426446005,Agromyces ramosus (organism),Agromyces ramosus taxon,"‘Taxon’ denotes the taxonomic unit, and with the species name given, the reference is clearly to Agromyces ramosus at the species level. This corresponds to the SNOMED CT Organism concept 426446005. No clinical attributes or detection status are included, so using parent genus or disorder concepts would be less accurate."
1290132007,Ambient polluted air (environment),Ambient polluted air,"The main concept is ambient polluted air, with no added qualifiers beyond stating the environment. This belongs to the SNOMED CT semantic tag Environment. The wording matches exactly the environment description of ambient air that is polluted, making SCTID 1290132007 the most precise code. Broader parent concepts like ambient air without the pollution attribute, and sibling concepts such as exposure or findings related to air pollution, are less appropriate because this entry does not describe exposure or a clinical effect; it solely identifies the environmental condition."
411329006,Palladium chloride (product),Record entry: palladium chloride product,"A neutral record entry stating palladium chloride as a product keeps the concept within the Product category and avoids additional attributes (dose, form, role). Therefore, it maps precisely to Palladium chloride (product), SCTID 411329006. Broader parent product categories or more specific child products are not appropriate given the generic product wording."
442415003,Time of arrival of anesthesia care provider to anesthetizing location (observable entity),Documented time when anesthesia provider arrived at the anesthetizing site,"This phrase denotes the documented time of arrival of the anesthesia provider at the anesthetizing site, which is equivalent to SNOMED concept 442415003. Category: Observable entity. 'Site' serves as a synonym for 'location' in this context, and no additional attributes or different events are introduced. It remains distinct from related concepts like anesthesia start time or patient arrival time."
445584004,Report by finality status (record artifact),Report finality status tracking,"The phrase denotes tracking the finality status for a report as a recorded artifact, without naming a particular finality state. This corresponds to SNOMED CT 445584004, which categorizes reports by finality. Choosing a parent concept would lose the finality focus, and selecting child/sibling status-value concepts would be too specific. “Tracking” describes use of the same status field and does not alter the concept."
1285539006,Mobility of upper right limb (observable entity),Functional assessment item: right upper extremity mobility,"This entry frames mobility of the right upper extremity as an item within a functional assessment, mapping to the Observable entity “Mobility of upper right limb” (SCTID 1285539006). No impairment or normality is asserted, avoiding a Clinical finding classification. A parent without laterality is too general, and siblings like left upper limb mobility or joint-specific ROM would be inaccurate. The term “functional assessment” is context and does not change the attribute being captured."
58068001,"Experimental aircraft, device (physical object)",Experimental aircraft (physical object),"This phrasing specifies the physical object nature of the experimental aircraft, aligning directly with the SNOMED CT concept. The category is Physical object. The inclusion of 'experimental' prevents mapping to broader parents such as Aircraft, device, and no additional attributes are introduced to suggest a child or sibling. SCTID 58068001 is the most precise match."
386662004,Pedal cycle accident (event),Mechanism: pedal cycle accident,"This statement documents the mechanism as a pedal cycle accident, which matches the Pedal cycle accident (event) concept. The SNOMED CT category is Event. No extra attributes (traffic, collision partner, injury severity, time) are included, so a more specific child would be inappropriate. A broader parent like Transport accident would omit the pedal cycle specificity. The wording is directly equivalent to the preferred term, warranting SCTID 386662004."
263845008,Premenstrual (qualifier value),Pattern is premenstrual,"The wording describes a temporal pattern that is specifically before menstruation, without adding details of severity or etiology. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It maps to 263845008 because 'premenstrual' is the sole qualifier; terms like 'perimenstrual' or 'postmenstrual' are different timings and would be incorrect."
63338004,Drug flavoring (product),Include drug flavoring,"This directive implies use of the product drug flavoring in a medication context. The concept is a pharmaceutical Product, and Drug flavoring (product) SCTID 63338004 is the best match. The statement does not introduce details such as specific flavor or formulation, so no child concept is indicated, nor does it suggest a different excipient class. It remains a precise reference to the flavoring product used in drugs."
309075001,Skin cyst specimen (specimen),Specimen identifier: skin cyst,"The entry records the specimen identifier as 'skin cyst,' denoting a specimen from a skin cyst and not, for example, a disorder diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. 309075001 is the correct code, as it captures the specimen source, with no added attributes like subtype or method. Using 'cyst specimen' or 'skin specimen' would be less exact; specifying fluid or wall would over-constrain. The labeling format is consistent with specimen coding."
35125005,Increased torsion (finding),Documented increased torsion,"This indicates that the finding of increased torsion has been recorded, without introducing site, severity, cause, or timing. The main concept is increased torsion, a Clinical finding, mapping to Increased torsion (finding) [35125005]. General abnormal torsion parents lack directional specificity, and children detailing location are not supported by the text. The documentation context does not alter the clinical meaning."
167221003,Urinalysis = no abnormality (finding),Patient reports urinalysis was normal.,"Although presented as a patient-reported statement, the core clinical content is that the urinalysis showed no abnormality, a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 167221003 “Urinalysis = no abnormality” remains the most precise code. Mapping to a parent like generic normal test result would lose specificity, and siblings focusing on different urine tests (e.g., culture) would not match. The reporting context does not change the medical concept; “normal” still equates to no abnormality."
411604008,Pigeon feathers diagnostic allergen extract (product),Pigeon feathers diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry explicitly names a diagnostic allergen extract prepared from pigeon feathers, which matches the SNOMED CT product concept 411604008. The main concept is a product used for allergy diagnosis; there are no added attributes beyond its diagnostic use and its source allergen (pigeon feathers). Category: Product. This is more precise than a parent like generic bird feather allergen extracts and does not drift to a sibling such as therapeutic allergen extracts. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not alter code selection."
161675005,History of artificial eyeglobe (situation),Anamnesis: history of artificial eye,"Anamnesis denotes historical data; 'history of artificial eye' corresponds to 'History of artificial eyeglobe' (SCTID 161675005), a Situation with explicit context. 'Artificial eye' is a standard synonym. There are no additional attributes, so broader 'history of device' or sibling 'prosthesis present' concepts would be less specific and thus less appropriate."
420741007,Pectobacterium cacticida (organism),Patient-reported term: Pectobacterium cacticida,"The entry presents the organism name as reported by a patient with no clinical qualifiers. Main concept: the species Pectobacterium cacticida. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This maps cleanly to SCTID 420741007; using a broader or different concept would reduce specificity. The wording adds no attributes like infection, detection, or strain."
15533005,Genus Lemmus (organism),Taxon name: Lemmus (genus),"This labels Lemmus as a taxon name at genus rank, avoiding any species qualifiers. SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 15533005 is the most precise match. Species-specific children like Lemmus lemmus are not supported by the text, and higher-level taxa would be overly general. The phrasing is a synonymic representation of the genus concept."
439462006,Genus Sporolactobacillus (organism),Reported genus: Sporolactobacillus,"The term identifies the reported genus as Sporolactobacillus and introduces no species, site, or clinical attributes. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Organism hierarchy and maps to Genus Sporolactobacillus (SCTID 439462006). More general parents (e.g., bacteria) or sibling genera would be inaccurate, and child species would be too detailed. The entry is a clear genus-level synonym without changing code selection."
361781006,Entire trapezoid bone (body structure),Entire trapezoid bone structure,"By including 'entire' with 'trapezoid bone structure,' the entry clearly targets the whole trapezoid bone, not any substructure. The category is Body structure. This aligns with 361781006. A mapping to 'Structure of trapezoid bone' (parent) would be less precise because that includes parts, whereas 'entire' constrains the scope to the whole bone. No sibling or child concept is suggested."
184216000,Patient record type (record artifact),Patient record type (EHR metadata),"This entry identifies the 'patient record type' and notes it as part of EHR metadata, which is a contextual description of where the attribute resides. The underlying concept remains the classification of a patient's record, which is a Record artifact in SNOMED CT, precisely SCTID 184216000. No additional attributes or specific type values are provided, so child concepts are not appropriate, and siblings like 'clinical document type' are not referenced. The parent category would be overly general compared to the patient record focus."
216929001,Failure of sterile precautions during infusion (event),Failure of sterile precautions during infusion,"The documented concept is a failure of sterile precautions occurring in the context of an infusion. This explicitly names the procedural context (infusion) and the event (failure of sterility). SNOMED CT category: Event. This wording aligns exactly with the FSN and SCTID 216929001, making it the most precise match. More general parent concepts such as a generic failure of sterile precautions would be less specific, and sibling concepts referring to other procedures (e.g., during injection or catheter insertion) are not indicated. No additional attributes (cause, severity, timing, associated conditions) are introduced."
420489004,Family Oxyopidae (organism),Taxonomic family: Oxyopidae,"This entry states the taxonomic rank and the family name, which corresponds to an Organism concept. SCTID 420489004 is the precise match since it represents the family Oxyopidae. Choosing a parent (such as Araneae) would omit the declared family-level detail, and selecting a child (e.g., genus Oxyopes) would exceed the scope. The language is strictly taxonomic, with no added clinical attributes, ensuring correct coding."
1306620002,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with lips closed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),"Facial record artifact: extraoral photo of right half-face, lips closed, CR.","The item is a facial record artifact: an extraoral photo of the right half of the face with lips closed and the jaw in CR (centric relation). The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. 'Half-face' and 'CR' are clinically equivalent terms that do not modify attributes. This matches SCTID 1306620002, excluding parents (too general) and siblings (left side, full face, open lips, different occlusal relation)."
294393009,Allergy to hydroxychloroquine (finding),Hydroxychloroquine hypersensitivity (allergy),"This explicitly equates hypersensitivity with allergy for hydroxychloroquine, a clinically standard synonym indicating immunologic response. Without adding attributes, it is a Clinical finding and maps to Allergy to hydroxychloroquine (finding), SCTID 294393009. Generic hypersensitivity or different-agent allergies are less precise, and adverse reaction terminology would be inappropriate for an immunologic allergy."
713776001,Email encounter from third party (procedure),Provider inbox: third-party email encounter logged,"This entry situates the event in provider inbox documentation, but the core concept remains an email encounter from a third party. The main attributes are the email modality and third-party origin; it is a Procedure in SNOMED CT matched by 'Email encounter from third party' (713776001). Context of where it was logged does not introduce new clinical attributes or change the communication type. Thus, parent or sibling concepts are less precise than the specified code."
701627004,Multi-purpose digital medical camera (physical object),Medical-grade multipurpose digital camera,"“Medical-grade” is a safe synonym for “medical,” preserving the device’s intended healthcare use, with digital and multipurpose specified. Category: Physical object (Device). The entry corresponds to SNOMED CT 701627004. More general parents (e.g., digital medical camera without scope) are less precise, and specialty camera siblings are not indicated. No additional clinical attributes beyond the device’s nature are added."
56469005,Moving a patient (procedure),Post-op: patient was moved,"This indicates the patient was moved following surgery but includes no additional attributes regarding how or where. The main concept is the procedural act of moving a patient. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It cleanly maps to 56469005. It avoids implying transfer, transport, repositioning, turning, or lifting, which would require explicit detail. The postoperative context is non-determinant for coding and maintains the same concept."
713665009,Discussion about advance care planning with family member (situation),I talked with my family member about advance care planning.,"This patient-reported statement indicates a discussion about ACP and that it involved a family member, which aligns with the Situation of ACP discussion with family. SCTID 713665009 exactly represents this scenario. Sibling concepts focusing on other participants (e.g., clinician-only, patient-only) or narrower topics (specific directives) would be mismatched. The sentence stays within the discussion context without adding timing, outcomes, or other attributes."
736372004,Discharge care plan (record artifact),Discharge care plan completed,"The phrase indicates completion status of the discharge care plan document. The core concept remains the discharge care plan artifact; no extra care details, destinations, or clinical attributes are added. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The exact match is Discharge care plan (record artifact) [736372004]. Parent Care plan (record artifact) lacks the discharge context, while siblings like Discharge summary or Discharge instructions are different document types. The wording does not describe the procedure of discharge planning; it refers to the artifact being completed. Thus, the chosen concept and code are the most specific and accurate mapping."
413925000,Corynebacterium auris (organism),Bacterial species identified—Corynebacterium auris,"The phrase identifies the bacterial species by name, Corynebacterium auris, without adding clinical attributes such as positivity, site, or pathogenicity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. 'Identified' here simply reflects naming in a diagnostic taxonomy context and does not shift the meaning to a clinical finding. A parent concept (Corynebacterium) or broader bacterium categories would be insufficiently specific, and any sibling species would contradict the explicit species name."
1821000,Chemoreceptor apnea (finding),Chemoreceptor-mediated cessation of respiration (apnea),"This statement equates cessation of respiration to apnea and specifies chemoreceptor mediation, matching the concept’s mechanism. It is a Clinical finding appropriately coded as Chemoreceptor apnea (finding), SCTID 1821000. General apnea codes would miss the mechanistic detail, and other subtypes are not implied. The synonymy between 'cessation of respiration' and 'apnea' is clinically standard and does not change the intended concept."
736306002,Structure of soft tissue of digit of left hand (body structure),Left hand digit soft tissue,"This phrasing conveys the same anatomical structure: soft tissue associated with a digit of the left hand. It includes soft tissue, digit, and left hand, which are the necessary attributes of the Body structure concept. It does not select a specific digit (finger vs thumb), avoiding an overly narrow sibling concept. It is more specific than parent concepts that lack laterality or include non-digital hand soft tissues. Therefore, the most precise SNOMED match is 736306002."
223889007,Lincolnshire (geographic location),Address county: Lincolnshire,"The entry indicates that the county part of an address is Lincolnshire, which still denotes the same geographic entity. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Environment). The most accurate code is 223889007 Lincolnshire (geographic location). It avoids broader parent locations (England, UK) and narrower localities (e.g., Boston, Gainsborough) that would require different codes. The field label 'Address county' is contextual metadata and does not alter the place concept."
284178002,Stone quarry (environment),Stone extraction quarry,"This entry describes a quarry where stone is extracted, a standard synonym for a stone quarry environment. The main concept is the stone quarry as the environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 284178002 is exact. Broader quarry concepts lack material specificity, and alternate environments (mines, sandpits) are not indicated. ""Extraction"" describes inherent quarry purpose and does not introduce new attributes or affect code selection."
424239000,Forpus coelestis (organism),Confirmed organism: Forpus coelestis,"The statement confirms the organism species as Forpus coelestis; ‘confirmed’ is a documentation context that does not introduce additional attributes affecting coding. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 424239000 is the exact code for Forpus coelestis. A parent concept (genus or broader bird group) would be insufficiently specific, and sibling species would not match the named taxon. The phrase cleanly maps to the species-level concept without ambiguity."
48354008,Nosema lophi (organism),N. lophi,"This entry uses the standard abbreviated binomial (N. for Nosema) paired with the species epithet lophi, which is an accepted synonymic shorthand for the same organism. Category: Organism. The abbreviation does not introduce clinical attributes; it still references the specific species and not the genus alone, so SCTID 48354008 is the correct organism code. Coding to a parent like Nosema (organism) would be too general, and coding to another Nosema species would be incorrect. No presence or infection is implied."
44621000087101,Klebsiella oxytoca or Raoultella species (finding),Identified organism is Klebsiella oxytoca/Raoultella species,"This entry specifies that the identified organism is either Klebsiella oxytoca or a Raoultella species, without introducing site, timing, or clinical condition attributes, making it a Clinical finding. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 44621000087101. Parent concepts (e.g., non-specific bacterial identification) are less precise, while child concepts that name only Klebsiella oxytoca or only Raoultella are more specific than the entry allows. Using “identified organism” is a standard synonym for detected/present and does not change code selection."
102461004,Increased intolerance (finding),Greater intolerance,"‘Greater intolerance’ communicates that intolerance is increased in degree without specifying what it is directed toward. This is a Clinical finding best represented by Increased intolerance (finding). Parent concepts like Intolerance (finding) lack the magnitude change, while concepts that name specific intolerances (e.g., to drugs, foods, environments) are not supported by the entry, confirming 102461004 as the correct code."
247764002,Easily distracted (finding),Attention is easily distracted,"The statement frames attention as readily being distracted, capturing the core Clinical finding. It best matches SNOMED CT 247764002 Easily distracted (finding). There are no added attributes like severity or cause. Alternative codes for concentration problems or inattention would be less exact because the focus here is on distractibility rather than sustained attention per se."
768599000,Product containing peptide (product),Drug product containing peptide,"This entry states a drug product and constrains its ingredient class to peptide, which is the defining attribute of the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It best matches SCTID 768599000 because it reflects the ingredient-based product grouping. Parent classes like drug product without ingredient specification are broader, and children naming specific peptides (e.g., insulin-containing product) would not be supported by the text. No additional attributes are present."
258466008,Middle ear fluid specimen (specimen),Source: middle ear fluid (specimen),"This phrasing documents the specimen source as middle ear fluid and explicitly identifies it as a specimen. It avoids adding collection method, laterality, timing, or conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and Middle ear fluid specimen (SCTID: 258466008) is the most exact match. It is more precise than parent concepts like Ear specimen and does not imply child concepts that describe how the specimen was obtained. The synonym is clinically equivalent and supports the same coding."
130463008,Cortisol sulfotransferase (substance),Cortisol sulfotransferase enzyme,"The wording explicitly calls it an enzyme, which is correct for sulfotransferases and remains a substance designation. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 130463008 maps exactly to the cortisol-specific sulfotransferase enzyme. Parent concepts such as “enzyme” or “sulfotransferase” are too broad, and children specifying isoforms (e.g., particular SULT isoenzymes) are not stated and would be too narrow. No additional attributes are introduced."
22131000087102,Electronic report (record artifact),Report recorded electronically,"The entry identifies a report artifact and specifies that it is recorded in electronic form, with no added subtype or clinical attributes. The SNOMED category is Record artifact. It aligns with Electronic report (record artifact) [22131000087102]; using the parent Report would be less specific, and child concepts are not triggered because no domain is named. It explicitly excludes paper or hardcopy siblings."
309193002,Pharyngeal biopsy specimen (specimen),Pharyngeal biopsy specimen,"The main concept is a specimen obtained by biopsy from the pharynx, explicitly captured by the phrase “Pharyngeal biopsy specimen.” This fits the SNOMED CT category Specimen. The wording matches SCTID 309193002 exactly, specifying both the anatomic site (pharynx) and the specimen type (biopsy). Broader parent concepts like “Biopsy specimen” or “Pharyngeal specimen” are less precise because they omit either the site or the method. Child or sibling concepts such as “Oropharyngeal biopsy specimen,” “Nasopharyngeal biopsy specimen,” or “Hypopharyngeal biopsy specimen” would add subsite specificity not stated here and thus are inappropriate. No additional attributes (technique variant, fixative, timing, laterality) are introduced, making this an exact match."
217253009,Burning caused by conflagration in mobile home (event),Burning resulting from a mobile home conflagration,"This describes an event where burning results from a conflagration in a mobile home, fitting the SNOMED CT Event concept 217253009. The causal phrase 'resulting from' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of 'caused by' and does not introduce new attributes. Concepts that omit the mobile home context or that represent injury diagnoses (burn disorders) would be less precise or incorrect given the wording."
328668001,Gluten-free white sliced bread (product),Gluten free white sliced bread,"This entry is a spelling variant (without hyphen) of gluten-free white sliced bread, still specifying the product with attributes gluten-free, white, and sliced. It is a SNOMED CT Product and matches SCTID 328668001 precisely. Broader or different concepts (e.g., simply 'white bread,' 'sliced bread,' or 'gluten-free bread') fail to capture all three features simultaneously. The entry introduces no extras like quantity, brand, or preparation, so the exact product concept is preserved."
408949005,Finding related to pain control behavior (finding),Behavior aimed at controlling pain identified.,"The entry identifies behavior whose purpose is to control pain, which is clinically equivalent to pain control behavior. This is a Clinical finding and best maps to 408949005. It excludes particular techniques, severity, or temporal attributes, keeping it at the correct level of generality. It is not a procedure or a general pain behavior observation unrelated to control."
428550008,T wave alternans (observable entity),ECG morphology: T-wave alternans,"Main concept: T-wave alternans as an ECG morphological phenomenon; no extra qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. This targets the specific observable entity encoded by SCTID 428550008. Parent concepts (general ECG morphology abnormality) and siblings (electrical alternans) would be less precise or different. No microvolt testing or positiveness/negativeness is implied, so child/result concepts are not correct."
373613000,Cleans own needles (finding),Patient statement: I clean my own needles.,"A first-person patient statement directly conveys the finding that the patient cleans their own needles, without method, timing, or frequency detail. This is a Clinical finding and matches “Cleans own needles (finding)” SCTID 373613000. A parent concept would generalize needle cleaning without the ownership constraint, and siblings adding other ownership or cleanliness statuses are not implicated. The synonym ‘I clean my own needles’ is exact and clinically equivalent."
773450002,Liaison psychiatry care plan (record artifact),Plan of care—liaison psychiatry,"This entry expresses a plan of care and identifies the authoring domain as liaison psychiatry. 'Plan of care' is a standard synonym for care plan and does not introduce new attributes. Category: Record artifact. The liaison qualifier makes Liaison psychiatry care plan (773450002) the precise match. A generic Plan of care or Psychiatry plan would lose the liaison specificity, and procedural or service concepts (e.g., liaison psychiatry consultation) would not represent a record artifact."
473064002,History of malignant neoplasm of larynx (situation),Preoperative evaluation: history of carcinoma of the larynx,"This preoperative note records a history of laryngeal carcinoma, i.e., past malignant neoplasm of the larynx. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 473064002 is exact for this historical context. Active disorder concepts or more granular subsites/histologies are not stated. 'Carcinoma of the larynx' is a clinically equivalent phrasing that does not alter code selection."
180256009,Subcutaneous immunotherapy (procedure),SCIT (subcutaneous immunotherapy),"SCIT is the standard acronym for subcutaneous immunotherapy and is clinically equivalent to the preferred term. This is a Procedure and maps directly to 180256009. Using the acronym does not broaden the scope or alter attributes; it retains the route and nature of the therapy. Parent concepts like general immunotherapy lack route specificity, while sibling concepts describe different delivery methods and would not match the explicit subcutaneous modality indicated by SCIT."
422427007,Ixobrychus exilis (organism),Zoological species referenced: Ixobrychus exilis,"The referenced zoological species is Ixobrychus exilis. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The explicit species designation maps directly to 422427007 Ixobrychus exilis (organism), avoiding broader taxa like Ardeidae or generic ‘bittern,’ and excluding sibling species in the genus. The phrase does not introduce additional attributes; it strictly names the organism."
285686007,Low temperature (physical force),Cold ambient temperature (physical force),"The main concept is low (cold) temperature in ambient conditions, explicitly treated as a physical force. Category: Physical force. 'Cold' is a clinically safe synonym for 'low' when applied to temperature here. The wording avoids implying patient symptoms or exposure events, making 285686007 the most accurate code rather than any clinical finding or event subtype."
472897009,Swab from hip region (specimen),Specimen type: hip region swab,"This entry describes the specimen type as a hip region swab, indicating swab as the specimen and hip region as the source site. The concept belongs to the Specimen category. SNOMED CT 472897009 precisely represents a swab from the hip region. Parent concepts without an anatomical qualifier are too broad, and siblings/children like skin or joint swabs would introduce tissue/joint specifics not present here. The phrasing is a documentation variant and remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
734889003,Structure of right posterior tibial nerve (body structure),Patient summary mentions the right posterior tibial nerve,"This summary statement mentions the anatomical structure: the right posterior tibial nerve. The category is Body structure, and the most precise coding is SNOMED CT 734889003. No extra attributes such as symptoms, disorders, or branch-level specifics are included. Parent non-lateralized concepts and sibling left-sided concepts do not match the explicit right-sided nerve structure."
46942006,Oxamic acid (substance),Oxamic acid,"The entry names the specific chemical substance oxamic acid without any additional qualifiers or roles. The main medical concept is the substance itself. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The most precise match is Oxamic acid (substance) because the wording points to the exact chemical entity and not to an event, product, or measurement. Broader parent concepts like generic chemical substances or organic acids are too nonspecific, and sibling or child concepts such as oxalic acid, oxamide, or oxamate salts would be incorrect as they denote different chemicals. No attributes (dose, route, exposure, salt form, or product) are introduced."
82731005,Partial excision of bone of proximal humerus (procedure),Patient report: they removed part of the bone in my proximal humerus,"The patient’s phrasing indicates partial removal (excision) of bone at the proximal humerus without adding laterality or cause. Attributes: excision (removed), partial extent (part of bone), site proximal humerus bone. Category: Procedure. SCTID 82731005 matches precisely. A parent concept without partial extent would be less specific, and siblings with different sites or total removal would not fit. The paraphrase uses lay language equivalent to partial bone excision and does not change the coded concept."
1354798001,Fragrance mix II (product),Label reads: Fragrance mix II,"A labeling context is provided while the core concept is the product name “Fragrance mix II,” aligning with SNOMED CT Product concept 1354798001. The entry introduces no additional attributes such as composition details, dosing, or use. The “II” qualifier guarantees specificity and avoids mapping to broader or alternate fragrance mixes, keeping this uniquely codable to the intended product category."
161563007,History of chronic skin ulcer (situation),Documented past chronic skin ulcer,"The wording “documented past” conveys historical presence, and “chronic skin ulcer” identifies the specific condition. This aligns with a Situation with explicit context, mapping to SNOMED CT 161563007 History of chronic skin ulcer. It should not map to the active disorder Chronic ulcer of skin, as the entry emphasizes past status. Nor should it map to History of skin ulcer without chronic, as that would drop the chronic attribute. No additional attributes are introduced."
301440006,Ability to perform education and training activities (observable entity),Observed variable — ability to perform education and training activities,"The entry labels the ability to perform education and training activities as the observed variable, without conveying any measurement outcome or modifiers. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 301440006 precisely matches the observable in question. Parent concepts of general ability are too broad, and child/sibling concepts limited to single domains or learning ability diverge from the combined activity scope. The wording clarifies context without altering the concept."
432139004,Specimen from brain obtained by biopsy (specimen),Neurosurgery: brain biopsy specimen submitted,"The entry documents submission of a specimen, identifies 'brain' as the source, and clarifies it was obtained by 'biopsy.' This aligns with the Specimen hierarchy. The most precise SNOMED CT code is 432139004, which encodes a brain specimen taken by biopsy. Parent concepts lacking the biopsy attribute or sibling concepts specifying different procurement (e.g., excision) would be less accurate. Mentioning submission is context, not an attribute of the specimen, so it does not alter code selection."
3381000181101,Increased gene product function (qualifier value),Increased gene product function,"The entry states the functional change attribute of a gene product as increased, which corresponds directly to the qualifier value concept of increased gene product function. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 3381000181101 is the most precise match because it encodes the specific functional consequence (increased function) without implying a disease, variant type, or expression-level change. Parent or sibling concepts such as decreased gene product function, absent gene product function, or increased gene expression would be inappropriate because the wording is strictly about functional gain, not loss, absence, or expression. No additional attributes are introduced."
255494001,Right half field (qualifier value),Select the right half of the field,"The verb 'Select' indicates operational context but does not alter the qualifier; it still specifies the right half of a field. Category: Qualifier value. The most precise SNOMED concept is 255494001 Right half field. Less specific or left-sided alternatives would not match. The wording avoids domain specificity and other clinical attributes, keeping the entry uniquely codable to this qualifier."
407490004,Simian parainfluenza virus 5 (organism),Isolate: Simian parainfluenza virus 5,"This entry labels the isolate as Simian parainfluenza virus 5, conveying only the organism identity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism; code 407490004 specifically represents this virus. Parent concepts like generic parainfluenza virus are less precise, and siblings (e.g., other parainfluenza serotypes) are not correct. No additional attributes (cause, severity, host, timing) are introduced, so it does not align better with infection or detection findings and remains most appropriately coded as the organism."
223997004,Caicos island (geographic location),"Note text includes ""Caicos island""","Main concept: the phrase 'Caicos island' occurs in documentation, indicating the geographic location without added attributes. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. This directly maps to Caicos island (geographic location), SCTID 223997004. Coding to the parent 'Island' would be imprecise, and coding to any named Caicos island would not match the wording. Archipelago-level concepts (e.g., Turks and Caicos Islands) are broader and not stated. The mention within note text is contextual only and does not alter code selection."
224819005,Pedestrian underpass (environment),Pedestrian underpass walkway,"The entry conveys a pedestrian underpass by referring to the walkway component, which remains within the same environment concept. The main concept is the under-road pedestrian passage; no added attributes like timing or associated conditions are present. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This maps most precisely to 224819005 because 'walkway' indicates a path specifically for pedestrians within an underpass. A parent such as 'Underpass (environment)' lacks the pedestrian designation, while siblings like 'Sidewalk (environment)' or 'Pedestrian overpass' describe different structures. The synonym 'walkway' is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
224906007,Third floor (environment),Seen on the third floor,"The phrase conveys that the relevant location is the third floor; the primary concept is the environmental level and no additional attributes like department or building type are added. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224906007 precisely matches the specified ordinal and environment; using a parent concept would lose specificity, and sibling floors would not reflect 'third'. The contextual wording does not alter the semantic equivalence to 'third floor'."
736377005,Maternity care plan (record artifact),Maternity plan of care,"This uses a clinically standard synonym 'plan of care' for 'care plan' while retaining the maternity context, and maps to Maternity care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736377005. Category: Record artifact. The synonym does not add attributes or change scope; it remains distinct from broader care plans and from narrower siblings such as Birth plan or Antenatal care plan."
297111008,Lack breathing circuit (physical object),Lack circuit (anesthesia breathing),"The parenthetical clarifies the device domain without changing the identity: a Lack circuit used for anesthesia breathing. The main concept is a named physical object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This maps directly to 297111008 because ‘Lack’ specifies the exact circuit type. More general breathing circuit terms would be less specific, and other named circuits are not referenced. The phrasing is a synonym rather than an attribute change."
364445008,Mediastinal feature (observable entity),Mediastinal feature referenced in study,"This entry indicates that a study referenced a mediastinal feature, meaning an observable characteristic tied to the mediastinum, without result or abnormality. The concept belongs to the Observable entity category and aligns with Mediastinal feature (observable entity), SCTID 364445008. It avoids codes for body structures and clinical findings and does not specify a narrower attribute like width or contour, making child concepts unsuitable. The study context is incidental and does not change the concept."
401816005,"Spring truss femoral, special single left (physical object)",Applied: left special single femoral spring truss,"The wording indicates a device application context but still uniquely names the device: a left special single femoral spring truss. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It corresponds exactly to SCTID 401816005 because the attributes (femoral location, spring truss type, special single variant, left laterality) are included. The action verb does not change the object classification. More general parent codes or alternate-laterality siblings would not fit the stated specification."
114386000,Salmonella Arapahoe (organism),S. Arapahoe,"This entry uses the standard microbiology abbreviation 'S.' for Salmonella and specifies 'Arapahoe,' the serovar name, thereby unambiguously referring to the Salmonella Arapahoe organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The abbreviation is a clinically accepted synonym that does not change the taxonomic meaning; it still targets SCTID 114386000. Using a parent like Salmonella (organism) would be too general, and referencing other serovars would be incorrect. No extra attributes are added, keeping the selection precise to the organism."
408403008,Patient held record (record artifact),Updated the record the patient holds,"This indicates an update action on a record that is held by the patient, thus identifying the artifact as a patient-held record. The text does not introduce format or content-specific attributes. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The exact concept is “Patient held record (record artifact)” 408403008. Parent categories are overly general, and child/sibling distinctions (e.g., electronic PHR, immunization booklet, provider-held chart) are not implied."
216378002,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, skating rink (environment)",Environment: skating rink (place of occurrence),"By explicitly identifying the environment/place-of-occurrence as a skating rink, the entry maps to Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, skating rink (216378002). The category is Environment. The parent is too broad, and the entry lacks details that would necessitate a child concept (e.g., ice vs. roller). No other location is implied, so sibling concepts are inappropriate."
44974002,Low humidity (physical force),Ambient humidity low,"Main concept: air humidity in the ambient environment is low. Attribute: ambient context, with level specified as low; no numbers, timing, or causation. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. SCTID 44974002 is the most specific match because it denotes low humidity as a physical force present in the environment. Parent concepts that only state Humidity are insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts describing high or normal humidity do not fit this statement. 'Ambient' does not change the code selection; it only situates the physical force in the environment."
346458003,Gluten-free pasta (product),Supply: gluten-free pasta,"Within a supply context, the item is still gluten-free pasta, corresponding to Gluten-free pasta (product), SCTID 346458003. Main concept: gluten-free pasta. SNOMED CT category: Product. The context does not alter product characteristics or add attributes such as shape, preparation, brand, or composition beyond the gluten-free property. General pasta would omit the gluten-free qualifier, and broader gluten-free food would be nonspecific. No sibling products are implied. The entry remains unambiguous for coding."
251896001,Breathlessness rating (staging scale),Shortness of breath rating staging scale,"The entry denotes a staging scale specifically for rating shortness of breath, which is clinically synonymous with breathlessness. There are no values, grades, or actions described, so it remains a reference to the scale concept. SNOMED CT category is an assessment/staging scale (Qualifier value) rather than a finding or procedure. SCTID 251896001 appropriately captures this generic breathlessness rating staging scale, while parent ‘staging scale’ would be too broad and child/sibling concepts (specific scale names or grade values) would be too narrow. The use of ‘shortness of breath’ as a synonym does not introduce new attributes and is clinically equivalent to breathlessness."
442547005,Number of alcohol units consumed on heaviest drinking day (observable entity),Number of units consumed on the day the patient drank the most,"This phrasing defines a count of alcohol units on the patient’s highest-consumption day, which is equivalent to the heaviest drinking day measure. It maps to SNOMED CT 442547005 as an Observable entity. No additional attributes like severity or timeframe are added, and it avoids sibling measures such as typical-day units or total weekly consumption. Therefore, using the specific observable for heaviest-day unit count is the most accurate code."
16214491000119107,Specimen from right lung obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure (specimen),"Right lung, FNA cytology sample","The entry specifies an FNA cytology sample from the right lung, which matches a specimen acquired by fine needle aspiration and includes laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The term “cytology sample” reflects the laboratory use of FNA material but does not add attributes beyond site and method. A parent lacking laterality is less precise, siblings with left lung or different techniques are incorrect, and child concepts with lobar detail are too specific. The phrasing is clinically equivalent to the target concept."
370098008,Structure of posterior wall of anal canal (body structure),Posterior wall of anal canal noted,"The word 'noted' adds documentation context without altering the anatomical target: the posterior wall of the anal canal. This is a Body structure concept and corresponds to Structure of posterior wall of anal canal (SCTID 370098008). Broader parents omit ‘posterior,’ and siblings like anterior or lateral walls are not indicated. No assessment of abnormality, layer, or condition is included, so the structure-level code remains the most precise choice."
98331000119100,Rotavirus vaccination given (situation),Rotavirus vaccine was given.,"The wording conveys that the rotavirus vaccine has been given, i.e., administered and completed, but it remains a documentation statement without specifying procedural details, dose, timing, or brand. It maps best to the Situation category in SNOMED CT: Rotavirus vaccination given (situation), SCTID 98331000119100. A procedure concept emphasizes performance details not present here. Generic parent concepts are too broad, and sibling statuses like due/not given would contradict 'was given.' This phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym for the situation 'vaccination given.'"
242421001,Fall into storm drain (event),Mechanism: fall into storm drain,"This entry documents the mechanism of the event as fall into a storm drain. Category: Event. The 'mechanism' label is contextual and does not alter the coded concept, which remains Fall into storm drain (event) SCTID 242421001. Choosing a parent fall concept would lose the specific location detail, and siblings involving other destinations would be incorrect."
88767009,Structure of middle phalanx of second toe (body structure),Middle phalanx of toe II,"Using Roman numeral 'II' to indicate the second toe, this entry names the middle phalanx and does not introduce any extra attribute. Category: Body structure. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is Structure of middle phalanx of second toe (SCTID 88767009). A parent like 'middle phalanx of toe' would be underspecified without the digit index, and siblings for other phalanx levels or other digits would not fit. The numeral-based synonym is clinically equivalent."
217456003,Jump from burning barn (event),Leaped off a barn on fire,"Using 'leaped off' and 'on fire' are synonymous paraphrases of 'jumped from' and 'burning', respectively. The event is a jump originating from a barn that is burning, which corresponds precisely to 'Jump from burning barn' (217456003), an Event concept. No additional qualifiers are included, so broader or injury-related concepts would be less appropriate."
230094004,Spicy food intake (observable entity),Intake of spicy meals,"This wording specifies intake of meals that are spicy, which is semantically equivalent to spicy food intake. No quantity, frequency, timing, or effects are included. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 230094004 fits best. Parent concepts are too general, and child/sibling concepts focused on specific ingredients or nutrients are not appropriate here. The synonym does not change the code selection."
224694004,Breakfast room (environment),Observed in the breakfast room,"This entry situates an observation within the breakfast room, but the only codable concept is the environmental location 'breakfast room.' Category: Environment. The correct SNOMED CT mapping is Breakfast room (environment), SCTID 224694004. Parent or sibling room concepts (Room, Dining room, Kitchen) do not capture the breakfast-specific designation. The verb ‘observed’ adds no clinical attributes to the location itself."
216384004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, vacation resort (environment)",Place of occurrence code: vacation resort property,"The entry assigns the place-of-occurrence as a vacation resort property, semantically equivalent to vacation resort, matching SNOMED CT 216384004. The main concept is the environment where accident/poisoning occurred; no additional attributes are present. The category is Environment. 'Resort property' does not imply a hotel/motel or campsite and remains within the resort setting, avoiding sibling concepts. Therefore, this code is the most precise match."
308376004,Police surgeon postmortem report (record artifact),Police surgeon postmortem report referenced,"This entry notes a reference to a police surgeon postmortem report, maintaining focus on the document itself. ‘Referenced’ is contextual and does not change the artifact type. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Since the author is specified as police surgeon, it does not map better to a parent generic postmortem/autopsy report or to sibling concepts like coroner reports. No added attributes are included, so SCTID 308376004 is the correct and most specific match."
388066009,Spinacia oleracea specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Specific IgE to spinach (Spinacia oleracea),"The phrase explicitly denotes an IgE antibody with specificity to Spinacia oleracea, i.e., spinach. This is a Substance concept and maps to SCTID 388066009. The wording avoids any attribute like levels or interpretation, focusing strictly on the antibody’s antigen specificity. Parent terms like generic food-specific IgE lack the spinach designation, and child component-level IgE (to individual spinach proteins) is not suggested. Therefore, this synonym is clinically equivalent and supports the exact concept selection."
223380002,Guernsey (geographic location),Guernsey (Channel Island),"This phrasing clarifies that Guernsey is one of the Channel Islands, but the coded concept should be Guernsey itself. The main concept is the geographic location. In SNOMED CT, Guernsey (geographic location) [223380002] under Location is the exact match. Coding to the broader Channel Islands would be too general, and no sublocalities of Guernsey are mentioned. The descriptor ‘Channel Island’ is contextual and does not change the selection."
306757005,Ability to produce voiceless sounds (observable entity),Follow-up item: ability to produce voiceless sounds,"The follow-up context does not alter the core concept, which is the observable capability to produce voiceless sounds. This is an Observable entity aligned to SCTID 306757005. No value state, cause, or extent is implied. A broader parent such as generic sound production ability is less specific, and siblings like voiced sound production ability do not match the voiceless constraint explicitly stated."
1269502008,Diagnosis section (record artifact),Diagnosis section within the report,"The entry identifies the part of a report labeled Diagnosis, describing a document section artifact rather than a medical finding. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, best coded as Diagnosis section (record artifact) SCTID 1269502008. No modifiers like final or differential are present, which would point to different concepts. Sibling sections (Impression, Conclusion) are not indicated, supporting selection of the specific diagnosis section."
711589001,Cochlear implant system connector (physical object),Equipment list entry—cochlear implant system connector,"This phrase lists the cochlear implant system connector as an equipment item, a Physical object. The context (equipment list) is neutral and does not add attributes such as condition or function beyond being the connector. Therefore, SCTID 711589001 is the correct, specific code. Using a broader device or a different implant part would be less accurate; the entry clearly targets the connector component within the cochlear implant system."
782220006,Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli serogroup O21 (organism),Pathogen identified: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O21,"This statement indicates identification of a pathogen that is Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, serogroup O21. The core concept remains the organism, placing it in the SNOMED CT Organism category. It maps to SCTID 782220006 by specifying both Shiga toxin production and the O21 serogroup. Referring to it as a 'pathogen' offers context but does not introduce additional attributes such as disease state or site. More general parents (e.g., STEC without serogroup or E. coli O21 without toxigenicity) and siblings representing other serogroups would be less precise."
315214003,Beta blocker not indicated (situation),Beta-blocking agent not indicated.,"The entry denotes that a beta-blocking agent (synonym for beta blocker) is not indicated. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. The synonym preserves the medication class identity, so the precise mapping is to Beta blocker not indicated (315214003). It does not imply contraindication or refusal and is more specific than a parent concept about general medication non-indication."
77105004,Garrotment (event),Narrative indicates garroting,"The narrative context states the occurrence of garroting, which directly corresponds to Garrotment (event), code 77105004. No further attributes (intent, timing, severity, or associated conditions) are introduced, keeping it within the Event category. Broader mechanisms like Strangulation (event) would under-specify the explicit garroting described here."
418780004,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Class I/Clean (finding),CDC/NNIS Class I — clean wound class.,"This entry references the CDC/NNIS system and specifies Class I as clean wound class, which is the established label for CDC Class I. The main concept is CDC Class I/Clean, categorized as a Clinical finding. SCTID 418780004 fits exactly. Using NNIS alongside CDC is a conventional synonym for the same CDC classification framework; it does not change the concept or add attributes. Parent general wound class concepts are less specific, and sibling classes (II–IV) are not indicated."
1362133002,Antenatal ultrasonography confirms multiple pregnancy (finding),Prenatal ultrasound documented a multiple pregnancy.,"The statement describes documentation of multiple pregnancy on prenatal ultrasound, constituting a Clinical finding. It matches SNOMED CT 1362133002 since the concept is confirmation of multiple gestation by antenatal ultrasonography. Using a parent concept would omit the documentation via ultrasound, and selecting a child concept would require specification of number or other attributes not in the entry. 'Prenatal' and 'antenatal' are synonymous, and no extra clinical details are introduced."
733056005,Fluid specimen from ear (specimen),Specimen type—ear fluid,"This lab-oriented phrasing designates the specimen type as fluid from the ear, with no additional qualifiers such as laterality or subsite. In SNOMED CT, the category is Specimen, and the specific concept is Fluid specimen from ear (733056005). Parent concepts lacking the fluid qualifier are less precise, and siblings that denote different materials (swab, tissue, cerumen) are not appropriate. The entry focuses on specimen type rather than a clinical finding, making 733056005 the best match."
708468007,Deoxyribonucleic acid of Trichophyton rubrum (substance),Lab component name: Trichophyton rubrum DNA,"This names a laboratory component as Trichophyton rubrum DNA, clearly identifying the substance without implying a result or procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise code is “Deoxyribonucleic acid of Trichophyton rubrum” (SCTID: 708468007). It avoids parents such as fungal DNA or Trichophyton genus DNA, and it is not a sibling like RNA or antigen of T. rubrum. The context of a lab component does not change the molecular identity, keeping the code selection exact."
782818001,Product containing potassium channel activator (product),EMR medication product containing potassium channel activator,"This entry points to a medication product documented in the EMR that contains a potassium channel activator. The main concept is product-level and does not specify administration events or clinical conditions. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 782818001 is the precise match for products containing this pharmacologic class. Parent generic product categories are less specific, and sibling substance concepts would be incorrect. No mention of dose, route, formulation, or exclusivity avoids child concepts. The EMR context is ancillary and does not alter the product-focused coding."
720121003,Immunoglobulin G antibody to Jamestown Canyon virus (substance),Antiviral IgG to Jamestown Canyon virus,The phrase indicates an IgG antibody with antiviral specificity to Jamestown Canyon virus; 'antiviral' here is descriptive of the target but introduces no new attributes like result or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Substance and SCTID 720121003 is the most accurate code. Using a general 'antibody to Jamestown Canyon virus' or an IgM counterpart would be less specific than this IgG-focused wording.
223365008,Canary islands (geographic location),The Canaries (archipelago),"“The Canaries (archipelago)” uses a common synonym for the Canary Islands and clarifies the geographic nature by including “archipelago,” ensuring the meaning is the island group. Category: Geographic location (Location). No timing, severity, or administrative attributes are added. This aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 223365008. It does not refer to individual islands (child concepts) or to any administrative entity (sibling), making the geographic location concept the most precise fit."
249419005,Gums bleed to touch (finding),Bleeding gums when touched.,"The content indicates that the gums bleed when they are touched, clearly identifying touch as the provoking stimulus, with no additional details such as cause or severity. This is a Clinical finding. The exact match is Gums bleed to touch (finding) [249419005]. Parent concepts of gingival bleeding lack the touch qualifier, and sibling concepts specifying probing or spontaneous bleeding would be incorrect here. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase and remains semantically equivalent without changing the code."
773445008,Gastrointestinal surgery care plan (record artifact),GI surgery care plan reviewed,"The wording confirms the presence of a GI surgery care plan and notes that it was reviewed, which is contextual and does not add attributes like timing or severity to the concept itself. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the precise code is Gastrointestinal surgery care plan (773445008). A general Surgical care plan is too broad, and a procedure concept for GI surgery would be inappropriate because this entry is about the plan artifact. The term “reviewed” reflects activity around the plan without changing its identity."
780836005,Target serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol level (observable entity),Discharge summary: serum HDL cholesterol target level,"The discharge summary entry denotes the target level for serum HDL cholesterol, corresponding to the observable entity 780836005. It is a goal value, not a report of a lab result. The wording is specific to HDL in serum and does not introduce other attributes, keeping it distinct from sibling lipid targets."
4201000179104,Imaging report (record artifact),Clinical imaging report,"This phrase denotes a clinical document reporting on imaging, which is a Record artifact. It precisely corresponds to Imaging report (record artifact) [4201000179104]. The entry does not specify modality or findings, making child/sibling concepts like CT report or MRI report inappropriate. Parent concepts like a general clinical report are less specific. The synonym is clinically standard and does not alter the intended code selection."
116379006,Legionella maceachernii (organism),Taxon recorded: Legionella maceachernii,"The entry reflects a taxonomic record focused on the species name. The main concept is the species Legionella maceachernii. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The code SCTID 116379006 matches the species. Parent genus-level concepts are not sufficiently specific, and sibling species would be inaccurate. The entry does not introduce clinical attributes (e.g., infection), keeping it squarely in the organism domain."
768769007,Product containing carbohydrate derivative (product),Medication product containing carbohydrate derivative,"This line denotes a medication product whose active ingredient class is a carbohydrate derivative, mapping to the SNOMED CT Product concept for such products. It introduces no extra attributes (no dose, route, brand, indication, or specific derivative), thus Product containing carbohydrate derivative (product) is the most precise. Broader parents would miss the ingredient class, and more specific children would name a particular derivative not mentioned. The synonym is clinically and semantically equivalent."
444766008,Colposcopy clinic (environment),Site of care: colposcopy clinic,"This phrase identifies the site of care as the colposcopy clinic. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It maps precisely to Colposcopy clinic (environment) [444766008]; 'site of care' is a neutral context descriptor and does not introduce new attributes such as inpatient/outpatient or specific services. Parent terms are too broad, and sibling sites (e.g., gynecology clinic) are not what is stated."
122636002,Specimen from proximal stomach obtained by partial gastrectomy (specimen),Path report header: partial gastrectomy—proximal stomach specimen,"A pathology report header stating partial gastrectomy and proximal stomach specimen captures the required attributes, matching SCTID 122636002. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This is more precise than generic 'gastrectomy specimen' or 'stomach specimen' concepts and avoids misclassification into distal stomach or non-gastrectomy specimens. The phrasing remains within the concept without extra attributes."
708675002,Gonial angle (observable entity),Mandibular gonial angle (observable),"The entry explicitly labels the gonial angle as an observable relating to the mandible, reinforcing that this is the measurement rather than an anatomical part. It maps directly to SNOMED CT concept 708675002 (Gonial angle) under Observable entity. Using a body structure concept for the mandibular angle would be incorrect, and broader 'angle' observables would be less specific. No additional attributes are introduced."
242820006,Exposure to direct ionizing radiation from nuclear explosion (event),Exposed to direct ionizing radiation from a nuclear blast,"The entry reports an exposure event to direct ionizing radiation and names the source as a nuclear blast, which is equivalent to nuclear explosion. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242820006 exactly captures direct ionizing radiation exposure from a nuclear explosion. Using a general parent like “Exposure to ionizing radiation (event)” would be less precise because the source and directness are specified here. Siblings such as exposure to fallout or contamination are excluded since the phrase highlights direct radiation, not residual or indirect exposure. The synonym “nuclear blast” does not alter the clinical meaning and remains within the specified concept."
117363000,Ordinal value (qualifier value),Result recorded as an ordinal value,"The entry states that the result's value is ordinal, which conveys that the result is expressed using ordered categories rather than numbers or unordered labels. The concept is a qualifier about value type; SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. Code 117363000 fits best, as it directly represents 'Ordinal value'. Parent concepts would be too general, and siblings like 'Nominal value' or 'Binary value' do not capture ordered category properties. The wording does not introduce any specific scale, severity, or magnitude, keeping it aligned with the generic ordinal value qualifier."
270358003,Life assurance - preliminary report (record artifact),Preliminary life assurance report,"Word order variation still conveys a preliminary report intended for life assurance. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 270358003 is the precise match, as it encodes a preliminary document in the life assurance domain. Broader report artifacts or different report statuses (final, interim) would be less accurate than the explicit preliminary designation in this entry. No additional attributes are introduced."
433484001,Natrinema pellirubrum (organism),Natrinema pellirubrum species listed,"The entry lists the species Natrinema pellirubrum, which unambiguously corresponds to the organism concept at the species level. The main concept is the organism; no additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. More general taxa or different species would not be appropriate given the exact name. 'Species listed' is contextual and maintains equivalence without altering code selection."
736367008,Anticipatory care plan (record artifact),Anticipatory care plan present,"The phrase conveys the existence of an anticipatory care plan artifact without adding other qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It maps to Anticipatory care plan (record artifact) by referring to the documented plan itself. Using a parent like Care plan would lose the anticipatory specificity, and siblings such as Advance care plan or Advance directive would be incorrect given the wording."
32911000087108,Paecilomyces puntonii (organism),Paecilomyces puntonii fungus,"The term identifies the species Paecilomyces puntonii and describes it as a fungus, which is a taxonomic descriptor consistent with the organism concept. No attributes like infection, colonization, or severity are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The precise match is Paecilomyces puntonii (organism), SCTID 32911000087108. Broader concepts like Fungi (organism) or the Paecilomyces genus would be less precise, and any disorder code would be inappropriate."
14228001,Dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase (substance),Dolichyl phosphate mannose–protein glycosyltransferase enzyme,"This variant uses the broader class term “glycosyltransferase” while preserving the specific donor (dolichyl phosphate mannose) and acceptor (protein), which constrains it to the same enzyme. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Although glycosyltransferase is a superclass, the explicit mannosyltransferase context is retained, making this equivalent to the preferred concept without adding new attributes. Purely generic glycosyltransferase terms would be too broad, but this phrasing remains specific to SCTID 14228001."
700869008,Package sealing unit (physical object),Package sealing device,"Main concept: a device intended for sealing packages; no additional characteristics are specified. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. ‘Device’ is a common synonym for ‘unit’ in equipment nomenclature, keeping the meaning intact, so this maps to Package sealing unit (700869008). Generic sealing devices are too broad, and modality-specific sealers (e.g., heat sealers) or type-specific package sealers (e.g., pouch sealers) are more specific than the entry indicates."
387288001,Prenylamine (substance),Documented substance term: prenylamine,"The entry records prenylamine as a substance term, focusing on the chemical entity and avoiding product semantics. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It maps to SCTID 387288001, as no salt form, brand, or dose is specified. More general parent concepts would be insufficiently specific, while children or sibling product concepts add attributes that are not in the text. 'Substance term' is a documentation context that remains clinically equivalent to the preferred substance concept."
284637003,Stabbing other person (finding),Stabbed a person other than self,"This entry conveys that the patient stabbed someone other than themselves, establishing other-directed stabbing. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. It matches 284637003 by specifying the act (stabbing) and target (another person), without adding details like instrument, motive, or time. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings depict different mechanisms of harm. The phrase 'other than self' preserves the same clinical meaning as 'other person.'"
458076000,Escherichia coli serotype O121:nonmotile (organism),Prior lab record: Escherichia coli O121:H- previously detected,"This references a prior detection of E. coli O121:H-, which denotes O121 with negative H antigen, i.e., nonmotile. SNOMED CT category: Organism. It maps to 458076000 because the serotype and nonmotility are explicit. The temporal context does not change the organism concept. Broader parents or serotype-only siblings are less precise; children with toxin/pathotype are not implied."
257574008,Brothel (environment),Brothel site,"The term 'site' here denotes the environmental location and is identified specifically as a brothel, adding no further attributes. It fits within the Environment category and maps to Brothel (environment) [257574008]. Parent concepts such as 'site' or 'place' are too broad, and sibling sites (e.g., nightclub site) would be incorrect. 'Site' is a neutral context label that keeps the concept focused on brothel."
43921001,Nickel compound (substance),Nickel compound identified in record,"The context is identification within a record, but the only concept named is the substance “nickel compound.” The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise code is SCTID 43921001 Nickel compound (substance). Elemental nickel or specific derivatives (salts, complexes) would add specificity not present in the text. The phrase remains semantically aligned to the general nickel compound concept."
1155805005,Presence of direct invasion by primary malignant neoplasm of uterus to lymphatic vessel and/or small blood vessel (observable entity),Histology comment: lymphovascular invasion present attributed to the primary uterine neoplasm.,"This histology comment reports that lymphovascular invasion is present and attributed to the primary uterine malignancy, indicating invasion into lymphatic and/or small blood vessels. The concept is an Observable entity marking presence. SNOMED 1155805005 is the most precise code because it describes presence of direct invasion by primary malignancy of the uterus into lymphatic and/or small vessels. Parent concepts lacking uterine specificity or children limited to a single vessel type are less appropriate. The term “lymphovascular invasion” is an accepted equivalent and does not modify code selection."
122569007,Sweat specimen (specimen),Perspiration specimen,"‘Perspiration’ is a clinically safe synonym for sweat, and ‘specimen’ signals the collected sample. The main concept is a specimen of sweat, category Specimen. No method, analyte, or site is introduced. Parent concepts (e.g., Body fluid specimen) are overly general, and sibling concepts (e.g., saliva, tear specimen) are not applicable. Therefore, Sweat specimen SCTID 122569007 is the best fit."
736253002,Mental health crisis plan (record artifact),Care coordination: mental health crisis plan available,"The phrase indicates availability of a documented mental health crisis plan within care coordination contexts, reaffirming it as a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is an exact fit for Mental health crisis plan (record artifact). Parent concepts like general care plans are too broad, and siblings such as safety plans or advance directives do not specifically address mental health crises as this entry does."
728213000,Entire tendon of posterior crural muscle (body structure),Entire tendon of posterior leg muscle (crural),"The entry cites the entire tendon and specifies the region as posterior leg, with '(crural)' clarifying that the leg refers to the lower leg. This retains the completeness attribute without adding laterality or specific muscle names. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and SCTID 728213000 is the most precise match. Concepts that are broader (without 'entire') or narrower (naming a particular tendon) are less appropriate for this generalized anatomical reference."
245070000,Structure of tendon of scalenus posterior (body structure),Scalenus posterior tendon,"The phrase denotes the tendon associated with the scalenus posterior muscle, with no mention of laterality, condition, or procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It is best coded as Structure of tendon of scalenus posterior (SCTID 245070000) and not as the muscle itself or a generic tendon. This synonym is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and introduces no new attributes."
1162669007,Volume of wound drainage of serosanguinous fluid (observable entity),Volume of wound drainage consisting of serosanguinous fluid,"This phrasing explicitly states the volume of wound drainage and clarifies that the fluid consists of serosanguinous material, aligning with SCTID 1162669007. There are no additional attributes such as rate, location, timeframe, or method included. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. A broader parent concept would omit the fluid-type detail, and a sibling concept addressing other fluid types or different observables (e.g., rate) would be inappropriate. The wording is a precise paraphrase that maintains the concept’s scope."
60978003,Product containing barbiturate (product),Medication list: barbiturate-containing product,"This is documentation context indicating the presence of a barbiturate-containing product on a medication list, still referring to the product concept itself. The best match is Product containing barbiturate (product), SCTID 60978003 in the Pharmaceutical/biologic product hierarchy. No additional attributes like dose, route, or specific ingredient are provided, so child concepts are not implicated. The context of a medication list does not change the coding hierarchy. The term remains a class-based product reference."
118370003,Low energy infrared laser beam (physical force),Diagnostic report terminology — low energy infrared laser beam,"This phrasing sets a diagnostic report context while still naming the physical force precisely: low energy infrared laser beam. The SNOMED category is Physical force, and SCTID 118370003 is the best match. It does not assert presence, exposure, or outcomes, avoiding mapping to findings or events; nor does it broaden to generic infrared laser beams."
223867008,Buckinghamshire (geographic location),Employer location: Buckinghamshire,"This is a social context reference, but the coded concept is the place Buckinghamshire itself. In SNOMED CT, the category is Geographic location, mapping to Buckinghamshire (geographic location), SCTID 223867008. There is no mention of broader regions or specific towns; hence parent or child concepts are less suitable. The term keeps the semantics focused on the geographic location only."
730480004,Entire myocardial primordium (body structure),Entire cardiac muscle primordium,"“Cardiac muscle” is synonymous with “myocardium,” and “primordium” denotes the embryologic precursor. Category: Body structure. The use of “entire” makes this an exact match for Entire myocardial primordium (730480004), whereas more generic or partial references would better fit parent concepts or different anatomical primordia."
444754002,Hospital inpatient progress report (record artifact),Hospital inpatient progress report completed and signed,"The entry describes the completion status of the hospital inpatient progress report but retains the artifact’s identity. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Completion/signature are workflow attributes and do not introduce new clinical details. The document type remains a progress report for hospital inpatients, not a consult, admission, or discharge report, justifying SCTID 444754002."
226086005,Low biological value protein diet (finding),Diet label: low biological value protein,"This entry designates the diet label as low biological value protein, indicating the diet’s defining characteristic. It is a Clinical finding because it documents a patient’s diet. SCTID 226086005 is the exact match, representing low biological value protein diet; parent dietary labels are too generic, and siblings (low protein diet or high biological value protein diet) differ in attribute focus and would not accurately reflect this diet description."
465263000,Automobile seat cushion (physical object),Automobile seat cushion noted,"Main concept: automobile seat cushion; ‘noted’ is a documentation verb that does not change the object identity. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This matches 465263000 for the cushion part of a car seat. Parent concepts like automobile seat are too broad, and sibling concepts like seat cover or booster seat are not indicated."
285404001,Pressure blast (physical force),Pressure blast (physical force),"This entry reproduces the SNOMED CT FSN, making it an exact lexical match to SCTID 285404001. Category: Physical force. It conveys only the physical mechanism (pressure blast) without introducing injury, exposure, timing, or cause beyond the inherent blast context within the concept itself. Parent concepts like 'Physical force' are too general, and disorder concepts like 'blast injury' are not appropriate because this entry describes the force, not a diagnosis. No alternative code is more precise than the FSN."
213942008,Crushed by rolling stock - pedal cyclist (event),Follow-up: prior event of being crushed by rolling stock as a bicyclist,"The follow-up wording refers to the same external cause event, with mechanism “crushed by rolling stock” and the role “bicyclist” (pedal cyclist), consistent with SCTID 213942008 under the Event hierarchy. The term does not add specific timing beyond acknowledging prior occurrence, nor does it specify injuries or vehicle subtypes. Parents lacking the role and siblings with alternate roles or mechanisms would be less fitting than this precise match."
1332318005,Interviewer led Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnea subscale score (observable entity),Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnea domain score — interviewer-led,"This entry spells out the instrument (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire), identifies the dyspnea domain, and states interviewer-led administration, which maps directly to SCTID 1332318005. The concept is an Observable entity representing a specific subscale score. It precisely excludes other domains and administration modes; therefore, parents such as general CRQ scores or siblings like self-administered dyspnea domain scores are less appropriate."
224855002,Middle school (environment),Middle school (environment),"The main concept explicitly stated is the environment identified as a middle school. This belongs to the SNOMED CT hierarchy Environment or geographical location (environment). The preferred term directly matches SCTID 224855002 and is the most precise selection. Broader parents like School (environment) or Educational institution (environment) are less specific, and siblings such as Elementary school or High school (environment) would not fit the wording. No additional attributes (cause, severity, timing, laterality) are introduced."
773947005,Genus Diheterospora (organism),Recorded organism: Diheterospora,"This indicates that the organism recorded is Diheterospora, without specifying species or any clinical details. The main concept is the genus Diheterospora. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the best match is SCTID 773947005. Parent concepts would not capture genus specificity, and child species are not stated. The administrative phrasing does not add attributes like severity or site, keeping the entry strictly taxonomic."
60132005,Generalized (qualifier value),Marked as generalized,"The entry indicates the item was marked with the qualifier ‘generalized,’ strictly describing extent/distribution and not severity or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It aligns with Generalized (qualifier value) SCTID 60132005. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling qualifiers like Localized or Diffuse would not reflect the exact term used. No condition concept is present, so the qualifier code is the most accurate choice."
444905003,Mass of soft tissue (finding),Soft tissue mass,"The main concept expressed is a mass located in soft tissue without any additional qualifiers such as site, laterality, cause, or behavior. This aligns directly with SNOMED CT 444905003 Mass of soft tissue (finding), which is a Clinical finding. Parent concepts like generic Mass (without specifying soft tissue) are too broad, while child concepts that add an anatomical site or etiology are too specific and not indicated here. The phrasing is a standard synonym and does not introduce attributes that would change the code selection."
309493009,Bile duct biopsy specimen (specimen),Bile duct biopsy tissue (specimen),"This entry specifies bile duct tissue obtained as a biopsy and clarifies that it is a specimen, not a procedure. The main concept is a bile duct biopsy specimen, which fits the SNOMED CT Specimen class and corresponds to SCTID 309493009. No additional attributes such as sub-duct specificity, extent, or timing are present. It is distinct from related specimen types like brushings or resections. Parents like “Bile duct specimen” lack the biopsy qualifier, making the selected code the most precise match."
169611005,No antenatal care: subject unaware of pregnancy (situation),Pregnancy not recognized by patient; no antenatal care taken.,"The statement indicates that the patient did not recognize the pregnancy, resulting in no antenatal care, which is the defining context of the concept. This aligns with a Situation with explicit context and maps directly to SNOMED CT 169611005. It does not introduce other reasons or timing qualifiers, making broader or alternate reason concepts less suitable. “Not recognized by patient” is clinically equivalent to “subject unaware.”"
216379005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, sports ground (environment)",Event location (accident/poisoning): sports pitch,"Sports pitch is a common synonym for sports ground, and the entry explicitly ties it to an accident/poisoning event location. This corresponds precisely to Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, sports ground (environment) (SCTID: 216379005) under Environment or geographical location. The wording does not introduce any other attributes or suggest a different setting like playground, stadium, or indoor gym; thus, parent or sibling concepts are less fitting, and the synonym remains clinically equivalent."
215801009,"Crushed between ship and wharf, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)",Injured when crushed between a ship and the wharf as an occupant of a small unpowered boat,"This entry restates the scenario with the same core attributes: occupant of small unpowered boat, crushed between ship and wharf, injury occurred. It fits the SNOMED Event category and corresponds to code 215801009. Parent or sibling concepts that differ in vessel type, role, or mechanism (e.g., powered boat, struck by vessel) are less appropriate. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent, not introducing timing, severity, or associated conditions."
442974002,Streptococcus pyogenes type emm95 (organism),Streptococcus pyogenes of emm95 type,"The entry explicitly designates Streptococcus pyogenes with the emm95 type, corresponding to SCTID 442974002 in the Organism hierarchy. The phrase 'of emm95 type' is a semantically equivalent way to express the emm95 typing and does not introduce extra attributes. Parent concepts lacking emm typing are too broad, and sibling emm types would not fit. No mention of disease, site, resistance, or timing is present, ensuring precise organism-level coding."
1268554008,Lauren classification of adenocarcinoma in stomach (staging scale),Lauren classification of adenocarcinoma in stomach,"The phrase explicitly names the Lauren classification applied to adenocarcinoma in the stomach, referring to the named histopathologic classification framework, not a result. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value (Staging scale). This matches the scale concept itself rather than a finding, stage, or histologic type outcome. Parent concepts like generic staging scales are too broad, and child/sibling concepts that represent specific Lauren types (e.g., intestinal or diffuse) would require a stated result, which is absent here. The wording is the preferred term, ensuring precise alignment with the scale concept."
4712005,Removal of Gardner Wells tongs from skull (procedure),Gardner-Wells tongs removed from skull,"Main concept: Gardner-Wells tongs removal from the skull. Category: Procedure. This clear declarative statement directly corresponds to SNOMED CT 4712005. Generic device removal or cranial traction device removal would be less precise, and sibling concepts for other brands or for insertion/loosening are not the same action. No extra clinical attributes are present; synonyms like ‘removed’ are standard for the removal procedure."
285405000,Low air pressure (physical force),Atmospheric pressure low,"This entry restates the same physical force using 'atmospheric' as a clinically standard synonym for air pressure. It conveys only that the surrounding atmospheric pressure is low, fitting the Physical force category. Low air pressure (physical force) [285405000] is the exact concept, whereas a parent like Atmospheric pressure (physical force) would be too generic and environmental exposure concepts would be inappropriate since no exposure context is stated."
367454001,Patients own foot orthosis (physical object),Clinic note: patient's own foot orthosis present.,"This clinical documentation indicates the presence of a foot orthosis owned by the patient; it does not assert wearing, fitting, or other actions, nor does it specify type or laterality. Category: Physical object. The precise code is 'Patient's own foot orthosis (physical object)' [367454001]. A parent device concept lacks the ownership attribute, and sibling procedure/finding codes would misrepresent the simple presence of the item."
257451007,Running water (event),Observation: running water,"The entry frames a documented observation of running water, but the underlying concept is simply water running. Main concept: running water; category: Event. It matches SNOMED CT 257451007 because no extra attributes (source, location, timing, severity) are introduced. Choosing broader parent concepts would be imprecise, and selecting child/sibling concepts (tap running, river flow, standing water) would add specificity not present. The label ""Observation:"" does not change the event being coded."
284749009,Newsagents shop (environment),Location: newsagents shop,"This entry explicitly documents the location as a newsagents shop, aligning with an Environment concept. The format is typical of clinical documentation without adding causation or event details. Using a parent concept like Shop (environment) would drop specificity, and siblings such as bookstore or kiosk would misrepresent the setting. Hence, Newsagents shop (environment) [284749009] is the exact code."
258135008,Continued movement (physical force),Physical force present: continued movement,"This entry indicates the presence of the physical force continued movement without further qualifiers. The main concept is the Physical force 'continued movement.' The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, matched to SCTID 258135008. It does not imply other forces like impact, nor does it generalize to the parent concept."
65693004,Triodontophorus (organism),Identified organism: Triodontophorus,"This report-style entry states Triodontophorus as the organism identified, mapping to the SNOMED CT organism concept Triodontophorus (SCTID: 65693004). The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No infection, site, host, or species-level information is provided, avoiding disorder or species child concepts. Parent taxa would not be as specific. The genus-level organism concept is the exact and most appropriate match."
223408006,Tortola (geographic location),Site location: Tortola,"This entry labels a site location and names it Tortola, clearly indicating a geographic place rather than an anatomical site. The correct SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location), and the precise code is Tortola (geographic location), SCTID 223408006. The heading “Site location” is contextual metadata and does not add new attributes to the place. A parent concept would be less specific, and sibling or child places are not referenced. The wording remains uniquely codable to the Tortola location."
1345230008,Tablet submitted as specimen (specimen),Tablet accepted by laboratory as specimen,"This states that the lab accepted a tablet as the specimen, which exactly fits 'Tablet submitted as specimen' (SCTID 1345230008) under Specimen. Acceptance is procedural context; the specimen’s identity remains a tablet. The specificity prevents mapping to parent concepts and avoids siblings (e.g., capsules). No additional attributes are present, ensuring a unique match to the tablet specimen concept."
310854009,Housing report (record artifact),Report: Housing,"This is a common report titling pattern that conveys the artifact type (report) and subject (housing), which is semantically identical to 'Housing report.' Category: Record artifact. It does not imply housing status or an assessment finding; it strictly refers to the document artifact. Parent concepts like 'Report' are too general, and siblings like 'Home assessment report' would add an assessment attribute not present here."
714340009,Implanted device maintenance report (record artifact),Technical report—implanted device maintenance,"This entry specifies a technical report that documents maintenance of an implanted device, indicating a report artifact. The concepts are technical report (document type), maintenance, and implanted device, with no introduction of timing or device type. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Record artifact category and maps to SCTID 714340009 Implanted device maintenance report. A generic technical report concept would be too broad, and device-specific or monitoring reports would misalign with maintenance. The descriptor “technical” indicates document style, not a different clinical concept, and does not change code selection."
255433005,Mucous (qualifier value),Noted quality term: mucous,"The entry notes a quality term specified as “mucous,” clearly an adjectival descriptor. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. Best match: Mucous (qualifier value) [255433005]. It would not map to “Mucus (substance)” since no material is named. The wording avoids alternative qualifiers like “mucoid” or “mucinous.” No additional clinical attributes are included."
1380256003,Cat hair diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy panel component: cat hair diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry specifies that the panel includes a cat hair diagnostic allergen extract component. Main concepts: cat hair diagnostic allergen extract; panel inclusion context. Category: Product. It maps to SCTID 1380256003 because the product is clearly identified and used diagnostically. Broader allergen products or different source allergens (e.g., dander) would be less accurate, and therapeutic extracts are excluded. The contextual wording remains a clinically equivalent expression of the same product concept."
44027008,Seafood (substance),Sea food,"This variant spacing is a clinically equivalent synonym for seafood, still denoting the generic marine-derived edible substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The preferred code 44027008 remains the exact match because the wording does not imply a specific type (e.g., fish-only or shellfish-only), nor does it suggest a product or a prepared dish. Using the alternate spacing does not introduce any attribute changes, so parent (Dietary substance) or siblings (Fish, Shellfish) are less appropriate."
443881004,Adelaide pediatric coma score (observable entity),Adelaide Paediatric Coma Score (APCS),"The British spelling plus abbreviation APCS continues to denote the Adelaide pediatric coma scoring instrument itself. This maps to SNOMED CT 443881004 (Observable entity). No measurement, severity, timing, or associated condition is stated, so child concepts pertaining to results are not implicated, and alternative scales are excluded by the explicit Adelaide pediatric designation."
309144007,Thyroid lobe specimen (specimen),Pathology specimen: thyroid lobe,"This designates the pathology specimen as a thyroid lobe, mapping directly to the Specimen concept 'Thyroid lobe specimen'. No additional attributes such as laterality or technique are introduced, so SCTID 309144007 is optimal. Parent concepts (thyroid gland or unspecified thyroid tissue specimens) are not as precise, while children (excision/biopsy/FNA from thyroid lobe) add collection details absent here. Sibling concepts that include laterality are not applicable."
118358002,Red laser light (physical force),Chart note: red laser light,"This contextual entry places the term in documentation but the concept itself remains the physical phenomenon of red laser light. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. The correct code is Red laser light (physical force) [118358002] because the term explicitly specifies red laser light. Parent concepts are too general, and device/procedure codes are not appropriate since no device or action is asserted; the context label does not alter the concept."
925002,Sodium iodipamide (substance),Substance term selected: sodium iodipamide,"The selected term is 'sodium iodipamide,' directly denoting the chemical substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the most precise concept is Sodium iodipamide (925002). No extra attributes (dose form, route, timing, indication, adverse reaction) are introduced, so product or clinical event concepts do not apply. The sodium salt specification prevents mapping to the general iodipamide parent or any sibling salt variant."
10761591000119105,Supervision of high risk pregnancy for social problem done (situation),Maternity care supervision for high-risk pregnancy (social problem) done,"The phrase indicates that maternity care supervision was done for a high-risk pregnancy, and the supervision is specifically for a social problem. The main concept is supervision of high-risk pregnancy for social problem with status done. The category is Situation with explicit context because it signifies an event completed. SCTID 10761591000119105 is the best fit, as it encodes supervision of high-risk pregnancy for social problem with a done context. A parent concept like generic high-risk pregnancy supervision done without social problem, or a sibling like supervision of pregnancy for social problem done without high-risk, would be less precise. “Maternity care supervision” is a clinically equivalent phrasing to supervision of pregnancy and does not change coding."
1003759005,Size of epiphysis of bone (observable entity),Epiphysis of bone — size,"This formatting emphasizes that the target structure is the bone epiphysis and the attribute is size, corresponding exactly to the observable entity for epiphysis size (SCTID: 1003759005). There are no additional qualifiers. Parent concepts covering general bone structure size would be less specific, and children specifying a particular skeletal site would be overly specific. The wording retains identical semantics to the preferred concept."
419938001,Milligrams per deciliter erythrocytes (qualifier value),"mg/dL, red cells","The entry conveys mg/dL with the red cell (erythrocyte) matrix. The main concept is the erythrocyte-qualified unit of measure, which is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT. SCTID 419938001 is the appropriate code because it represents mg/dL within erythrocytes. Generic mg/dL (parent) lacks matrix specificity; siblings referring to serum or plasma are incorrect. “Red cells” equates clinically to erythrocytes, leaving the unit semantics unchanged."
285111006,Railway sidings (environment),Train sidings (environment),"The phrase explicitly denotes the environment and uses 'train sidings' as a synonym for railway sidings, clarifying the context as an environmental setting. The concept type is Environment or geographical location. It corresponds precisely to Railway sidings (environment), SCTID 285111006. Terms like 'rail yard' or 'station' would broaden or shift the location, but 'sidings' is specific. No additional attributes (e.g., timing, injury, cause) are included, so the environment code is the most accurate selection."
373373000,Poorly differentiated histological grade finding (finding),Poorly differentiated status on histology,"This describes the status on histology as 'poorly differentiated,' indicating the histologic grade finding. The main concept is the differentiation level; there are no extra attributes. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. It matches SCTID 373373000 because the status 'poorly differentiated' is the exact grade. It is not the parent generic grade, nor does it drift into sibling grades like 'undifferentiated' or 'moderately differentiated.'"
367692007,Entire vulvar mucous membrane (body structure),Anatomical site: entire vulvar mucosa,"This entry presents the concept in an anatomic-site documentation context while maintaining 'entire' and 'vulvar mucosa.' It is a Body structure. SCTID 367692007 is correct because the site is the complete mucous membrane of the vulva. A generic 'Mucosa of vulva' lacks the whole-structure qualifier, and substructures (e.g., labia minora mucosa) would be too specific. The contextual label 'Anatomical site' does not add clinical attributes."
773130005,Nursing care plan (record artifact),Nurse-authored care plan,"The phrase emphasizes authorship by nursing, which is the defining characteristic of a nursing care plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It matches SCTID 773130005, distinguishing it from multidisciplinary or physician-authored care plans. It does not describe the process of care planning; it refers to the document itself. Parent concepts are overly broad, and sibling concepts differ by discipline. The synonym is clinically equivalent to 'nursing care plan' and does not change code selection."
75265007,Cytidine (substance),Cytidine on order,"The phrase indicates an order for cytidine and still points to the specific chemical substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It does not mention dosage, route, or a modified form (e.g., deoxy or phosphate), so it aligns precisely with Cytidine (substance) [75265007]. Coding to a parent (Nucleoside) would lose specificity, and sibling/child entities such as uridine or cytidine monophosphate are not suggested."
368021006,Structure of outer surface of third rib (body structure),Third rib outer surface,"This compact phrasing conveys the same anatomical concept: the outer surface of the third rib, with the modifiers 'outer' and rib number clearly present. It is an anatomical Body structure. The entry does not introduce any condition or procedure and is more specific than the entire third rib while excluding the inner surface or other ribs. Hence, it appropriately maps to the structure of the outer surface of the third rib."
264320005,Radiographic iodinated contrast medium (qualifier value),X-ray iodine-based contrast medium,"Using “iodine-based” for “iodinated” and “X-ray” for radiographic, this entry conveys the same qualifier concept: an iodinated contrast medium for radiographic imaging. It maps to SNOMED CT 264320005 (Qualifier value) and introduces no additional attributes. Generic radiographic contrast qualifiers are less specific, and MRI/gadolinium siblings are not relevant. The synonyms are clinically equivalent and support the precise code."
445080004,Aonyx cinereus (organism),Aonyx cinereus organism noted,"This states the organism Aonyx cinereus with minimal contextual wording ('noted'), which does not add clinical attributes. It corresponds to SNOMED CT Organism concept 445080004. Using a parent taxon or generic otter would reduce specificity, and sibling species would miscode. The species identification is precise and unchanged by the note context."
732975005,Fluid specimen from epididymis (specimen),Pathology accession: epididymal fluid specimen,"Accession context does not add attributes beyond specimen type and source; the entry identifies an epididymal fluid specimen. This is a Specimen category concept, and the exact match is Fluid specimen from epididymis (specimen), SCTID 732975005. More general or alternative specimens (e.g., tissue, swab, semen) would not be appropriate given the explicit 'fluid' and 'epididymal' description."
420392001,Planomicrobium okeanokoites (organism),Taxonomic entry — Planomicrobium okeanokoites,"The phrase indicates a taxonomic listing of Planomicrobium okeanokoites, pointing to the SNOMED CT Organism concept SCTID 420392001. It conveys only the species identity and avoids clinical attributes or context that would suggest a finding or disorder. Because it specifies the species, it should not be coded to broader taxonomic parents or to related but different species."
473448003,Non-coronary systemic artery structure (body structure),Non-coronary systemic artery anatomy,"This phrase denotes the anatomical subject as a non-coronary systemic artery. It resides within the Body structure hierarchy. By explicitly excluding coronary arteries, it precisely matches Non-coronary systemic artery structure and is more specific than the parent concept that includes coronary arteries. It avoids naming particular arteries that would suggest child concepts. The synonym “anatomy” keeps the meaning intact without adding attributes."
700856009,Assistive signature guide/stamp/writing frame (physical object),Supplies: assistive signature guide/stamp/writing frame,"The entry lists the assistive signature guide/stamp/writing frame under a supplies context label, which does not add attributes beyond identifying the physical object. It matches the Physical object concept SCTID 700856009. Including all three variants preserves the exact scope of the concept. A broader parent would be less specific, and sibling items, such as other writing aids or non-assistive stamps, are not indicated. No separate child concept is implied; the phrasing aligns with the concept’s synonyms."
438275001,Streptomyces massasporeus (organism),Streptomyces massasporeus,"The entry cites the exact binomial species name Streptomyces massasporeus, which is an organism and fits SNOMED CT concept 438275001 in the Organism category. No clinical attributes such as infection, site, or timing are asserted—only the organism’s identity. A parent concept like Streptomyces (genus) would be too broad, and any sibling/child species (e.g., other Streptomyces species) would be inaccurate. The wording matches the preferred term precisely and therefore is the most specific, correct code."
308575004,Employment report (record artifact),Employment report uploaded to record,"The entry indicates an employment report was uploaded to the record, but the artifact itself is the concept being represented. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Employment report (record artifact) [308575004] is the correct code because the document is explicitly an employment report. The upload action is contextual and does not shift this to a procedural concept; the artifact remains the focus. Parent generic report concepts lack the employment qualifier, and sibling documents are not implied. No additional content attributes are added."
720105008,Antibody to Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 glycoprotein 21e (substance),Western blot probe: HTLV-I gp21e antibody,"This wording identifies the antibody to HTLV-I gp21e as a probe in a Western blot, maintaining focus on the substance and its antigen specificity without implying results or further attributes. It is a Substance concept in SNOMED CT. SCTID 720105008 is the best fit because it corresponds exactly to the HTLV-I glycoprotein 21e antibody. Broader or different antigen targets would map to parent or sibling concepts, respectively. The methodological context does not change the substance identity."
60428009,Skin structure of medial margin of forearm (body structure),Reference location: skin at the medial rim of the forearm,"This identifies the reference location as the skin at the forearm’s medial rim, which is synonymous with the medial margin. Concept: cutaneous body structure at a boundary of the forearm; category: Body structure. SNOMED CT 60428009 is appropriate because it represents skin at the medial margin. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings involving other rims/margins or non-cutaneous structures would misrepresent the site. ‘Rim’ here is a synonym for ‘margin/border’ and does not alter the anatomical scope."
76661004,Altitude (physical force),Altitude mentioned in history,"This documentation phrase notes altitude within history-taking, still pointing to the physical force concept rather than measurement or disorder. In SNOMED CT, the category is Physical force, and the exact code is Altitude (physical force) 76661004. It avoids added attributes like magnitude, timing, or health effects, so observable entity or exposure/event concepts are not indicated. The parent Physical force is too broad, and siblings (temperature, gravity) are not implicated. The phrasing is a contextual paraphrase that preserves the same code."
224058004,Illinois (geographic location),In-text location: Illinois,"This indicates that the referenced location in the text is Illinois. The main concept is Illinois, a state-level geographic entity. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 224058004 is the precise code. No broader or narrower location is implied. The phrase “In-text location” is a documentation context rather than an attribute of the concept, so the coded concept remains Illinois without added clinical characteristics."
293941008,Allergy to trifluoperazine (finding),Confirmed allergy to trifluoperazine,The entry indicates a verified allergy status to trifluoperazine and avoids adding any attributes like severity or temporal details. It represents a Clinical finding and corresponds exactly to Allergy to trifluoperazine (finding) [SCTID: 293941008]. Parent concepts lack specificity and disorder concepts denoting reactions would imply an event not present here. ‘Confirmed’ does not change the underlying concept; it remains the same allergy finding.
423374008,Review of systems section (record artifact),Review of systems section in surgical H&P,"The text places the review of systems section within a surgical history and physical document, still denoting the section artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Code 423374008 is the correct match because it specifies the ROS section. A parent 'H&P section' would be too broad, and other sections of the H&P are not referenced. There is no mention of performing the ROS or any symptom content, excluding procedural or finding mappings."
361391003,Structure of regional peripheral nerve (body structure),"Regional peripheral nerve, anatomical site","The entry points to the anatomical site being a regional peripheral nerve, which maps to SNOMED CT Body structure 361391003. It does not introduce laterality, localization beyond 'regional,' or pathology, making it more precise than the parent and less specific than any child naming a particular nerve. The comma-separated phrasing does not change semantic content."
37455005,Lymphocyte blast cell transformation assay (procedure),In vitro lymphocyte transformation assay,"Main concept: an in vitro assay evaluating lymphocyte transformation (blast formation and proliferation). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The phrase “in vitro” is inherent to this assay and does not introduce a different code; it remains the same procedure as 37455005. The entry avoids specifying stimuli, subsets, methods, or results, so narrower child concepts are not indicated, and broader parent categories are less precise."
251946003,Dead space/tidal volume ratio (observable entity),VD/VT,"This entry uses the standard clinical abbreviation for the dead space to tidal volume ratio. The concept is an Observable entity, and VD/VT is a widely accepted synonym that conveys exactly the same parameter without adding attributes. It is distinct from other ratios (e.g., VD/VE) and from the individual components (VD or VT), making the SNOMED concept Dead space/tidal volume ratio the most appropriate code."
248111006,Rape (event),Forced sexual intercourse,"This phrase denotes non-consensual sexual intercourse, which is clinically synonymous with rape as an event. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and the concept Rape (event) [SCTID: 248111006] is the precise match. The wording does not introduce extra attributes like timing, location, or perpetrator details. Broader concepts such as Sexual assault (event) would not be as specific, and variants like Attempted rape are not indicated. The synonym reflects the core definition of rape without altering code selection."
1306583007,"European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing category 2019 Susceptible, increased exposure (qualifier value)","Antibiogram interpretation (EUCAST 2019): Susceptible, increased exposure","The main concept is the EUCAST 2019 categorical interpretation “Susceptible, increased exposure” applied to an antibiogram context. This is a qualifier value used for categorizing susceptibility, aligning with SNOMED CT Qualifier value 1306583007. The entry does not mention any particular organism, antimicrobial, or dosing specifics beyond the inherent category name. Alternative parent or sibling concepts (e.g., “Susceptible, standard dosing regimen,” “Resistant,” or non-2019 EUCAST categories) would be incorrect given the explicit category and year. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym that conveys the same qualifier value without changing the code."
128309002,Radiologic infiltrate (finding),Infiltrate identified by radiology,"This indicates that an infiltrate has been identified via radiologic assessment, and does not include location or cause. The main concept is radiologic infiltrate; category Clinical finding. It precisely matches SCTID 128309002 because it qualifies infiltrate as radiologic. Parent concepts would be too general, while child or sibling concepts that specify organ or modality beyond the radiologic context would be inappropriate here."
285833006,Liquid pressure (physical force),Patient describes pressure from liquid,"Despite the patient context, the core concept is the physical force exerted by a liquid. It stays within the Physical force category and does not introduce additional attributes or narrower mechanisms. It is not gas or atmospheric pressure and not a measurement finding, so SCTID 285833006 is appropriate."
898199003,Recombinant coagulation factor VIII (substance),Inventory term: recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII,"The inventory context does not change the substance identity, which is “recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII.” The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This maps best to SCTID 898199003 because it specifies the recombinant attribute, distinguishing it from the broader parent concept. There is no mention of brand-specific ingredients, extended half-life constructs, or other modifications, so child concepts are not appropriate. Absent dose, route, or indication, it remains a substance rather than a medicinal product or procedure. “Antihemophilic factor VIII” is a clinically equivalent synonym for Factor VIII."
218093003,"Accident caused by Verey pistol, flare (event)",Incident: accident related to flare gun,"The entry reports an incident in which the accident is related to a flare gun, identifying the external cause. Category is Event. It maps to 218093003, focusing on the flare gun/Verey pistol as the accidental mechanism, without extra attributes. This excludes broader firearm categories or fireworks-related accidents, ensuring precision to the specified flare device."
433842001,Halochromatium salexigens (organism),Patient summary mentions Halochromatium salexigens,"The concept explicitly mentioned is the species Halochromatium salexigens, cited in a patient summary context. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The narrative context does not alter the species reference, so SCTID 433842001 remains correct. Mapping to a general organism category or to another species would not fit the explicit naming."
223595001,Viet Nam (geographic location),Location specified as Vietnam,"This statement assigns a location value and that value is Vietnam, a country. Category: Geographic location. It maps directly to Viet Nam (geographic location), SCTID 223595001. The entry does not introduce attributes like residence status or event type; it identifies the place only. Broader geographic parents or more granular child entities would not match the level of specificity conveyed."
284435001,Footpath (environment),Footpath environment,"This explicitly names the environment as 'footpath,' directly referencing the environmental location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, coded as Footpath (environment) SCTID 284435001. Using a parent 'path' or sibling 'sidewalk' would not be as precise given the text. The word 'environment' here clarifies the hierarchy and does not introduce new attributes."
256543000,Spad - root canal obturation material (substance),Inventory item: Spad root canal obturation material,"The inventory context does not change the substance concept; it still identifies Spad as the root canal obturation material. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The most precise code is Spad - root canal obturation material (256543000). A generic parent would be less specific, and sibling brand items would be different materials."
260527004,Orthograde approach (qualifier value),Orthograde approach documented,"The wording communicates that the documented approach is orthograde, mapping exactly to the Qualifier value 'Orthograde approach' (SCTID 260527004). Documentation context does not introduce additional medical attributes; it simply records the approach. This is more specific than the general 'Approach' parent concept and does not imply any sibling approach values, making the orthograde qualifier the correct selection."
472885008,Swab from pressure injury (specimen),Microbiology specimen—swab from pressure injury,"This entry frames the specimen context (microbiology) and specifies the specimen as a swab from a pressure injury. The key concept remains a swab specimen sourced from a pressure injury. Category: Specimen. The best SNOMED CT match is 472885008 because the specimen type and source are explicit. General parents such as “Swab specimen” are less precise. Sibling concepts implying different wound etiologies would not fit. The microbiology context does not change the core specimen concept nor add attributes; it simply indicates typical usage. No mention of ulcer, stage, or site prevents mapping to child or more detailed concepts."
1279504008,American Joint Committee on Cancer ycN category allowable value (qualifier value),AJCC ycN N-category code value (allowed),"The entry states an allowed code value for the AJCC ycN N-category, explicitly linking to the N component and the yc (post-therapy clinical) prefix. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It is the most accurate match to SCTID 1279504008 because it specifies the permissible coded values for ycN rather than the ycN observable entity or specific outcomes (ycN0, ycN1). Using “allowed code value” remains semantically equivalent to allowable value and does not add attributes such as staging version or tumor type."
773598009,Gastroenterology care plan (record artifact),GI plan of care referenced in report,"This indicates that a GI plan of care exists and is referenced within a report, still identifying the care plan artifact. The category is Record artifact, with the most precise code being Gastroenterology care plan (record artifact) [773598009]. The reporting context does not convert the concept to a consultation report or referral. Parent generic care plan is less precise; sibling specialty care plans would not fit. No added clinical attributes are conveyed."
252719004,Goniometry of finger (procedure),Clinic report—goniometry performed on a finger,"This narrative confirms goniometry was carried out on a finger, which corresponds to the Procedure concept 'Goniometry of finger' (SCTID 252719004). It does not add laterality or identify a specific finger, avoiding child codes. A general goniometry code would omit the body site detail, making this concept the most precise match. The paraphrase maintains equivalence to the preferred term."
223776005,New South Wales (geographic location),Place: New South Wales,"This entry uses a generic label ‘Place’ with the value New South Wales, focusing on the geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and SCTID 223776005 accurately represents it. The phrasing avoids introducing new attributes or a different concept class. No broader country-level or narrower subregional references are made, ruling out parent or child concepts."
701228000,"Stationary cephalometric x-ray system, analog (physical object)",Fixed film-based cephalometric radiography system,"The concept expressed is a cephalometric radiography system that is fixed (synonym for stationary) and film-based (synonym for analog), which together define the device as non-digital and non-mobile. Category: Physical object (device/equipment). These synonyms are clinically equivalent and preserve the exact attributes required for SNOMED CT 701228000. Using only 'fixed' without analog would map to a broader stationary system, and 'digital' would point to a sibling, so this formulation is the most precise match."
169209006,Ultraviolet radiation in diagnosis (physical force),Diagnostic ultraviolet radiation,"The phrase conveys the physical agent ultraviolet radiation constrained to a diagnostic use by the modifier “diagnostic.” Category: Physical force. This fits SNOMED CT 169209006, specifying UV radiation in a diagnostic context rather than therapeutic or general. More general parents (UV radiation without context) are less precise, and sibling concepts (e.g., therapeutic UV) are ruled out. “Diagnostic ultraviolet radiation” is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not add extra attributes and thus selects the same code."
258194005,Dominant type I (qualifier value),Dominant type I label,"“Label” reflects the applied name for the qualifier and does not add new clinical content. The main concept is the Qualifier value “Dominant type I,” mapping to SCTID 258194005. It excludes broader parents and other type siblings by specifying “type I,” and it introduces no additional attributes such as cause or laterality, keeping the code selection precise."
257000006,B*4003 (substance),B*40:03,"This entry uses the modern colon-separated format B*40:03, which is a clinically equivalent representation of B*4003. The main concept is the specific HLA-B substance, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches SCTID 257000006 precisely, as the colon formatting is nomenclature variation, not a different concept. Broader parents (e.g., HLA-B antigen) or sibling alleles (e.g., B*40:01) would not be correct given the exact numeric specification 40:03."
285162009,Ability to recognize objects by sight (observable entity),Testing domain: ability to identify objects visually,"Using 'identify' as a synonym for 'recognize,' the entry specifies the testing domain focused on visual object identification ability, which maps to SCTID 285162009. The main concept is an Observable entity (ability), with no added attributes like severity or outcome. Parent concepts of general visual recognition are too broad; siblings (face or letter recognition) are different constructs. The object-specific visual modality ensures this is the most precise observable code."
110932008,Parotid gland cytologic material (specimen),Lab specimen—parotid gland cytology,"This lab-centric phrasing indicates a cytology specimen sourced from the parotid gland, which is a specimen concept. It maps to Parotid gland cytologic material (specimen) SCTID 110932008 in the Specimen category. The entry avoids any mention of collection technique, laterality, or histologic tissue, so more specific children like fine-needle aspirate or unrelated siblings like tissue biopsy are excluded. A generic parent like salivary gland cytology would be too broad. The term 'cytology' conveys cellular material, maintaining equivalence with the preferred concept."
409854007,Order Burkholderiales (organism),Burkholderiales order classification,"This entry denotes a classification at the order level for Burkholderiales and includes no clinical details such as presence, severity, or site. The SNOMED CT category is Organism; the most precise concept is Order Burkholderiales (organism), SCTID 409854007. It does not name genera or species (children) and does not refer to higher ranks, ensuring parent concepts are not more appropriate. The wording is an equivalent paraphrase focusing on taxonomy."
1345201001,Present two plus out of two plus (qualifier value),Two-plus out of two-plus present,This phrasing flips the order but still clearly expresses presence graded at 2+/2+. The concept is presence status with a quantified grade of two-plus out of a two-plus scale. Category: Qualifier value. It matches exactly the given code because it includes both essentials: 'present' and '2+ / 2+'. A parent 'Present' alone or a sibling 'Two-plus out of two-plus' without presence is less precise. The reordering does not change the meaning.
422813005,Document section (record artifact),Move this content to the document section,"The entry directs relocation of content into a 'document section,' matching SNOMED CT concept 422813005. The main concept is the document section structure, with category Record artifact. It does not name a specific section type or imply a different artifact. Parent or sibling concepts would be less precise, and children are excluded by the generic wording."
1345165001,Aspiration of foreign body into pharynx (event),ED triage note: foreign body aspirated into pharynx,"The ED triage context is meta-documentation and does not introduce clinical attributes. The core concept is a foreign body aspirated into the pharynx, exactly aligning with SCTID 1345165001 (Event). There are no added details like timing or severity. Parent concepts are broader, and sibling concepts naming other airway structures are excluded. It avoids suggesting persistent presence, so disorder/finding codes for pharyngeal foreign body are not preferred."
1352767002,Union for International Cancer Control ycT2b (qualifier value),UICC ycT2b value captured,"This indicates the capture of the UICC ycT2b classification, which is the clinical post-therapy T-category subclass b in the UICC TNM framework. The concept is a Qualifier value; SCTID 1352767002 is the correct code. Parents or siblings that alter subclass specificity or authority/timing (e.g., ycT2, AJCC ycT2b, UICC ypT2b) would not reflect the entry’s exact content."
215065003,Chondrectomy of foot and toe (procedure),Surgical excision of cartilage—foot/toe,"This states surgical excision of cartilage (i.e., chondrectomy) and constrains the site to foot/toe. As a Procedure, it corresponds to SNOMED CT 215065003. The entry avoids introducing approach (open/arthroscopic), laterality, joint-level detail, or extent, so it does not imply any child. It is more specific than a generic chondrectomy without site and does not suggest sibling concepts like chondroplasty (reshaping rather than excision)."
216450004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, railway line (environment)",Event location: rail line.,"The entry designates the event (accident or poisoning) location as a rail line, with no other details added. The main concept is the environment where the event occurred: the rail line (synonymous with railway line). SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (environment). This aligns exactly with 216450004 by specifying the railway line as the place of occurrence. More general parents lack the specificity, and siblings such as rail yard or station are not implied. Using “rail line” is a valid synonym that preserves the concept’s meaning."
276214006,Findings category type (qualifier value),Findings category type attribute,"Describing it as an attribute aligns with the Qualifier value role: it is the attribute that specifies the type of category for findings. This maps to SNOMED CT 276214006. The wording does not introduce any specific category values or clinical descriptors, so a parent qualifier would be too broad and a child would be too narrow. The selection remains uniquely codable to the intended qualifier value."
161456009,History of iron deficiency anemia (situation),History: IDA (iron-deficiency anemia),"The entry uses a common clinical abbreviation IDA, clarified as iron-deficiency anemia, with an explicit 'History:' marker, indicating a Situation of past disease. The correct SNOMED CT code is 161456009 (History of iron deficiency anemia), as it represents the historical status of the specific anemia subtype. Coding the disorder would imply current anemia. Broader history entries omit the iron deficiency detail, and sibling family history concepts are incorrect. The abbreviation 'IDA' is explicitly expanded here to avoid ambiguity, maintaining clinical equivalence without adding attributes."
421615004,Specimen from appendix obtained by appendectomy (specimen),Specimen—appendix; obtained by appendectomy,"The entry explicitly declares a specimen from the appendix and specifies it was obtained by appendectomy. Main concept: specimen; attributes: anatomical source (appendix) and acquisition method (appendectomy). Category: Specimen. This is the narrow concept required, not the broader parent without method, and it excludes siblings that represent different procurement methods such as biopsy or swab. The punctuation does not alter coding semantics."
444603008,Air sampling culture plate (physical object),Culture dish for air sampling,"The phrase indicates a culture dish intended for sampling air, a Physical object. It matches SCTID 444603008 because it specifies the object’s use (air sampling) without introducing procedural content or medium specifics. Parent objects (culture dish/plate) lack the air sampling specificity, and sibling or child concepts such as air samplers or settle plates are distinct objects or more specific methods. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and maintains code precision."
246030001,Entire C3-C4 intertransversarius cervicis anterior (body structure),Entire C3–C4 anterior intertransversarius muscle at the cervical spine,"The phrase identifies the entire anterior intertransversarius muscle at the C3–C4 cervical segment, with no lateralization or condition. Category: Body structure. SCTID 246030001 is appropriate because ‘entire’ matches the required whole-structure semantics and the level and anterior orientation are explicit. Broader parents or siblings (posterior or other levels) are excluded by the wording. Mentioning ‘cervical spine’ confirms location (cervicis) without altering the code intent."
279994001,Structure of scapular epiphysis (body structure),Anatomy: epiphysis of the scapula,"The content specifies the epiphysis of the scapula as the anatomical entity, which is a Body structure. This is a direct match to Structure of scapular epiphysis (279994001), with no additional attributes. Choosing a broader structure or a different bone part (physis or metaphysis) would be inaccurate for this wording. The paraphrase 'epiphysis of the scapula' is fully equivalent to 'scapular epiphysis' for coding purposes."
279053007,Sympathetically maintained pain (finding),The pain appears sympathetically maintained.,"This entry characterizes the pain as sympathetically maintained, expressing the Clinical finding without additional attributes. It maps to SNOMED CT Sympathetically maintained pain (SCTID 279053007). Although phrased as an observation, it does not introduce uncertainty qualifiers that would change the concept, nor does it add features like laterality or duration. Parent concepts like Pain are too general, and conditions like CRPS are not indicated."
773511004,Occupational therapy care plan (record artifact),Occupational therapy care plan record,"By stating 'care plan record,' the entry clearly identifies the artifact documenting the occupational therapy care plan. The concept is the OT care plan document and does not introduce extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The most precise code is Occupational therapy care plan (record artifact) [773511004]. Parent care plan artifacts are broader, and sibling therapy-specific care plans other than OT would be incorrect. The term 'record' aligns directly with the record artifact hierarchy."
224393001,Poor acceptance of authority at work (finding),Problems with accepting authority at work,"The wording identifies problems with acceptance of authority in the workplace, aligning with the intended concept. It is a Clinical finding and most precisely matches SCTID 224393001. 'Problems with accepting' is a paraphrase equivalent to poor acceptance, adding no extra attributes like severity or cause. General authority issues or other workplace findings would not be as exact a match."
14961000146107,Escherichia marmotae (organism),Escherichia marmotae,"The entry names the organism at the species level: Escherichia marmotae. The main concept is the taxonomic species itself without any added clinical attributes. In SNOMED CT this is an Organism concept, and Escherichia marmotae (organism) SCTID 14961000146107 is the exact, most specific match. Broader parents like Escherichia (organism) would be too general, and siblings such as Escherichia coli (organism) would be incorrect. No wording implies a finding, disease, site, or method, so the species-level organism code is the precise selection."
213007006,Multiple deprivation of child (event),Multiple deprivation affecting child,"The wording indicates the event of multiple deprivation and identifies the affected subject as a child, without introducing time, severity, or causes. This is an Event in SNOMED CT. Multiple deprivation of child (event) [213007006] is the precise match, as it encodes a child-specific multiple deprivation event. Using the generic Multiple deprivation (event) would be less specific, while child neglect or single deprivation concepts would misrepresent the content. The synonym ""affecting"" maintains equivalence to ""of child"" and does not change code selection."
271835004,Distension of abdomen caused by intestinal gas (finding),Abdominal distension caused by intestinal gas,"This wording directly matches the preferred term, articulating the abdominal distension finding and specifying intestinal gas as the cause. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 271835004 is exact. The parent 'Abdominal distension' is less precise without cause. Siblings like 'Abdominal bloating' lack explicit gas etiology, and 'Flatulence' is passage of gas rather than distension. No additional attributes are introduced beyond the cause included in the concept."
217706007,Bite of nonvenomous arthropod (event),Nonvenomous arthropod bite (event),"The entry explicitly states a bite by an arthropod with the qualifier nonvenomous and includes the term event, which aligns exactly with SNOMED CT concept 217706007 in the Event hierarchy. It describes the occurrence of the bite as an external cause, not a clinical disorder or injury finding. Parent concepts such as Arthropod bite (event) lack the nonvenomous qualifier, and child or sibling concepts that specify a particular arthropod type (e.g., insect, arachnid) would be too narrow. Disorder concepts like Insect bite (disorder) are inappropriate because they represent a clinical condition rather than the event that caused it. The wording is a direct synonym that maintains identical semantics."
404541005,"Salmonella IIIb 47:l,v:1,5,(7) (organism)","Salmonella 47:l,v:1,5,(7) (group IIIb serovar)","Providing the antigenic formula 47:l,v:1,5,(7) and stating it is a group IIIb serovar uniquely identifies the organism in question. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This is a precise synonym for the named SNOMED concept 404541005, avoiding any clinical attributes or context. Parent concepts would omit the serovar designation, and siblings are other serovars. The wording remains strictly taxonomic and organism-specific."
314872007,Prescription by nurse practitioner (situation),Nurse practitioner listed as prescriber on the prescription,"This record-oriented statement confirms the prescriber listed is a nurse practitioner. It is a Situation describing prescriber identity for a prescription. The phrasing aligns with Prescription by nurse practitioner (situation) and excludes other professional roles, making it more precise than parent concepts. The synonymy of ""listed as prescriber"" with ""authored/written by"" does not introduce additional attributes."
162363005,No ear discharge (situation),Denies ear discharge.,"This is a patient-reported negation of ear discharge, meaning the finding of otorrhea is absent. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context since it asserts a negative context to a finding. It maps most precisely to No ear discharge (situation) 162363005; using “denies” does not alter the clinical meaning of absence. Choosing a parent like general negative ROS or a sibling like Ear discharge (finding) would be inappropriate because this statement is specific and negated. No additional attributes (laterality, type, time) are present."
224029002,District of Northwest Territories (geographic location),District—Northwest Territories,"Using an em dash, this entry still expresses a district associated with the Northwest Territories, preserving the administrative level. No extra attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 224029002 fits best as it codes the district-level geographic concept for the Northwest Territories; broader territory codes or different administrative units would be inaccurate. The stylistic punctuation does not affect semantic equivalence."
182871005,Drug discontinued - patient fear/risk (situation),Discontinued pharmacotherapy attributable to patient fear/risk.,"This entry captures that pharmacotherapy was discontinued and attributes it to patient fear/risk. The concept is a SNOMED Situation describing a reason-qualified discontinuation. SCTID 182871005 is the precise code, more specific than a generic discontinuation and distinct from other reasons like adverse effects. The phrasing is synonymous and does not introduce additional details such as specific drug, timing, or severity."
119382000,Specimen from colon (specimen),Specimen origin: colon,"This entry denotes the specimen’s origin (source anatomical site) as the colon, with no added qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to 119382000 'Specimen from colon (specimen)' because the concept is a specimen and the site is colon. Parent concepts covering multiple GI sites are too general, and child concepts specifying exact material or extraction method are too narrow. Sibling sites are excluded by the word 'colon'."
706247001,Medical x-ray film (physical object),Clinical medical x-ray film,"This phrase identifies the physical x-ray film used in clinical care, emphasizing its medical application without adding other attributes. The main concept is a physical object, not a procedure or image, and no anatomy, laterality, or exposure details are included. It fits the Physical object category and matches Medical x-ray film (SCTID: 706247001). Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts representing images or devices (e.g., x-ray cassette) would be incorrect because the entry explicitly references the film medium. The synonym remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
700529001,Domestic floor mopping assistive device (physical object),Home-based floor mopping assistive device,"The wording describes an assistive device used for floor mopping in a home-based setting, maintaining domestic specificity. Category: Physical object. SCTID 700529001 aligns exactly as it is the assistive device for domestic floor mopping. More general assistive equipment or non-mopping tools would be less accurate, and non-assistive mops are different objects. The 'home-based' descriptor is equivalent to 'domestic' without adding attributes."
371535009,Transfer summary report (record artifact),Transfer summary documentation,"This phrase identifies the body of documentation constituting the transfer summary, which is synonymous with a transfer summary report as a record artifact. No additional attributes are introduced. Category: Record artifact. The best code is 371535009. Generic documentation or report parents would be too broad, and siblings such as operative or discharge reports do not match the transfer-of-care intent."
608968004,Microscopic examination of bacterial smear of specimen from integument (procedure),"Integument specimen bacterial smear, microscopic examination performed","The statement confirms that a microscopic examination was performed on a bacterial smear from an integument specimen. This is a Procedure and aligns with SCTID 608968004. The order of wording differs but conveys the same elements: microscopy, bacterial smear, integument source. No additional attributes (e.g., Gram stain or result) are added, ensuring precise mapping to this concept rather than to parent or child concepts."
302973007,Collision of motor-driven snow vehicle (event),Provider documentation: snowmobile collision,"This provider note captures a collision involving a snowmobile, which is the same as a collision of a motor-driven snow vehicle. The SNOMED CT category is Event; it maps to SCTID 302973007. There is no mention of what was struck, severity, time, or injury, avoiding child concepts. Using 'snowmobile' ensures specificity beyond generic vehicle collisions, keeping the code selection precise to the target."
224809004,Housing estate (environment),Environment: housing estate,"This entry directly labels the environmental context as 'housing estate', which is an Environment category concept in SNOMED CT. It does not broaden to general residential/urban areas nor narrow to specific estate subtypes. No extraneous attributes (severity, cause, time) are added. The exact match is Housing estate (environment), SCTID 224809004."
726643001,Ophthalmic interferometer (physical object),Patient mentions an “ophthalmic interferometer” by name,"A patient-reported context still references the device itself—an ophthalmic interferometer—without implying a particular procedure or function. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). The entry remains device-centric, more specific than a generic interferometer, and does not suggest a different subtype (e.g., OCT). Therefore, SCTID 726643001 is the correct, most precise code."
224656004,Chalet bungalow (environment),Social history – chalet bungalow,"The social history note identifies the housing environment as a chalet bungalow. The concept is strictly the dwelling type, with no extra attributes. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This is best coded as Chalet bungalow (environment) [224656004]; broader parents (e.g., residence) lack specificity, and siblings (e.g., apartment) would not match the explicit chalet bungalow wording."
439907006,Number of sick days off work in last month (observable entity),Number of days off work due to illness last month,"The entry specifies a numeric count of days, the context of work, the reason (illness/sickness), and the timeframe (last month), which together define the observable. This falls under the Observable entity category. It best maps to “Number of sick days off work in last month” because the phrase “due to illness” is equivalent to “sick” in occupational absence contexts and does not alter the attributes. More general parents (e.g., number of days off work) omit the sickness qualifier or the last-month window, and siblings with different periods (e.g., last week) or non-work contexts are not accurate matches."
214183001,Motor vehicle on road in collision with tram (event),Motor vehicle road collision with streetcar (tram),"This entry ensures clarity by including both 'streetcar' and '(tram),' and specifies a road collision with a motor vehicle. Category: Event. The redundancy does not alter attributes and confirms tram involvement, making SCTID 214183001 the best fit. More general motor vehicle collision codes would omit the tram detail, and more specific child codes by vehicle type are not warranted."
1222832009,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III:21 (qualifier value),Oncology follow-up note: AJCC stage III:21,"This entry sets a documentation context (“Oncology follow-up note”) and then states “AJCC stage III:21,” denoting the stage group III per AJCC. The main concept remains AJCC stage III; SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It appropriately maps to 1222832009 and does not introduce time-dependent status of the stage, tumor site, or substage. Parent or sibling concepts are not better fits, and child-level IIIA/B/C is not implied. The context label does not affect the qualifier value being conveyed."
768617009,Product containing naphthalene (product),Product labeled 'contains naphthalene',"The wording cites label language indicating that the product contains naphthalene, which directly describes the product’s ingredient without introducing dose, route, or use context. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and the precise code is “Product containing naphthalene (product)” SCTID 768617009. A parent concept like “Product containing substance” would be nonspecific, and sibling concepts for other substances would not match the labeling. A substance concept is inappropriate because the sentence is about a product per labeling, not the substance itself."
430703009,Family history of malignant neoplasm of kidney (situation),Family history significant for kidney malignancy.,"The entry documents that the family history is notable for a malignancy of the kidney, which is synonyms with malignant neoplasm of kidney. This is best represented by SNOMED CT 430703009 (Situation with explicit context: family history). No added attributes (relationship degree, laterality, type like RCC, or age) appear. Using broader concepts like family history of cancer is not as precise, and using narrower histologic or relative-specific concepts would add details absent from the statement. Therefore, the selected concept is the exact match for this wording."
232629006,Procedure for lung lesion (procedure),Patient-reported statement: procedure for lung lesion,"In patient-reported context, the concept still denotes a procedure for a lung lesion, corresponding to SNOMED CT 232629006. The main concept is procedural, focused on a lung lesion; no technique, timing, laterality, or lesion type is specified. Category: Procedure. Parent concepts omitting the lesion are too general, and technique-specific children like biopsy or excision are not supported. The contextual label (“patient-reported statement”) does not change the clinical meaning or coding."
441160005,Thermomonas haemolytica (organism),Named organism: Thermomonas haemolytica,"This entry identifies the organism by name as Thermomonas haemolytica, with no additional clinical attributes. It belongs to the Organism category, and the specific SNOMED CT code SCTID 441160005 is the best match. Parent concepts (genus or higher) are too general, and sibling species or different genera would misrepresent the named organism."
215301003,Knocked down by animal being ridden (event),Knocked down by animal being ridden,"The entry explicitly states that the person was knocked down by an animal that was being ridden, which matches the SNOMED CT concept 'Knocked down by animal being ridden (event)' (SCTID 215301003). The main medical concept is an external cause mechanism where a ridden animal knocks a person to the ground. Category: Event. This is the most precise match because it includes the essential attribute 'animal being ridden' and the specific outcome 'knocked down.' Broader parents like 'knocked down by animal' or siblings such as 'struck by animal' or 'fall from animal' would omit the 'being ridden' qualifier or introduce a different mechanism. The wording uses the exact phrasing of the preferred term and does not add any extra attributes such as location, severity, timing, species, or trampling."
887031000000108,Consent for information sharing (record artifact),Information-sharing consent,"The phrase is a noun form directly indicating a consent artifact specifically about information sharing, without extra attributes such as modality, recipient, or scope. The main concept is consent for information sharing, which belongs to the Record artifact semantic tag. It maps most accurately to 'Consent for information sharing (record artifact)' rather than broader consent artifacts or sibling concepts like research data-sharing consent or HIE-specific consent, which are not mentioned. The wording is synonymous with the preferred term and maintains the same semantic intent."
1366337005,Heating appliance in residence (finding),Environmental finding: heating appliance in patient’s residence,"This entry frames the presence of a heating appliance as an environmental finding at the patient’s residence, without specifying the device type, fuel, function, quantity, or exact location. The primary concept is a Clinical finding. The best SNOMED CT match is 'Heating appliance in residence (finding)'. Parent concepts describing general environmental or housing conditions would be overly broad, and child/sibling concepts naming specific heater types would be too narrow relative to the wording. The phrase mirrors the preferred term, keeping code selection precise."
371532007,Progress report (record artifact),Progress report included,"The artifact is a progress report, with a workflow descriptor (“included”) that does not change the document type. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 371532007 is appropriate since the document is explicitly a progress report. Parent concepts are overly general, and sibling document types are not indicated. The phrasing is consistent with the same concept without added attributes."
399721002,Tumor infiltration by lymphocytes present (finding),Lymphoid infiltration of tumor present,"The term 'lymphoid' here refers to lymphocytes and indicates their infiltration of the tumor is present. The concept is TIL presence, with no qualifiers such as degree or timing. It is a Clinical finding that aligns with SNOMED CT 399721002. Parent concepts that cover general inflammatory cell infiltration are too broad, and sibling concepts like 'absent lymphocyte infiltration' or other immune cell infiltrates do not match. The synonym 'lymphoid infiltration' is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
258210006,Double heterozygote (qualifier value),Double heterozygote per genetics report,"This entry references source context but the core concept remains the zygosity qualifier 'double heterozygote.' No additional clinical attributes (pathogenicity, gene names, timing) are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The phrase still aligns exactly with SCTID 258210006. Parent or sibling qualifiers (heterozygote, compound heterozygote) are less appropriate because the wording specifies heterozygosity at two separate loci."
770917007,Application of homeopathic topical agent to verruca plantaris (procedure),Use of homeopathic topical preparation on verruca plantaris,"This states that a homeopathic topical preparation was used on verruca plantaris, which represents the application procedure to a plantar wart. The concept falls under the SNOMED CT Procedure category. SCTID 770917007 is the most precise code as it includes both the homeopathic topical nature and the specific lesion. Parent codes such as ‘use of topical preparation’ or general wart therapy would be overly broad, and siblings like non-homeopathic topical treatments or cryotherapy would be incorrect. ‘Preparation’ is a synonym for ‘agent’ and ‘verruca plantaris’ is equivalent to ‘plantar wart,’ maintaining the exact concept."
174712007,Excision of tail of pancreas and drainage of pancreatic duct (procedure),"The tail of the pancreas was removed, and the pancreatic duct was drained",This narrative statement describes removal (excision) of the pancreatic tail and drainage of the pancreatic duct. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It matches SCTID 174712007 exactly and does not introduce details that would suggest a different or broader code. Concepts that include only one component or that specify distal/left pancreatectomy are less precise. The synonyms 'removed' for excision and 'drained' for drainage are standard and maintain the same coding target.
278405008,Subtype serogroup (qualifier value),Subtype serogroup,"The main concept stated is “Subtype serogroup,” which denotes the qualifier used to express a subtype within a serogroup classification. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value. It precisely matches SCTID 278405008 because it refers to the specific qualifier for serogroup subtyping, not the broader serogroup or an alternate scheme like serotype. A parent concept such as “Serogroup (qualifier value)” would be too general and omit the subtype refinement. Sibling concepts like “Serotype (qualifier value)” represent a different antigenic classification and are not appropriate. No organism, method, severity, or temporal attributes are introduced, preserving the intended qualifier semantics."
122044003,Measurement of Mycoplasma gallisepticum antibody (procedure),Mycoplasma gallisepticum antibody measurement,"The entry explicitly describes measuring antibodies directed against Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which matches the procedure concept. Category: Procedure. SCTID 122044003 is the most precise because it specifies antibody measurement for this organism. Broader parents like “Measurement of antibody” are too generic and do not indicate the target organism, while siblings for other species (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody measurement) would be incorrect. No extra attributes (method, isotype, specimen, timing) are introduced, so the wording remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
52799000,Electromagnetic radiation in radio wave region (physical force),RF electromagnetic radiation,"This uses the common abbreviation 'RF' for radiofrequency and refers to electromagnetic radiation, thereby denoting the radio wave spectral region. No additional attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, with SCTID 52799000 as the precise code. Parent concepts like Electromagnetic radiation are overly broad, and sibling concepts such as infrared or microwave are different spectral ranges. The abbreviation does not change meaning; it is a clinically equivalent synonym of the preferred term and remains uniquely codable to the radio wave EM radiation concept."
416575001,Perioperative record (record artifact),Perioperative record available in the file,"The phrase indicates the presence of the perioperative record in a file, maintaining focus on the artifact itself. The category is Record artifact, and the term clearly denotes the perioperative period rather than a single component like an operative note. Hence, 416575001 Perioperative record (record artifact) is the best fit. Using a generic parent artifact would be too broad, and selecting a sibling (e.g., Postoperative note) would be mismatched given the comprehensive perioperative designation."
1229987008,American Joint Committee on Cancer cN3c (qualifier value),Patient statement: 'AJCC cN3c',"Even as a patient-reported line, the content 'AJCC cN3c' directly refers to the AJCC clinical nodal category cN3c, with no added attributes. The core concept is AJCC cN3c; in SNOMED CT this is a Qualifier value matched by SCTID 1229987008. Broader parent terms (AJCC cN unspecified, AJCC N3) or siblings (cN3a/cN3b, pN3c) are not supported by the exact cN3c wording. The quoted format does not alter the meaning or specificity of the staging value."
11055001,Injection of anesthetic agent into facial nerve (procedure),Anesthesia record: injection into facial nerve with anesthetic agent,"An anesthesia record entry describing an injection into the facial nerve of an anesthetic agent directly reflects the Procedure “Injection of anesthetic agent into facial nerve” (11055001). Parent categories that omit the site or specify only cranial/peripheral nerve are less precise; sibling procedures for other nerves or techniques are not exact. The wording maintains the concept’s scope without adding timing, laterality, or method attributes."
411623001,Anethum graveolens diagnostic allergen extract (product),Anethum graveolens test allergen extract (diagnostic use),"Describes an allergen extract from Anethum graveolens intended for diagnostic testing, i.e., a test allergen. It conveys a product for diagnosis and avoids specifying administration or concentration. SNOMED CT category: Product. The wording is a clinically safe synonym for a diagnostic allergen extract, making SCTID 411623001 the most precise match. Broader allergen extract concepts lack species specificity, and therapeutic/allergen immunotherapy extracts are excluded by the stated diagnostic use."
1255634003,Military hospital (environment),Military hospital,"The entry denotes a hospital operated by a military organization, which matches the SNOMED CT concept Military hospital (environment) SCTID 1255634003. It expresses an environmental setting without adding attributes like timing, severity, or branch of service. The correct semantic tag is environment (Environment or geographical location). A broader parent such as Hospital (environment) would lose the specific military qualifier, while children or siblings like Field hospital (environment) or Veterans hospital would add specificity not stated here. Therefore, this exact concept and code are the most precise match."
36125001,Trauma center (environment),Trauma centre,"This is the British spelling of the same environment, conveying the identical concept without any added qualifiers. The main concept is a trauma center setting; there are no attributes regarding level, specialty, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (environment). It maps directly to Trauma center (environment) [36125001]. More general concepts (e.g., Hospital environment) are too broad, and more specific concepts (e.g., Pediatric trauma center) would be inappropriate because no such qualifiers are present."
735327001,Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy care plan (record artifact),EGD care plan,"EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is a clinically accepted synonym for upper GI endoscopy. The entry is a documented care plan, not an order, request, or completion. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and 735327001 precisely represents a care plan for upper GI endoscopy. Using the synonym EGD does not introduce new attributes; it remains semantically equivalent to upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy. More general care plan artifacts or procedure concepts would be less appropriate given the explicit plan-of-care context."
37427006,Structure of lateral femoral cutaneous vein (body structure),Anatomy reviewed—lateral femoral cutaneous vein,"This note states that the lateral femoral cutaneous vein was reviewed, naming only the anatomical vein and adding no attributes such as laterality or pathology. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. Parent concepts like 'vein structure' are overly broad, and siblings like 'lateral femoral circumflex vein' or the nerve are distinct. The review context is neutral regarding coding, so SCTID 37427006 is the precise match."
16216091000119108,Duodenal brushings specimen (specimen),Laboratory submission: duodenal brushings specimen,"This describes a submission to the lab of a specimen comprising duodenal brushings, specifying site and acquisition method. It is a direct match to 'Duodenal brushings specimen' in the Specimen category. Concepts that are broader (e.g., duodenal specimen without method) or that use different techniques (biopsy, aspirate) are not as precise. The contextual phrase 'Laboratory submission' does not alter the semantics relevant to coding."
736656004,Arthrographis arxii (organism),Patient states the organism name “Arthrographis arxii”,"A patient-reported mention of the organism name does not introduce presence, disease, or site; it simply references the species Arthrographis arxii. This maps to the organism concept in SNOMED CT (Organism, 736656004). Coding to a parent like Arthrographis genus or to any infection-related concept would be inappropriate because no such attributes are present. The phrase is a synonymic context around the same organism."
32849002,Esophageal structure (body structure),Anatomical focus: esophagus,"This entry indicates the esophagus as the anatomical focus, consistent with a Body structure reference. The precise SNOMED CT mapping is Esophageal structure (body structure), SCTID 32849002. It does not introduce any pathologic or procedural attributes or specify subparts. Parent concepts such as alimentary tract are broader than needed, and child concepts like esophagogastric junction or esophageal mucosa are not appropriate because they are more specific. The phrasing is context-only and clinically equivalent to naming the esophageal structure."
60209000,Anoplocephala magna (organism),Anoplocephala magna (helminth),"The entry includes a general classification 'helminth' while naming the exact species Anoplocephala magna, which is a taxonomic qualifier rather than a clinical attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Organism; the correct code is Anoplocephala magna (organism), SCTID 60209000. Concepts like 'Helminths' or 'Cestoda' are too broad, and genus-level or sibling species would be less precise. The helminth descriptor is clinically equivalent classification, not altering the organism code selection."
1306622005,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Clinical facial photo (extraoral): right half face with lips relaxed and jaws in centric relation.,"This phrasing denotes a clinical extraoral facial photograph of the right half, including the specified lip posture and jaw relationship. The main concept remains a record artifact image. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The details directly match the concept’s defining attributes, making SCTID 1306622005 the most precise fit. Parent concepts lacking right-half or posture details and siblings such as intraoral or different facial views would be incorrect. “Clinical facial photo (extraoral)” is synonymous with “photographic extraoral image” and maintains equivalence."
227952007,Tomato stuffed with rice (substance),"Tomato, stuffed with rice","This punctuation variant explicitly states a tomato that is stuffed with rice, which is semantically equivalent to SNOMED CT 227952007 Tomato stuffed with rice (substance). The category is Substance. The entry focuses solely on the composition and avoids additional qualifiers such as preparation time or dietary restrictions. Broader parents like prepared tomato or stuffed vegetable lack the rice detail, and alternative stuffing siblings are excluded. Hence, 227952007 is the precise match."
223858008,Isles du Salut (geographic location),Event location documented as Îles du Salut,The essential concept is the geographic location Îles du Salut; 'event location' merely situates context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This maps directly to Isles du Salut (geographic location) SCTID 223858008; selecting a parent or child geographic entity would misrepresent the specified location. No additional qualifiers alter the place being named.
1078221007,Abnormal number of permanent teeth (finding),Problem list: abnormal number of permanent teeth,"Listed as a problem, the entry conveys an abnormal number of teeth specifically in the permanent dentition, mapping to Abnormal number of permanent teeth (finding) SCTID 1078221007. The main concept is a count abnormality confined to permanent teeth, with no added attributes. Category: Clinical finding. The broader parent concept including all dentitions is less precise, and child concepts for missing or extra permanent teeth are too specific because the entry does not indicate directionality. The wording mirrors the preferred term in a problem-list context."
216362004,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, football field (environment)",Incident location (external cause): football field,"The entry documents the incident’s external cause location as a football field, which fits SNOMED CT 216362004 (environment). It avoids details beyond place-of-occurrence. Parent concepts like general external cause location or sports area lack specificity; sibling environments are not referenced. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and maintains the same code."
705377002,Audiovisual device (physical object),Audio-visual device flagged in chart,"The concept is an audio-visual device; 'flagged in chart' is documentation context rather than a device attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The hyphenated form is a synonym of audiovisual device, mapping to SCTID 705377002. Parent device codes would be overly broad, whereas specific AV equipment or single-modality devices would misrepresent the general audiovisual nature expressed here."
362568003,Entire macula of utricle (body structure),Patient inquiry term: entire macula of the utricle,"The phrase presents the anatomical term a patient inquires about, explicitly the entire macula of the utricle; “entire” confirms completeness. The concept is a Body structure and fits SCTID 362568003. Parent concepts lacking completeness are broader and less precise, while siblings like the saccular macula or the retinal macula are different anatomical entities. The context of patient inquiry does not introduce attributes beyond naming the whole structure."
27398004,Omentum structure (body structure),Patient handout topic: omentum,"Patient-education context still names the omentum, referring strictly to the anatomical structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The most precise match remains Omentum structure (body structure) [27398004]; no greater/lesser component or abnormal attribute is implied. Broader peritoneal structures or other abdominal structures would be less specific, and child concepts are not supported."
609193006,Endoscopic excision of tissue of urethra (procedure),Surgeon’s note: endoscopic removal of urethral tissue,"Main concept: excisional removal of urethral tissue using endoscopic technique, as stated in a surgeon’s note. Attributes: method (endoscopic), action (removal/excision), site (urethral tissue). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The term “removal” here refers to excision of native tissue, aligning with SCTID 609193006. Parent procedures that omit endoscopy are less specific, and sibling procedures like foreign body removal or biopsy would not fit the described native tissue excision."
286631004,Ultraviolet A radiation (physical force),Ultraviolet A component of ultraviolet radiation,"The entry expresses UVA radiation as the A component within the ultraviolet spectrum, which is a definitional description. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. This is narrower than the parent “Ultraviolet radiation” and excludes UVB/UVC siblings. No attributes such as exposure, source, or intensity are introduced, so Ultraviolet A radiation is the precise code."
729773002,Entire radial collateral ligament of interphalangeal joint of thumb (body structure),Identified structure—radial collateral ligament of thumb’s interphalangeal joint,"This entry denotes recognition of the anatomical target: the radial collateral ligament of the thumb interphalangeal joint, a Body structure. The core concept is the same as SCTID 729773002 (entire RCL of thumb IP). The meta phrase 'Identified structure' does not add diagnostic, procedural, or laterality attributes. Parent concepts without 'radial' are too broad, and sibling terms like 'ulnar collateral ligament' are excluded. Mentioning the ligament inherently refers to it in its entirety for coding purposes."
466656001,Wheelchair crutch/walking stick holder (physical object),DME: holder on wheelchair for cane or crutch,"This line lists a durable medical equipment item that is a holder on a wheelchair intended for a cane or crutch. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). Wheelchair crutch/walking stick holder (466656001) precisely captures this object, combining wheelchair context with dual-purpose holder capability. A broader DME listing or general mobility aid holder would be less specific, and single-function holders would be narrower. The DME context does not introduce additional attributes that would change code selection."
314789007,Diagnostic imaging equipment (physical object),Diagnostic imaging equipment noted in report,"Report context is incidental; the entry still denotes the physical object class of diagnostic imaging equipment. Category: Physical object. The match is “Diagnostic imaging equipment (physical object)” SCTID 314789007. It does not specify a modality or usage event, preventing misassignment to procedural concepts or specific device children. Parent imaging equipment without the diagnostic qualifier is less precise than this wording."
165251008,Walking aid use (observable entity),Reports using a gait aid,"The patient-reported statement reflects the observable use of a gait aid, a clinically equivalent term for walking aid. The concept is an Observable entity and does not introduce diagnosis, procedure, or specific device type. It is appropriately narrower than general mobility aid use and does not fit child/sibling codes that name particular devices. Therefore, 'Walking aid use (observable entity)' SCTID 165251008 is the most accurate selection."
298699009,Head compression test negative (finding),Provider documented head compression test as negative.,"This is a documentation context confirming the head compression test is negative. The concept remains the negative result of the specific test, making SCTID 298699009 the most precise Clinical finding code. It avoids broader or different test concepts and does not add extra attributes like severity or associated conditions."
257643004,Freeway access ramp (environment),Context: freeway access ramp,"This concise entry records the contextual environment as 'freeway access ramp' with no modifiers. The main concept is an environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It maps directly to SCTID 257643004. Choosing a broader parent such as 'transport environment' would lose specificity, and selecting a child like 'freeway off-ramp' would add a direction not present in the text. The word 'context' is a documentation wrapper only."
11595007,Structure of transverse antihelicine sulcus (body structure),Label: transverse antihelicine sulcus,"The content simply labels the anatomical structure by its proper name, introducing no clinical findings or laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and the best match is 'Structure of transverse antihelicine sulcus' (11595007). Parent concepts such as 'Structure of auricle' are overly broad, and sibling structures (e.g., scapha or triangular fossa) refer to different features. This entry does not imply any modification or attribute, avoiding child concept selection, so 11595007 is the precise code."
51372003,Blood group antibody An^a^ (substance),Follow-up note: review of An^a^ antibody,"The entry references reviewing the An^a^ antibody, which denotes the substance without adding attributes like detection status, titer, or effect. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; the best match is Blood group antibody An^a^ (SCTID 51372003). Parent concepts are nonspecific, and sibling concepts concern antibodies to other antigens. This does not correspond to a finding or observable test result."
370921009,Patient death associated with a fall while being cared for in a healthcare facility (event),Case review notes death associated with a fall during healthcare facility care.,"This case review statement captures the required components: death, association with a fall, and occurrence during care in a healthcare facility. It aligns exactly with the Event SCTID 370921009. The entry refrains from specifying particular facility types or causal certainty, and it avoids introducing injuries or timing details. It is therefore more precise than broader parent concepts and not merely a fall event (sibling). Synonyms are clinically equivalent."
214439004,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving fall down stairs of motor bus while boarding or alighting, motor cyclist injured (event)",Injury circumstance: noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident with fall down motor bus stairs during alighting; motorcyclist injured.,"This phrasing delineates a noncollision traffic accident, the mechanism (fall down bus stairs), the activity (alighting), and the injured person (motorcyclist). SNOMED CT 214439004 (Event) specifically covers this combination. Parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling concepts—such as those specifying collision or indicating a different victim category—would not match. The synonyms used ('motor bus stairs', 'alighting') are equivalent to the preferred terms and do not add extra attributes, ensuring correct code selection."
223887009,Lancashire (geographic location),"Lancashire (England, geographic location)","The entry explicitly states Lancashire’s country and semantic tag, aligning with SNOMED’s location hierarchy. The principal concept is the geographic place Lancashire. Category: Location, semantic tag geographic location; code: Lancashire (geographic location) SCTID 223887009. Mention of England is definitional and does not warrant coding to the parent. No child subregions or sibling counties are named. No clinical attributes (residence, birth, procedures) are introduced, so the Lancashire place concept is the exact match."
82996008,Social status (social concept),Social rank,"‘Social rank’ is an equivalent expression for social status, indicating position in the social hierarchy without specifying level or related determinants. The concept belongs to Social context (social concept). SCTID 82996008 best fits because the term denotes the general attribute of social standing. Selecting parent concepts would be overly broad, and choosing children/siblings (like marital status or employment status) would introduce specificity not present in the entry. The synonym does not change code selection."
405118000,Knowledge level: procedure (observable entity),Observable: procedure knowledge level,"This entry directly frames the concept as an observable and identifies its topic domain as procedures. The main concept is the data element for procedure-related knowledge level, classified under Observable entity. SCTID 405118000 is the most specific match. A parent observable not constrained to procedures would be less accurate, and topic-specific siblings (e.g., disease or medication knowledge level) would be wrong for this wording. The label ‘Observable’ simply clarifies the category and does not introduce results or methods."
260341007,8 o'clock position (qualifier value),Patient indicates the 8 o'clock position,"This patient-centered phrasing describes a clockface positional reference at 8 o'clock, without detailing any symptom or anatomical location; it remains a pure qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 260341007 is the most accurate code for the stated position. A parent concept like 'Clock position' lacks specificity, and alternative clock positions would be incorrect siblings. The verb 'indicates' does not add clinical attributes; it only conveys the chosen positional qualifier."
242917002,Assault with whip (event),Assault—whip used,"The entry specifies an assault and explicitly notes the use of a whip, without adding attributes like severity or context. This fits the Event category and aligns with “Assault with whip (event)” (SCTID: 242917002). Using a parent assault code would omit the critical mechanism attribute, and other weapon-related assault concepts would misrepresent the event. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent paraphrase indicating the same concept."
447376003,Debulking of neoplasm of spinal cord (procedure),Intraoperative note: debulking of spinal cord tumor,"The intraoperative documentation describes debulking of a tumor of the spinal cord, specifying partial removal to reduce tumor burden. As a Procedure with site and neoplasm defined, the best SNOMED CT match is Debulking of neoplasm of spinal cord (447376003). Parent concepts are too general, and siblings such as total excision, biopsy, or decompression would not match the explicit term “debulking.” The note’s context does not introduce extra attributes; it clearly denotes the same procedure."
787124000,Entire blood vessel of abdomen proper (body structure),Target anatomy: blood vessel of the proper abdomen,"The entry indicates the anatomical target as a blood vessel located in the proper abdomen, without introducing vessel type or clinical condition. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It corresponds to SCTID 787124000 by naming the entire blood vessel entity within the abdomen proper. A parent like “blood vessel of abdomen” lacks the specific regional qualifier, while children such as named abdominal vessels would be too specific. The phrase “proper abdomen” is a direct synonym of “abdomen proper” and does not alter the anatomical scope, ensuring the same code applies."
257608000,Factory premises (environment),Manufacturing facility premises,"A manufacturing facility is another accepted synonym for a factory, and 'premises' denotes the physical environment. No additional attributes are introduced. The category is Environment. Using a broader parent like 'Workplace (environment)' or 'Industrial premises' would lose specificity. Sibling environments (office, warehouse) are not intended, and no child-level detail is indicated. Therefore, 'Factory premises (environment)' is the most accurate coding."
135231000119103,Intranasal influenza vaccination given (situation),Immunization record notes: intranasal influenza vaccination given.,"The entry indicates the immunization record documents that an influenza vaccination was given via the intranasal route, confirming completion. Concepts: influenza vaccination, intranasal route, performed situation. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 135231000119103 is the exact code, as it encodes a given intranasal influenza vaccination. A parent code without route would be less specific, and siblings with different routes would not match. The documentation context does not change the clinical meaning; “given” preserves the performed status with the specified route."
66205002,Injection of gas (procedure),Discharge summary: underwent injection of gas,"This states the patient underwent a procedure where gas was injected, with no site, gas type, or indication specified. It is a Procedure. The correct SNOMED CT code is 66205002 Injection of gas (procedure). More general parent concepts lose the key detail about the injected material, and siblings involving other methods (insufflation/inhalation) are mismatched. The discharge context simply confirms occurrence and is consistent with the same procedure code."
250958006,Right ventricular appearance (observable entity),Appearance—right ventricle,"This terse format still expresses the observable appearance of the right ventricle and adds no further characteristics. Main concept: right ventricular appearance. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 250958006 applies directly. Parent concepts are too general; children/siblings such as outflow tract appearance, wall appearance, or dimensional measures are not indicated. The dash formatting is stylistic and does not change semantic content."
257741005,Anastomosis - action (qualifier value),Surgical action = anastomosis,"This documentation-style statement sets 'anastomosis' specifically as the surgical action. It conveys only the action without procedure outcomes, anatomy, or technique subtype. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, matching 257741005. Selecting a procedure concept would be inappropriate because the entry is capturing a method attribute, not a procedure entity. Parent 'Action' lacks specificity; siblings (e.g., ligation, excision) are different actions. The equality form does not change the concept and remains equivalent to the action qualifier."
1561000175106,Every hour as required (qualifier value),Order frequency: hourly as needed,"This order-level statement uses “hourly” for every hour and “as needed” for PRN. It defines a frequency qualifier. The concept is a Qualifier value, precisely matching SNOMED CT 1561000175106. Parents like “hourly” or “as needed” alone miss one attribute; siblings change the interval. No extra clinical details are included."
464210001,Thermographic camera (physical object),Thermographic camera unit,"The phrasing denotes a unit that is a thermographic camera, still referring to the same physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It matches Thermographic camera (physical object), SCTID 464210001, rather than parent or sibling concepts, as it specifies the exact device type. Using 'unit' does not introduce new attributes; it is a generic way to refer to the camera hardware. More general camera terms or thermal imaging systems would be less precise."
122648004,Specimen from colon obtained by right hemicolectomy (specimen),Accession entry: colon specimen from right hemicolectomy,"This accession note states colon specimen and right hemicolectomy procurement, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 122648004 in the Specimen hierarchy. It excludes disease, segment, or alternative procedures, making parent terms too vague and sibling concepts mismatched. The phrasing is a documentation variant but clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
223621005,Australia (geographic location),Australia (country),"The entry explicitly clarifies that Australia is referenced at the country level, reinforcing it as a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). The best code is Australia (geographic location), SCTID 223621005. This avoids mapping to a continent-level notion or subregions. Parent categories (e.g., 'Country') are too general, while children like states or localities are too specific, and siblings are other countries."
304934008,Structure of radial collateral ligament of distal interphalangeal joint of middle finger (body structure),"Radial collateral ligament, DIP joint, third digit","The entry identifies the radial collateral ligament at the DIP joint of the third digit (middle finger), making the structure clear. It is an anatomical Body structure and corresponds to SCTID 304934008. Parent concepts without digit specification and siblings involving the ulnar collateral ligament or different joints are less appropriate. “Third digit” is a standard synonym for middle finger and does not change the code selection."
16215051000119107,Specimen from labia obtained by biopsy (specimen),Labia biopsy sample for pathology,"This indicates a sample intended for pathology, specifying it as a labia biopsy. The concept is a Specimen, with site (labia) and method (biopsy). It corresponds to “Specimen from labia obtained by biopsy” (16215051000119107). Parent concepts missing the labial site or overly broad anatomical areas are less accurate, and child concepts adding subsite or laterality are not supported. The phrase “for pathology” is contextual and does not change the specimen type."
328123005,Phenylketonuria food (product),Supply: phenylketonuria food,"The entry lists a supply item of food for phenylketonuria, clearly a product. It corresponds to 'Phenylketonuria food (product)' [328123005] in the Product hierarchy. The supply context is administrative and does not add clinical attributes (composition, age, form), avoiding misclassification to child products or dietary findings."
224046004,Delaware (geographic location),State of Delaware,"The phrase “State of Delaware” directly denotes the U.S. state as a geographic entity. Main concept: Delaware as a state-level geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. This wording is a clinically safe synonym of the preferred term and maps precisely to SCTID 224046004. It does not add attributes like residence or event context; it avoids ambiguity with other entities such as Delaware River or Delaware County. Parent concepts (e.g., United States of America) would be broader, and sibling states would be incorrect."
69803003,Detonation (physical force),Detonation acknowledged,"Acknowledgment of detonation references the physical force itself and adds no specifics about source, severity, or injuries. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, with Detonation (physical force) [69803003] being the most accurate code. More general parents or alternative siblings such as Blast would be less precise. The acknowledgment context is neutral and preserves equivalence."
285666008,Decrease in pressure (physical force),Pressure lowering,"“Pressure lowering” conveys ongoing reduction of physical pressure, which is semantically equivalent to a decrease in pressure and maps to 285666008. Category: Physical force (event). It does not specify domain, context, or severity, ensuring it remains within the general physical-force decrease rather than a more specific child or a sibling concept."
223911004,English islands (geographic location),English isles,"This synonym uses the adjective “English” to specify the insular territories belonging to England, equivalent to “Islands of England.” SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). It fits SCTID 223911004, not a parent (England generally) nor a sibling (e.g., Scottish islands). It does not narrow to a single island or expand to UK-wide or non-English island groups, preserving precise scope."
215255001,Thrown from animal-drawn vehicle (event),"Patient states: ""I was thrown from the horse-drawn buggy.""","A patient-reported statement that they were thrown from a horse-drawn buggy unambiguously describes the Event 'Thrown from animal-drawn vehicle' (215255001). The use of 'thrown' is exact and no extra attributes (e.g., collision, location, injuries, timing) are provided, making parent codes too broad and any child/sibling concepts inappropriate."
91646005,Gibberish aphasia (finding),Follow-up note: gibberish aphasia,"In follow-up documentation, the finding remains gibberish aphasia. The category is Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 91646005 is the precise code because the subtype is specified. Although the context is follow-up, no temporal attributes (e.g., resolved, chronic) are stated, and no alternate aphasia type or causative details are introduced."
445529007,Hemodialysate specimen from hemodialysis machine using water distribution system (specimen),Specimen type: hemodialysate from HD machine with water distribution feed,"The phrase indicates the specimen type is hemodialysate and that the source is a hemodialysis machine fed by a water distribution system, without adding extra clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and SCTID 445529007 is the precise match because it encodes hemodialysate specimen from a machine using a water distribution system. Selecting a parent like “Hemodialysate specimen” would omit the feed detail, and a sibling referring to alternative water supplies would not fit. “Water distribution feed” is a synonymous expression for water distribution system supply."
223598004,Bangladesh (geographic location),"Bangladesh, the country","This wording explicitly clarifies that the reference is to the country Bangladesh, adding no clinical or relational attributes. The main concept is Bangladesh as a geographic place. The SNOMED category is Geographic location. It is neither broader (e.g., Asia) nor narrower (e.g., Dhaka), making Bangladesh (geographic location) [223598004] the exact and most specific match."
223769000,Negros (geographic location),Isla de Negros,"This is the Spanish-language synonym for 'Negros Island,' still representing the same geographic location. The category is Geographic location (Location), and the correct code is Negros (geographic location) SCTID 223769000. Language variation does not introduce attributes or change granularity. It is not the broader Philippines nor the narrower provinces like Negros Oriental/Occidental; therefore, the island concept is the precise match."
782161000,Bite (event),Intake note: bite (event),"The intake context documents ""bite (event)"" explicitly, indicating the occurrence rather than any resultant injury. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This matches SCTID 782161000 Bite (event) exactly, with no added attributes like source, site, or severity. Choosing a disorder or a more specific event (e.g., human bite) would require stated details not present in the entry."
369432006,Structure of vagus nerve parasympathetic fibers to cardiac plexus (body structure),Vagal contribution to cardiac plexus (parasympathetic fibers) — structure,"This documentation-style entry clarifies the anatomical contribution of vagal parasympathetic fibers to the cardiac plexus. It is clearly a Body structure. It avoids laterality and detailed sub-branching, ensuring it does not map to a child concept. It is not a better fit for sibling plexus contributions, making SCTID 369432006 the precise code."
304304009,Increased range of wrist movement (finding),Increased range of wrist movement,"The entry explicitly identifies a wrist-specific increase in range of motion, which is a Clinical finding. This aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 304304009, “Increased range of wrist movement (finding).” It localizes the finding to the wrist and describes the attribute as increased range, without introducing laterality, cause, severity, or specific planes of motion. More general parent concepts like “Increased range of joint movement” lack the wrist specificity, and sibling or child concepts (e.g., instability, laxity, or increased extension only) would be incorrect because no specific mechanism or direction is stated. The wording is a direct, semantically equivalent statement of the concept."
277460003,World Health Organization central nervous system tumor grading system (staging scale),WHO CNS tumor grading system documented,"The phrase indicates documentation of the WHO CNS tumor grading system, focusing on the scale itself rather than any grade assignment. It introduces no tumor-specific or temporal attributes beyond acknowledging the scale, which remains the core concept. In SNOMED CT, this is a Staging scale (assessment scale) and maps to SCTID 277460003. General parent staging scales lack specificity, and child grade categories would be inappropriate because no grade value is provided. The added verb “documented” does not change the concept being referenced."
217517006,"Accident caused by clothes on fire from controlled fire, not in building or structure, from bonfire (event)","Accidental clothing ignition at supervised, controlled bonfire (outside, not in a building)","This statement indicates an accidental ignition of clothing from a supervised, controlled bonfire, and specifies the location as outside (not in a building). The primary concept is the external cause Event of clothing catching fire at a controlled bonfire outdoors. SCTID 217517006 is the most precise match because it requires accident, clothing on fire, controlled fire, open-air setting, and bonfire origin. A more general parent missing the bonfire qualifier or a sibling such as “campfire” or “barbecue” would be less appropriate. “Supervised” and “controlled” are clinically equivalent in this context, reaffirming control of the fire without introducing new attributes."
118363003,Orange laser light (physical force),Orange laser light documented,"This entry reflects a record noting orange laser light, without specifying any device class, power, or timing. The main concept is the physical force of orange laser light. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and SCTID 118363003 is the precise match. Broader parent concepts or device-related siblings are not signaled by the wording."
432436003,Specimen from hydrocele of spermatic cord (specimen),"Received: specimen, hydrocele of spermatic cord","This is a receipt/log-style documentation stating a specimen was received and identifies its origin as hydrocele of the spermatic cord. As a Specimen, the exact match is Specimen from hydrocele of spermatic cord (432436003). Parent concepts that only mention hydrocele or spermatic cord separately are not sufficiently specific, and sibling concepts for different hydrocele sites would be inaccurate. No procurement method, side, or timing details are introduced, keeping the coding focused on the specimen origin."
218031003,Accident caused by electric sewing machine (event),Device-related accident: electric sewing machine,"This entry frames the event as a device-related accident and specifies the device as an electric sewing machine, which exactly maps to 'Accident caused by electric sewing machine (event)' SCTID 218031003. Main concept: accident event; attribute: device cause—electric sewing machine. SNOMED CT category: Event. Without naming the device, 'Device-related accident' would be too general (parent), but inclusion of the specific electric sewing machine makes it precise. It does not introduce injury characteristics or timing, so child injury concepts are excluded. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent."
294392004,Allergy to mefloquine (finding),Allergic to mefloquine,"The phrase states the patient is allergic to mefloquine, which is exactly the content of Allergy to mefloquine (finding), SCTID 294392004. It represents a Clinical finding about hypersensitivity to a specific drug without adding other attributes (no severity, reaction, or timing). Parent concepts like generic Drug allergy would be too broad, and sibling concepts such as Adverse reaction to mefloquine or Intolerance are less appropriate because the term 'allergic' specifically denotes immunologic allergy. This paraphrase is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not change code selection."
226389005,Fruit juice intake (observable entity),Patient reports fruit juice intake,"This patient-reported statement communicates the observable intake of fruit juice. Category: Observable entity. No frequency, amount, or timing is stated, and the content specifically mentions fruit juice, not other beverages or foods. Thus, Fruit juice intake SCTID 226389005 is the most precise match, avoiding parent or sibling concepts."
284118008,Does control shoulder girdle posture (finding),Able to control shoulder girdle posture.,"This statement describes the patient’s capability to control shoulder girdle posture, aligning exactly with the affirmative finding embodied by “Does control shoulder girdle posture (finding)” (SCTID 284118008). Main concept: positive control of shoulder girdle posture; attributes: none beyond affirmative ability. Category: Clinical finding. It does not introduce extent, severity, laterality, timing, or associated conditions. A broader parent concept about general ability to control posture would be less specific, and a sibling concept indicating lack of control would be incorrect. The phrase “able to control” is a clinically safe synonym for “does control,” preserving equivalence and appropriate code selection."
285403007,Mechanical compression (physical force),Compressive loading (mechanical),"‘Compressive loading’ is a commonly used engineering/clinical synonym for mechanical compression and indicates a compressive mechanical force without adding new attributes. The category is Physical force, and the best match is Mechanical compression (physical force) SCTID 285403007. The parent Mechanical force is too generic; siblings such as shear, tension/traction, or torsion are distinct modalities. No clinical finding or procedural context is asserted, so a physical force code is correct."
1141620004,Line-powered intraocular lens injector (physical object),Line-powered intraocular lens injector,"The main concept is a device specifically designed to inject an intraocular lens and explicitly described as line-powered. In SNOMED CT, this is a Physical object and matches precisely the concept “Line-powered intraocular lens injector” (SCTID 1141620004). The wording includes both the device function (intraocular lens injector) and the power source attribute (line-powered), which distinguishes it from broader parent concepts like an intraocular lens injector without specified power, and from sibling devices such as battery-powered or manual injectors. No additional attributes (e.g., sterility, brand, disposability) are introduced, so this exact code is the most appropriate."
3525006,Humidity (physical force),Humidity present,"The core concept is humidity; 'present' conveys presence without specifying level, exposure, or timing. Category: Physical force. Humidity (physical force) [3525006] is the correct code for the physical phenomenon. A parent Physical force would be less specific, and siblings like Temperature are not applicable. Child concepts with relative/absolute qualifiers or measurement are not indicated. The entry remains uniquely codable to humidity."
737439009,Seizure disorder clinical management plan (record artifact),Seizure disorder care plan documented in chart,"This statement indicates a care plan for seizure disorder that is documented, which fits the notion of a clinical management plan as a record artifact. No clinical attributes beyond existence/documentation are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 737439009 maps precisely because it is a seizure disorder clinical management plan artifact. A parent concept like generic care plan would be too broad, and any sibling representing treatment plans or epilepsy-specific plans would be misaligned. ""Care plan"" is a clinically accepted synonym for clinical management plan without changing the intended code."
89521000,Sensory and motor testing (procedure),Sensation and movement evaluation,"This entry describes an evaluative procedure of sensation (sensory) and movement (motor) without introducing attributes such as site, timing, severity, or cause. It is a Procedure and maps to Sensory and motor testing (procedure) SCTID 89521000. It is more specific than a general neurologic exam and more comprehensive than an isolated sensory or motor evaluation. Using lay-to-clinical synonym pairs ('sensation' for sensory and 'movement' for motor) is semantically equivalent and does not change the target code."
277227004,Granulomatous nasal mucosa (finding),Exam finding: granulomatous nasal mucosa,"The phrase records an examination finding of granulomatous changes in the nasal mucosa, explicitly matching the site and pattern. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps to Granulomatous nasal mucosa (finding), SCTID 277227004, and adds no etiologic or subtype information. More general parent concepts lack specificity, and sibling concepts involving different sites or discrete granulomas would not align with the mucosal finding described."
386873009,Lisinopril (substance),Diagnostic report mentions the ingredient lisinopril,"The report reference names lisinopril as an ingredient only, without asserting detection, dose, route, strength, administration status, or formulation. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise match is Lisinopril (substance) [386873009]. Concepts like ACE inhibitor (substance) would be too general, whereas medicinal product siblings would introduce attributes not included here. Mentioning it as an ingredient maintains equivalence to the substance concept."
223848009,Mallorca (geographic location),Majorca,"“Majorca” is the standard English synonym for “Mallorca,” referring to the same place. The main concept is a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). This wording exactly corresponds to SCTID 223848009 because it identifies the same location entity. Parent concepts like general geographic location are too broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., Menorca) or child concepts (e.g., Palma de Mallorca) are not suggested. Using the synonym does not add attributes or change meaning; it is clinically equivalent to “Mallorca.”"
402114009,Suspensory system supports (physical object),Suspensory system support articles,"This phrase denotes articles that serve as supports within a suspensory system, consistent with 'Suspensory system supports (physical object)' SCTID 402114009. Category: Physical object. 'Articles' is a neutral synonym for physical items and does not introduce specificity like material or form factor. It is more precise than a generic support category and less specific than named child devices, making the given concept the best fit."
301470001,Tympanic membrane inflamed (finding),"Patient states: ""the doctor said my eardrum is inflamed""","Even in patient-reported words, the concept conveyed is an inflamed eardrum (tympanic membrane), which is a Clinical finding. This statement does not add attributes like severity, cause, or laterality. SNOMED CT 301470001 is the most precise code. Using a disorder concept (myringitis) would change the category to a disease, and broader findings would be less specific than the exact site-and-state combination of this entry."
227028002,Low fat turkey sausage (substance),Chart entry: low-fat turkey sausage,"The phrase indicates a charted item without altering the substance identity, which is low-fat turkey sausage. No new attributes (e.g., quantity, timing, preparation style) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 227028002 Low fat turkey sausage (substance) is the exact match. Parents are too general and do not include the low-fat property, while siblings that change meat type or fat level would not match the wording."
4481000175102,Diabetes mellitus screening not done (situation),Diabetes mellitus preventive screening not performed.,"The entry indicates that preventive screening for diabetes mellitus was not performed. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It aligns with SCTID 4481000175102 because it captures the non-performance of diabetes screening specifically. Broader parents do not specify diabetes, and siblings adding reasons or test modalities (e.g., A1c not done) are not stated. “Preventive screening” reflects the nature of screening but does not alter the concept; “not performed” is synonymous with “not done.”"
251803000,Child developmental finding (finding),Report: child developmental finding,"This entry reflects that a report contains a child developmental finding, without specifying nature or outcome. It is a Clinical finding. SCTID 251803000 is the precise code, representing a child developmental finding. The broader developmental finding code would lose the child focus, and detailed children (e.g., normal child development, developmental delay) would add attributes not stated. The report context is provenance and does not change the concept."
362131005,Entire gastric mucous membrane (body structure),Entire gastric mucosa,"By stating “entire,” the entry clearly refers to the whole mucosa of the stomach, i.e., the gastric mucous membrane. This is a Body structure and matches SNOMED CT 362131005 Entire gastric mucous membrane precisely. No further attributes or subsites are present, so parent concepts are too general and child subsites are too specific. It excludes sibling structures like gastric wall or serosa. The phrasing directly mirrors the FSN scope."
174156691000119104,Hepatitis C treatment declined (situation),HCV medications declined.,"This entry indicates refusal of medications used to treat HCV, which is synonymous with declining hepatitis C treatment. It does not introduce specificity about drug names, duration, or reasons. The concept class is Situation because it captures patient refusal. The most precise SNOMED match is “Hepatitis C treatment declined (situation)”; parent concepts like “medication refused” are too broad and not linked to HCV, and sibling concepts like “HCV therapy not indicated” are clinically different. Referencing medications as the core of HCV treatment is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
217621008,"Accident due to sudden air pressure change, aircraft diving (event)",Accident related to sudden air-pressure variation in a diving aircraft,"The entry presents an aviation accident linked to a sudden air-pressure variation when the aircraft was diving. This is an Event. It fits 217621008 because it combines 'accident,' 'sudden air pressure change,' and 'aircraft diving.' Parent concepts without the dive qualifier or sibling events like 'aircraft accident without cause specified' would not be as precise. 'Air-pressure variation' is an equivalent way to express 'air pressure change' without adding attributes."
217260003,Accident due to collapse of burning boarding house (event),Accident due to collapse of burning boarding house,"This wording explicitly describes an accident caused by the collapse of a boarding house that was burning, which directly corresponds to the SNOMED CT Event concept SCTID 217260003. It contains the essential elements—accident, collapse, burning, and boarding house—without adding any extra attributes such as severity, timing, or injury details. More general parent concepts like accidents due to collapse of burning buildings lack the specific boarding house context, and siblings involving other building types or non-collapse fire events would not be as precise."
465513009,Vascular Doppler system probe (physical object),Probe for vascular Doppler system,"This formulation clearly identifies a probe intended for a vascular Doppler system. The category is Physical object (device). It maps to SCTID 465513009 by specifying the component, not the overall system or other Doppler domains. Parent concepts (generic probes) and sibling concepts (other modality probes) are less precise, while child variants (e.g., frequency-specific probes) would add details not present here. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to 'vascular Doppler system probe.'"
704907004,Screw-extraction orthopedic reamer (physical object),Screw-extraction reamer used in orthopedics,"This describes the device’s purpose and clinical domain while still naming it as a reamer for screw extraction. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). It differentiates from general or non-orthopedic reamers and from other screw removal instruments (drivers, extractors) that are not reamers. No new properties like size or manufacturer are added, so the correct mapping remains Screw-extraction orthopedic reamer (physical object)."
734334006,Specimen from sebaceous cyst (specimen),Cyst specimen (sebaceous),"This entry describes a cyst specimen and clarifies the cyst type as sebaceous, which equates to a specimen taken from a sebaceous cyst. The concept is within the Specimen hierarchy and maps to SNOMED CT 734334006. A generic parent like “Specimen from cyst” is too broad. Child concepts that specify tissue or fluid are not indicated. Siblings for non-sebaceous cyst sources are not appropriate since the cyst type is specified as sebaceous."
1352911003,Union for International Cancer Control stage IB (qualifier value),Recorded UICC stage IB,"This entry documents that the UICC stage IB has been recorded, but the core concept remains the UICC stage subgroup IB. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It is most precisely “Union for International Cancer Control stage IB (qualifier value)” because it specifies the UICC stage IB without additional attributes like site or clinical/pathological qualifiers. Parent or sibling concepts would misrepresent the explicit IB subgroup."
714473001,Entire anterior vertebral muscle of neck (body structure),Entire anterior vertebral muscle (neck),"This concise entry identifies the anterior vertebral muscle and constrains the location to the neck, with “entire” indicating the whole structure. The concept is a Body structure and maps to SCTID 714473001. Broader parent terms (e.g., neck muscle) are not as precise. Child concepts specifying individual prevertebral muscles are too narrow and are not named. Siblings (e.g., posterior vertebral neck muscles) are excluded by “anterior vertebral.” The use of parentheses for “neck” is stylistic and does not alter the clinical meaning. No additional attributes are introduced, preserving an accurate mapping to the intended entire anatomical structure."
371544005,Targeted history and physical report (record artifact),Problem-focused history and physical report,"This specifies a report restricted to a problem-focused H&P, which is clinically equivalent to a targeted H&P document. Category: Record artifact. SCTID 371544005 fits because “problem-focused” is an accepted synonym for targeted scope. A parent “History and physical report” would be too general, and siblings such as comprehensive or specialty-specific reports would add context not stated. The entry reflects the same artifact without extra attributes."
309153000,Excised parathyroid specimen (specimen),Surgically removed parathyroid tissue specimen,"By stating that the parathyroid tissue specimen was surgically removed, the entry conveys excision, which is clinically equivalent to “excised,” matching SCTID 309153000. Category: Specimen. This is more specific than parent parathyroid specimen concepts and does not align with siblings that denote different procurement methods like biopsy or aspiration. No added attributes like laterality or processing are present."
392574006,Product containing posterior pituitary hormone (product),Neurohypophyseal hormone medicinal preparation,"The phrase identifies a medicinal preparation with a neurohypophyseal (posterior pituitary) hormone as the active ingredient. There are no additional attributes like dose, route, or brand. The correct mapping is SNOMED CT Product: “Product containing posterior pituitary hormone (product)” (392574006). It avoids child concepts by not naming a specific hormone, and it is narrower than parent classes such as general hormone preparations. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not change the selection."
242374007,Accidental exposure to metallic lead (event),Accidental exposure to lead in metallic form,"Specifying 'lead in metallic form' unambiguously identifies metallic/elemental lead, and 'accidental exposure' conveys the event. The main concept is exposure; there are no added attributes like route or outcome. SNOMED CT category: Event. This aligns with 242374007 as it precisely captures accidental exposure to metallic lead. Parent concepts without the form specification are less exact, and sibling concepts for lead compounds or poisoning do not apply."
414480009,Increased vascular pattern of colon (finding),Prominent colonic vascular pattern,"This phrasing describes a prominence of the vascular pattern in the colon, which is clinically equivalent to increased vascular pattern. The concept category is Clinical finding. It maps best to SCTID 414480009 because it specifies the colon and an increased vascular pattern. It is more precise than a general abnormal vascular pattern of colon and does not imply other conditions like angiodysplasia or hyperemia, nor does it indicate decreased or absent vascular pattern, so siblings and parents are less appropriate."
251760009,Optical fusion (observable entity),Retinal image optical fusion,"Retinal image optical fusion describes the sensory fusion of images formed on the retinas, aligned with optical fusion as the observable construct. This maps to Optical fusion (observable entity) [251760009]. It does not add laterality or a value, and it remains an Observable entity. Motor fusion/vergence is a different observable, and stereopsis is a different sensory function; thus, those sibling concepts are less appropriate. The wording is a clinically acceptable paraphrase that does not alter code selection."
328683006,Gluten-free brown bread mix (product),Gluten-free brown bread loaf mix,"This describes a mix for baking a brown bread loaf that is gluten-free; ‘loaf mix’ indicates the same bread-mix form for brown bread. The concept remains a gluten-free brown bread mix. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 328683006 is exact. A parent like “gluten-free bread mix” lacks the brown bread specificity, and a sibling “brown bread loaf mix” without gluten-free would not match. The term ‘loaf mix’ is a safe paraphrase for bread mix and does not change the product type."
411684005,Egg yolk diagnostic allergen extract (product),Egg yolk allergen diagnostic product,"The phrase identifies a product intended for diagnostic use, containing allergenic components from egg yolk. The principal concept is a diagnostic allergen extract with a specified source, which falls under SNOMED CT Product and corresponds to 'Egg yolk diagnostic allergen extract' SCTID 411684005. The wording excludes therapeutic application and avoids procedural attributes. Broader parents without yolk detail or sibling products derived from other egg components would not match the specificity here. 'Diagnostic product' is an acceptable synonym for a diagnostic allergen extract."
16214971000119103,Specimen obtained from breast by stereotactically guided needle biopsy (specimen),Laboratory specimen: breast tissue from stereotactic needle biopsy,"In a lab context, this denotes a specimen consisting of breast tissue, specifying the acquisition via stereotactic needle biopsy. It fits the Specimen category and aligns exactly with SCTID 16214971000119103. A general ‘breast tissue specimen’ without stereotactic guidance would be less specific, and any procedure concept would misrepresent the intent since the entry labels a specimen. The synonym ‘laboratory specimen’ does not alter attributes and remains clinically equivalent to the preferred concept."
41000179103,Immunization record (record artifact),Immunization record provided by patient,"This entry documents that the patient supplied the immunization record, emphasizing the artifact rather than any clinical status. The concept is a record artifact; 'provided by patient' is contextual workflow detail that does not change the document type. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Immunization record (record artifact) matches precisely, while parent generic records are less specific, and siblings like certificates or consents are not suggested. The mapping remains to the immunization record."
24025005,"Depolarization of nerve cell and nerve fiber, function (observable entity)",Depolarization property of neurons and nerve fibers,"‘Property’ serves as a synonym for an observable physiological function, referring to depolarization in neurons and nerve fibers. The entry does not introduce results, methods, or pathologic states. It is more specific than a generic membrane depolarization observable and distinct from siblings like repolarization or hyperpolarization. This phrasing remains uniquely codable to Depolarization of nerve cell and nerve fiber, function (SCTID 24025005)."
257703003,Sports center (environment),Venue: sports center,"This describes the venue as a sports center, clearly denoting the environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. The term aligns with Sports center (environment), SCTID 257703003. A generic 'sports venue' would be broader, and specific venues like 'arena' or 'gym' are not stated. 'Venue' here is a descriptor of place and does not introduce additional attributes."
736364001,Minor orthopedic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Plan of care: minor orthopedic surgery (inpatient),"“Plan of care” is a common synonym for “care plan,” and the phrase clearly specifies the minor orthopedic surgery focus in the inpatient context. No extra attributes like timing (pre/post-op), laterality, or associated conditions are introduced. Category: Record artifact. The SCTID 736364001 exactly represents an inpatient care plan for minor orthopedic surgery. Using a parent such as generic surgical care plan would be too broad, and a sibling like major orthopedic surgery inpatient care plan would be inaccurate. The synonym “plan of care” is clinically equivalent and does not change the concept."
223781001,Victoria (geographic location),Previous location listed: Victoria,"The core concept is Victoria as a geographic location, with 'previous' providing temporal context for documentation rather than altering the place identity. SNOMED category: Geographic location (Environment or geographical location). Code 223781001 |Victoria (geographic location)| is the most precise match. Parent concepts would be nonspecific, and child/sibling concepts that specify particular versions of Victoria are not supported by the wording."
768456007,Product containing copper radioisotope (product),Ordered: copper radioisotope product,"While 'ordered' reflects administrative context, the core concept is the product containing a copper radioisotope. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The entry maps to SCTID 768456007 because it identifies the product entity and copper radioisotope content without specifying particular copper isotopes, dose, route, or clinical application. A parent concept of radioisotope product would be too broad, and any child specifying copper‑64 or copper‑67 would be too specific for the text."
46499007,Bolus awareness (finding),Reports feeling the bolus when swallowing,"This expresses subjective sensation of the bolus during the act of swallowing, i.e., bolus awareness. The main concept is bolus awareness, categorized as a Clinical finding. It maps specifically to Bolus awareness (finding) [SCTID: 46499007]. The phrasing does not introduce impairment, motor aspects, or location details, which would shift the mapping toward child/sibling concepts like reduced awareness or bolus transit. The synonym “feeling the bolus” is clinically equivalent to awareness/sensation of the bolus, leaving the code unchanged."
731024008,Entire Gartner's duct (body structure),Complete Gartner's duct,"The term 'Complete' unambiguously captures the entire anatomical structure of the Gartner's duct without implying pathology, laterality, or other attributes. This falls under the Body structure category. The best code is 731024008 (Entire Gartner's duct) because the phrasing dictates the full duct. Parent concepts lacking the entire qualifier and child concepts implying segments or abnormalities are less precise. 'Complete' is a valid synonym for 'entire.'"
29561007,Repair of epididymis and spermatic cord (procedure),Patient underwent repair of epididymis and spermatic cord,"This patient-centered statement documents that the procedure performed was repair of both the epididymis and the spermatic cord, with no mention of laterality, cause, or technique. It is a Procedure and best represented by the SNOMED CT concept Repair of epididymis and spermatic cord. Parent codes lack specificity and siblings or children referencing a single structure or different actions would be inaccurate. The phrase 'underwent' indicates completion but does not introduce a distinct coding concept beyond the procedure itself."
272140006,Directions of movement (qualifier value),Movement direction noted,"This documentation-style entry indicates that the movement’s directional aspect is noted, without naming the direction or adding modifiers. As a Qualifier value, Directions of movement (qualifier value) [272140006] best fits. The broader Direction (qualifier value) would not be movement-specific, and called-out specific direction children are absent. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase and does not change code selection."
223847004,Ibiza (geographic location),Exposure place: Ibiza,"This entry cites Ibiza as the exposure place, which still represents the geographic location and maps to Ibiza (geographic location) [SCTID: 223847004]. The primary concept is the location; the exposure context does not modify the geographic entity. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). It neither generalizes to parent areas nor narrows to child sites, ensuring the given code is the most appropriate fit."
124957007,"Second-set graft rejection, function (observable entity)",Follow-up parameter recorded: second-set graft rejection function,"The entry treats the second-set graft rejection function as a follow-up parameter; the underlying concept remains the function itself. This is an Observable entity. SCTID 124957007 is the best match because it encodes the function for second-set rejection. A parent observable lacking the second-set qualifier is too broad, and disorder codes would misclassify the concept as a clinical condition. The wording avoids adding attributes like normality or graft type, keeping it uniquely codable to the specified observable."
467104000,Wound measure (physical object),Wound measure stocked in supply cart,"This indicates the wound measure object is stocked, naming the physical object used to measure wounds. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 467104000 matches because the entry is wound-focused and generic; it avoids mapping to a broader measuring device parent concept or to a subtype child concept. The stocking context does not introduce attributes that change the object coding."
73653000,Structure of hair matrix (body structure),Reference anatomy: hair matrix,"The phrase uses hair matrix as a reference anatomical site, which does not alter its structural identity. As a Body structure, it maps to Structure of hair matrix (SCTID 73653000). It stays specific and avoids inclusion of broader follicular structures or pathology, keeping parent and sibling concepts inappropriate for this wording."
1380079009,Union for International Cancer Control aT1c1 (qualifier value),UICC aT1c1 qualifier value,"This explicitly names the qualifier value UICC aT1c1, confirming its role as a staging descriptor rather than a clinical finding or disorder. It aligns exactly with SNOMED CT qualifier value 1380079009. Parent concepts are less specific, and siblings alter the prefix or subdivision. The wording is a direct synonym and keeps code accuracy."
285083000,Circus (environment),Circus locale,"The wording indicates the locale as a circus, without adding timing, cause, or clinical events. Category: Environment. SCTID 285083000 is the precise match as the entry names the circus environment explicitly. Parents like generic locales are too broad, and children such as precise circus structures are not specified. “Locale” is a synonymous place descriptor and does not alter the concept selection."
1184586001,Medical device document section (record artifact),Medical device document section,"The entry explicitly names a clinical document section dedicated to medical devices. The main concept is a section within a health record, not the device itself. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the most precise match is Medical device document section (1184586001). A generic parent like Document section would be less specific, and siblings such as Allergy section or Adverse device event section are not indicated. This phrasing is the exact FSN-equivalent for the section and adds no attributes (e.g., device type, timing, severity), so it maps uniquely to 1184586001."
280222002,Structure of branch of nasociliary nerve (body structure),Structure of nasociliary nerve branch,"The wording explicitly emphasizes the structural aspect of a branch of the nasociliary nerve. This belongs to the Body structure category. SCTID 280222002 matches exactly. More general parent structures or specific child branches are not indicated, so this generic branch-structure concept is most precise."
48814003,Fannia manicata (organism),Species confirmed: Fannia manicata,"This text conveys confirmation of the species Fannia manicata and nothing else. The main concept is the organism at the species level. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to Organism and best maps to SCTID 48814003. The term “confirmed” reflects identification status but does not introduce a different class of concept (e.g., a finding or event); it remains the species label. Parent or sibling taxa would be less precise than the named species."
1526002,Free-standing breast clinic (environment),Procedure performed at an independent breast clinic.,"This documentation notes the facility context of a procedure, specifying an independent (freestanding) breast clinic, focusing on the environment rather than the procedure itself. In SNOMED CT, this is an environment concept, and Free-standing breast clinic (environment) [1526002] is the precise match. Using “independent” is a clinically equivalent synonym for freestanding. A generic breast clinic code omits the independence attribute, and hospital-based variants would be incorrect."
223970006,Dyfed (geographic location),Travel history: Dyfed,"Here Dyfed is specified as a travel location, which still centers on the place name without other geographic qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The exact concept is SCTID 223970006 Dyfed (geographic location). No parent (e.g., Wales) or child locations (towns within Dyfed) are indicated. The travel context does not alter the code—only the relationship to the location."
284440009,Market (environment),Market area,"The term ""area"" indicates the physical area of a market, maintaining an environmental focus without additional attributes. In SNOMED CT, this falls under Environment or geographical location and maps to Market (environment). It does not broaden to generic commercial areas or narrow to specific market types (e.g., flea market). As a place-based synonym, it remains clinically equivalent and does not change the target concept or code selection."
736018001,Elective upper segment cesarean section with bilateral tubal ligation (procedure),Scheduled classical cesarean section with bilateral tubal ligation,"This documentation conveys a planned (scheduled) procedure, which is clinically equivalent to ‘elective,’ and specifies a classical cesarean section (i.e., upper segment) with bilateral tubal ligation. The main concepts are classical/upper segment cesarean and bilateral tubal ligation, with the elective nature implied by ‘scheduled.’ Category: Procedure. A parent code for classical cesarean alone would be incomplete because the tubal ligation is included, and siblings like lower segment cesarean or salpingectomy-based sterilization do not match the wording. ‘Classical’ is a clinically accepted synonym for ‘upper segment,’ so it retains the same concept scope."
242302005,Accidental ingestion of argemone oil (event),Unplanned ingestion of argemone oil,"The concept is an unplanned (accidental) ingestion of argemone oil. Category: Event. ""Unplanned"" serves as a synonym for accidental in this context, keeping the semantics identical to SCTID 242302005. It adds no attributes like timing or severity and excludes other exposure routes and outcomes, making parent or sibling concepts less accurate."
257594004,Dance hall (environment),Location: dance hall,"This entry records the location and names it as a dance hall, which directly corresponds to Dance hall (environment) [257594004] under the Environment category. The documentation cue “Location:” does not add any extra attributes; it simply situates the concept in a typical note field. Parent concepts like general locations would be overly broad, and alternate venue types (nightclub, ballroom) are not suggested. Therefore, the specific environment code 257594004 is appropriate."
392573000,Product containing anterior pituitary hormone (product),Anterior pituitary hormone formulation,"“Formulation” in this context indicates a medicinal product form containing an anterior pituitary hormone, without specifying dose form or strength. It falls under SNOMED CT Pharmaceutical/biologic product and corresponds to SCTID 392573000. Choosing a generic hormone product would omit the anterior pituitary specificity, while picking a specific hormone child concept (e.g., somatotropin, ACTH) would over-specify. The anterior qualifier ensures it’s not a posterior pituitary hormone product."
1304081004,Light transmission aggregometry technique (qualifier value),"Patient statement: ""They used the light transmission aggregometry technique.""","Even in a patient-quoted context, the entry clearly identifies the technique used as light transmission aggregometry, keeping the focus on the methodological qualifier without adding procedural or result details. The main concept is the technique, which fits the Qualifier value category. The precise SNOMED CT match is Light transmission aggregometry technique (SCTID 1304081004). A general parent (Technique) lacks specificity, and sibling options like impedance aggregometry would mischaracterize the method. The quote uses a clinically equivalent expression and does not change the coding intent."
704531001,South African sign language (qualifier value),South African Sign Language for encounters,"The entry references South African Sign Language as the language value used in encounters; the main concept remains the specific language. As a Qualifier value, SCTID 704531001 is the most precise code. The contextual phrase does not change the underlying concept. Parent concepts (e.g., Sign language) are broader, and other specific sign language siblings are not applicable."
80074009,Responsive (qualifier value),Flowsheet entry: responsive,"The phrase indicates that a flowsheet entry uses the value 'responsive' without describing stimulus, timing, or severity, and thus functions as a pure qualifier. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category and maps to SCTID 80074009. Parents are overly broad, and siblings like 'unresponsive' or specificity such as 'responsive to verbal cues' are not implied. The context (flowsheet) does not change the semantic content of the value. Therefore, 'Responsive (qualifier value)' is the precise match."
430379005,Cytologic material obtained from pericardial fluid (specimen),Pericardial fluid-derived cytologic material,"‘Derived from’ emphasizes the source relationship without adding procedural detail, describing cytologic material from pericardial fluid. This is a Specimen concept and aligns with SCTID 430379005. It avoids naming specific preparation methods or clinical indications. Parent concepts would be too general, and siblings referring to other body fluids would be incorrect. No extraneous attributes are introduced."
225747005,X-ray department (environment),Radiography dept,"Abbreviating 'department' preserves the meaning: the departmental environment dedicated to radiography (X-ray). SNOMED CT category: Environment (environment). This maps best to SCTID 225747005 rather than radiology as a parent category, and it is not a child such as a single 'X-ray room'. The abbreviation is a stylistic variant without added attributes."
2957008,Gallbladder contraction reflex (observable entity),Cholecystic contraction reflex,"This is a clinically equivalent synonym: 'cholecystic' pertains to the gallbladder, and 'contraction reflex' denotes the same physiologic phenomenon. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, aligned with SCTID 2957008. It does not imply normal/abnormal status or any testing procedure, so alternative codes for findings or procedures would be less appropriate than the exact observable entity."
284267001,Does not use palmar grip (finding),Grip pattern: palmar (palm) grip not used,This documents the specific grip pattern and notes nonuse of the palmar (palm) grip. 'Palm grip' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'palmar grip'. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The entry maps to SCTID 284267001 by focusing solely on usage nonuse of a specific grip type. Sibling concepts such as 'power grip impaired' or 'absent palmar grasp reflex' are not indicated and would be less accurate.
787863009,Product containing sclerostin inhibitor (product),Therapeutic product: sclerostin inhibitor,"The wording indicates a therapeutic product characterized by a sclerostin inhibitor class, which falls under the SNOMED CT Pharmaceutical/biologic product domain. The correct concept is Product containing sclerostin inhibitor (product), SCTID 787863009. It does not introduce form, strength, dose, or brand, so clinical drug children are not selected. It is not a procedure (e.g., therapy administration), because the focus is on the product itself. “Therapeutic product” is an acceptable synonym for medicinal product without changing the intended code."
270840000,Disabled drivers orange badge (record artifact),Orange badge—disabled driver,"This phrasing points to the same artifact, the orange badge designated for disabled drivers, functioning as a concise synonym. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 270840000 is the best fit because it names the specific badge variant. Using more general or alternative badge concepts would be less accurate. The synonym does not add attributes or imply different status; it remains equivalent to the preferred term."
417153003,Referral for home nurse visit (procedure),Referral to home-visit nursing service for a home visit,"This entry specifies a referral to a nursing service that conducts home visits, clearly indicating the administrative procedure to arrange a nurse home visit. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It aligns with 417153003 because it denotes a referral for a nurse visit at home. A parent like ‘referral to nursing service’ is insufficiently specific to the home visit component, and a concept for the visit itself would not capture the referral action. The synonym ‘home-visit nursing service’ retains equivalence without adding attributes."
122614000,Specimen from lung obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure (specimen),Lung fine needle aspirate sample (specimen),"The entry labels a specimen/sample as a fine needle aspirate from the lung. Category: Specimen. SCTID 122614000 is the most precise mapping because it includes both the lung site and the fine needle aspiration technique. Parent concepts omitting method or generic sample terms without site are under-specified, while siblings with other acquisition methods are incorrect. “Sample” is commonly used interchangeably with “specimen” in clinical documentation and remains equivalent here."
446768006,Joint protection knowledge assessment score (observable entity),Score for joint protection knowledge assessment,"This entry specifies the score obtained from a joint protection knowledge assessment, making the observable entity the focal point. The concept category is Observable entity, consistent with “Joint protection knowledge assessment score” (SCTID 446768006). It avoids adding attributes (e.g., value, timing, interpretation) and does not describe the assessment procedure itself. A generic assessment score would be too broad (parent), and a sibling like an assessment of joint protection behaviors or techniques would differ in subject matter. The wording precisely anchors the score to the joint protection knowledge domain."
720841006,Endomicroscopy probe (physical object),Endomicroscopy probe — device,"The entry denotes a device that is an endomicroscopy probe, adding no further attributes such as type, manufacturer, or disposable status. The category is Physical object. It matches Endomicroscopy probe (physical object) SCTID 720841006 most precisely. Broad parent concepts like endoscopy device would be nonspecific, and a sibling such as an endomicroscope (system) or a child like confocal variants are not supported by the wording. The dashed addition 'device' is contextual and does not alter the concept selection."
1156871006,Wellness record (record artifact),Wellness health record,"The inclusion of 'health' here is descriptive of the wellness domain and does not broaden the concept beyond a wellness-focused record. No clinical attributes are added. It remains in the Record artifact category and corresponds to SCTID 1156871006. It should not be coded as a general health record (parent) or a 'report' or 'plan' (sibling), because 'record' and 'wellness' are both specified."
257569000,Baseball field (environment),The baseball field,"The concept is the baseball field environment referenced definitively. Category: Environment or geographical location. The definite article 'the' does not introduce new attributes; the best match remains Baseball field (environment), SCTID 257569000. Broader or alternative environment concepts (sports field, baseball stadium) are excluded by the explicit focus on the baseball field itself."
415642007,Structure of zygomatic bone and/or bone of zygomatic arch (body structure),Zygoma bone and/or bone of zygomatic arch,"This concise anatomical designation lists either the zygoma bone (zygomatic bone) or the bone of the zygomatic arch, without adding qualifiers or conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It matches SCTID 415642007, which is defined as structure of zygomatic bone and/or bone of zygomatic arch. A child concept like “bone of zygomatic arch” or “zygomatic bone” alone would not reflect the and/or construction. Parent concepts for facial bones or arches are too broad or include non-bony components, so this code is the most precise."
298045000,Entire metencephalon of fetus (body structure),Fetal metencephalon—entire structure,"This statement clearly indicates 'fetal metencephalon' and qualifies it as the 'entire structure'. The concept is the complete metencephalon in a fetus, i.e., a body structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The 'entire structure' qualifier aligns exactly with SCTID 298045000. A parent concept like 'structure of fetal metencephalon' would not guarantee totality, and child concepts like 'fetal cerebellum' or 'fetal pons' would be incomplete. Siblings representing other brain divisions (e.g., diencephalon) are not relevant."
871736002,Structure of space and/or soft connective tissue within mediastinal cavity (body structure),Target anatomy: mediastinal soft connective tissues,"In procedural or planning context, this entry names the target anatomy as the soft connective tissues within the mediastinum, with no additional attributes added. The concept is anatomical and a SNOMED CT Body structure. SCTID 871736002 is the most precise match, as it represents space and/or soft connective tissue within the mediastinal cavity. The broader mediastinum would include organs and cavities, while compartment-specific or tissue-specific child/sibling concepts would be too granular. The phrase is a clinically equivalent synonym that preserves the intended scope."
36861008,Injection into bursa of hand (procedure),Clinical note entry: hand bursa injection,"As a clinical note entry, 'hand bursa injection' indicates a procedure into a bursa of the hand. The phrasing avoids extra attributes such as agent, guidance, laterality, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure and the most specific match is SCTID 36861008. A broader parent omits the site, and sibling/child concepts for joints, tendon sheaths, or specific digits are not indicated because the target is a bursa and no finer site is given. The contextual label simply indicates a documentation section."
442991000124104,Adult high protein formula (product),Start adult high protein formula today,"This indicates initiation of a product: adult high protein formula. The only attributes are adult targeting and high protein content; it avoids specifying route, dose, or form. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate mapping is to the Product concept with SCTID 442991000124104. A parent concept missing either attribute would be less specific, and any child adding administration route or special composition would extend beyond the statement. The verb “Start” is contextual and does not change the product coded."
223608003,Iraq (geographic location),Iraq,"The entry is the stand-alone country name, which directly denotes the specific geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (geographic location). SCTID 223608003 corresponds precisely to Iraq (geographic location). More general parents like Country (geographic location) or region-level concepts are too broad, and child or sibling locations (e.g., cities within Iraq or other countries) are not indicated. No attributes such as travel, residence, or birth are expressed, so situation or social context concepts are less appropriate."
224013005,Alberta (geographic location),Service area: Alberta,"This entry identifies the service area as Alberta, which still denotes the province and corresponds to Alberta (geographic location) [224013005]. Main concept: provincial geographic location; category: Qualifier value (Geographic location). The operational context 'service area' does not alter the geographic entity. No reference to parent country or child subdivisions is made, keeping the mapping specific to Alberta."
1193631002,Bouvet Island (geographic location),Bouvet Island identified as location,"This entry confirms the identified location is Bouvet Island, with no modifiers or additional clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The precise code is 1193631002. Parents like Island or Geographic location lack specificity, and siblings would misidentify a different site. The identification context does not alter the underlying geographic concept."
1290521000000109,Occupational exposure to monkeypox virus (event),Exposure to monkeypox virus in the workplace,"This narrative frames the exposure event explicitly in the workplace, specifying the agent as monkeypox virus. It falls within SNOMED CT’s Event hierarchy and matches SCTID 1290521000000109. Parent terms without occupational context are less specific, and children with mechanism (e.g., laboratory accident) are not stated. No additional attributes (e.g., severity, timing, certainty) are introduced, confirming this is the most accurate code choice for an occupational exposure to the monkeypox virus."
249010001,Anteroposterior diameter of pelvic outlet (observable entity),AP diameter—pelvic outlet,"This succinct label names the AP diameter and the pelvic outlet, clearly identifying the exact measurement without values or judgments. It is an Observable entity. SCTID 249010001 is the most precise match because both orientation and location are specified. Parent concepts lacking orientation or siblings with transverse orientation or inlet level are inappropriate."
6401000179105,Interdisciplinary medical staff meeting record (record artifact),Interdisciplinary medical staff meeting record available,"The entry expresses the presence of the interdisciplinary medical staff meeting record, which is a record artifact. Availability is contextual and does not change the underlying concept, making SCTID 6401000179105 the correct code. Parent concepts like general availability of records are too broad, and siblings referring to different meeting types or team structures would not align with the explicit 'interdisciplinary medical staff' wording."
444386009,Exposure to Enterobius vermicularis (event),Pinworm exposure,"The entry denotes exposure to pinworm, which is the common name for Enterobius vermicularis; this is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not add attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event since it describes an exposure occurrence. This maps most specifically to 444386009, avoiding broader exposure concepts and correctly not mapping to any disorder (e.g., pinworm infection) because no disease or symptoms are stated. The synonym does not change code selection as it identifies the same organism."
449197002,Genus Glyptemys (organism),Organism classification—Glyptemys (genus),"The entry describes Glyptemys as an organism classification at the genus rank. The main concept is the genus Glyptemys. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 449197002 fits exactly, as no species are mentioned (excluding child concepts) and no higher taxa are referenced (excluding parents). The inclusion of “organism classification” provides context but does not introduce additional attributes; it remains a genus-level synonym."
229687004,Cerebellar dysarthria (finding),Patient states they were told they have cerebellar dysarthria,"The patient-reported statement still identifies the clinical finding of cerebellar dysarthria, corresponding to Cerebellar dysarthria (finding) SCTID: 229687004. This is categorized as a Clinical finding. Even in patient wording, the precise subtype is named, making it more specific than parent dysarthria and not indicative of other subtypes. No additional attributes (severity, timing, cause) are added."
427695007,Newborn nursery unit (environment),Assigned bed in the newborn nursery unit,"This statement identifies the environment where a bed is assigned: the newborn nursery unit. The main concept is the location. In SNOMED CT, it maps to the Environment concept 427695007. The wording does not imply intensive or special care settings and is more specific than broader neonatal unit terms. Mention of a bed assignment is contextual and does not change the environment being referenced."
730551005,Entire fifth right posterior intercostal vein (body structure),Dissection label: right fifth posterior intercostal vein (entire),"This label identifies the complete right posterior intercostal vein at the fifth interspace during dissection. Category: Body structure. It aligns with SCTID 730551005 by explicitly specifying right laterality and the fifth level; inclusion of “entire” matches the whole-structure modeling. Parent concepts that omit level or laterality would be underspecified, and child concepts describing branches or segments would be over-specific. No clinical condition is implied."
118847001,Procedure on mesentery (procedure),Procedure involving mesenteric tissue,"This phrase indicates a procedure that involves mesenteric tissue (the mesentery) without specifying the nature or technique of the intervention. The main concept is a procedure on the mesentery; SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 118847001 is appropriate as it represents unspecified procedures on the mesentery. Parent-level concepts like procedures on abdominal structures are overly broad, and child-level concepts such as mesenteric biopsy or excision are too specific and not supported by the wording. Using 'mesenteric tissue' is a clinically equivalent way to refer to the mesentery and does not alter the intended code."
261082009,Structure of floor of coronary sinus (body structure),Coronary sinus floor,"This is a concise noun phrase that denotes the same anatomical entity as 'floor of coronary sinus,' without implying any condition or context beyond the structure. It fits the Body structure concept 'Structure of floor of coronary sinus' (SCTID: 261082009). Using a broader parent such as 'Coronary sinus' or 'Wall of coronary sinus' would lose specificity. It does not suggest a sibling part (e.g., roof), and the reversed noun order is a common, clinically equivalent synonym."
386595001,Product containing triazolopyridine (product),Radiology intake: triazolopyridine pharmaceutical product noted,"Within an imaging intake context, the entry identifies a pharmaceutical product characterized by triazolopyridine, without specifying dose, route, form, or brand. The main concept is a product containing triazolopyridine. This fits the SNOMED CT Product category, and SCTID 386595001 is the most accurate code. More general parents would miss the ingredient specificity, and children specifying a particular preparation would exceed the information given. “Pharmaceutical product” is a clinically equivalent synonym for medicinal product, maintaining the same code selection."
247511003,Large lunula (finding),Large nail lunula,"Specifying 'nail lunula' clarifies the anatomical structure while 'large' conveys the size abnormality, equivalent to 'large lunula'. The main concept remains a Clinical finding involving increased lunula size. The best SNOMED CT code is 247511003. More general parent categories lack the size detail, and siblings covering different lunula states are inappropriate. No extra attributes (e.g., finger, laterality, etiology) are introduced, maintaining the precise match."
103197007,Human leukocyte antigen DR52 (substance),Transplant immunology term: HLA-DR52 antigen,"In a transplant context, HLA-DR52 still denotes the antigen substance; no procedural or result attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with the appropriate mapping to Human leukocyte antigen DR52 (substance) SCTID 103197007. The wording does not imply the patient's phenotype or assay results, avoiding finding/observable entities. Parent concepts (general HLA) are too broad, and siblings (DR51/DR53) are distinct antigens. The synonym is clinically equivalent and maintains specificity."
243242006,Pediococcus pentosaceus (organism),Binomial: Pediococcus pentosaceus,"“Binomial” indicates the formal two-part scientific name, here Pediococcus pentosaceus, with no added clinical details. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact match is Pediococcus pentosaceus (organism), SCTID 243242006. Parent concepts (genus or broader bacteria) are less precise, and sibling species names do not match. No detection or infection is implied, so this should be coded to the organism, not to a finding or disorder."
922733961000119106,History of primary malignant melanoma of oral mucous membrane (situation),Prior primary malignant melanoma involving the oral mucous membrane — history.,"The entry states a history (prior) of a primary malignant melanoma with involvement of the oral mucous membrane. Main concepts: malignant melanoma, primary origin, site (oral mucous membrane), and the history context. This is a Situation with explicit context in SNOMED CT. The exact concept 'History of primary malignant melanoma of oral mucous membrane' is appropriate, as it encodes the past nature and specifics. A disorder concept would not reflect history, while broader history concepts without 'primary' or exact site would be less precise. The phrasing does not introduce extra attributes."
445683001,Light emitting diode lamp microscope illuminator (physical object),LED microscope illuminator,"The entry denotes a light-emitting diode (LED) illuminator specifically for a microscope, which matches the SNOMED CT concept Light emitting diode lamp microscope illuminator (physical object) with SCTID 445683001. The main concept is a physical object that provides illumination to a microscope via an LED lamp. The category is Physical object. Choosing this code is precise because it includes both the function (microscope illuminator) and the technology (LED lamp). A parent like Microscope illuminator lacks the LED specification, and siblings such as halogen or mercury vapor microscope illuminators are incorrect since LED is explicitly intended. The phrase is a direct synonym for the FSN without adding attributes."
411452006,Plastic resin system (product),Supply entry: plastic resin system.,"Although it uses the word ‘supply,’ the core concept is the product ‘plastic resin system.’ In SNOMED CT, the best match remains Plastic resin system (product), SCTID 411452006 within the Product category. The entry does not imply adhesive use, composite formulation, or a kit, avoiding over-specific or alternate sibling concepts. It also is not describing a substance-only material."
223525005,Gabon (geographic location),Gabon (sovereign state),"Describing Gabon as a sovereign state is a synonymous expression for the country and refers to the same geographic location without adding new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). The most precise code remains SCTID 223525005 for Gabon (geographic location). Generic parents would be less specific, and neither subnational children nor other country siblings are implied here."
65723001,Decreased barometric pressure (physical force),Provider notes: Low barometric pressure,"The term 'low' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'decreased' in this context and refers to ambient barometric pressure. The main concept is a reduced atmospheric pressure as a physical force. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. This aligns with 65723001 because it denotes the state of barometric pressure being below typical levels without implying a rapid change or cause. Parent concepts lacking the 'decreased' qualifier are less specific, and sibling concepts like 'increased barometric pressure' are excluded by the wording. The provider note framing does not add attributes, preserving precise mapping."
242821005,Exposure to ionizing radiation from fall-out from nuclear explosion (event),Exposure to ionizing radiation secondary to atomic blast fallout.,"This entry denotes exposure to ionizing radiation and specifies the source as fallout secondary to an atomic blast, without introducing other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242821005 is the most precise code since it represents exposure to ionizing radiation from nuclear explosion fallout. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings involving reactor accidents or medical radiation are mismatched. “Atomic blast” equates to nuclear explosion, and “secondary to fallout” clarifies source without changing the concept."
16848621000119103,History of primary malignant neoplasm of left main bronchus (situation),Chart abstract: prior primary malignant tumor of the left main bronchus.,"“Prior” signals history, and “primary malignant tumor” is a synonymous expression for primary malignant neoplasm. The site is explicitly the left main bronchus. The category is Situation. This is not a generic bronchial history or a current neoplasm; it avoids siblings such as right main bronchus or secondary malignancy. The wording maintains equivalence without introducing additional qualifiers that would lead to a different code."
12018003,Trichophyton extract skin test (substance),Clinic supply: Trichophyton extract skin test antigen,"A clinic supply reference still denotes the antigenic substance used in skin testing, centered on the material itself. The concept is a Substance. It precisely matches SCTID 12018003 by naming the Trichophyton extract skin test antigen. Parent categories are overly general, and siblings for different organisms are inappropriate. No added attributes such as brand, batch, or test results are included."
89914006,Normal endochondral bone formation (finding),Findings: normal endochondral bone formation,"This report-style entry documents 'findings' that endochondral bone formation is normal, matching 'Normal endochondral bone formation (finding)' (SCTID 89914006). The concept is a normal clinical finding regarding the endochondral ossification process. There are no additional attributes such as site, severity, or timing. The category is Clinical finding, as it records an observed status. Broader parents lacking the normal qualifier and siblings indicating abnormality or developmental disorders are less appropriate for this exact wording. The structure is narrative but does not alter the underlying concept."
260544000,Endobronchial (qualifier value),They told me it’s endobronchial.,"This patient-reported statement conveys that the described location is endobronchial—within the bronchus—without introducing severity, timing, laterality, or causal information. As a locational adjective, it belongs to the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category; Endobronchial (260544000) is the exact code. Mapping to a bronchus body structure would misinterpret the adjectival usage, and other luminal qualifiers for different airway segments would be incorrect."
473416002,Nephrostomy tube submitted as specimen (specimen),Clinical documentation: nephrostomy tube submitted as specimen to pathology,"This clinical note states the nephrostomy tube was submitted as a specimen to pathology, directly mapping to SCTID 473416002 in the Specimen hierarchy. The main concept is the device specimen; specifying the destination (pathology) does not change the specimen type. It excludes parent generic device specimens and siblings involving other devices or fluids."
224806006,Village environment (environment),Setting is a village environment,"This entry explicitly states the setting as a village environment, which is synonymous with the preferred concept and maps to SNOMED CT 224806006 under Environment. No additional attributes are introduced. Parent Environment lacks specificity, while sibling concepts that denote other settlement types would not fit the explicit village reference."
309956009,Medical microbiology department (environment),Medical microbiology dept.,"This entry uses a common abbreviation for 'department' while maintaining the same meaning: a medical microbiology department as a healthcare location. The concept remains an environment. Category: Environment or geographical location. It fits SCTID 309956009 because it specifies a department in medical microbiology, not a different service (e.g., infectious diseases) or a lab. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts like pathology department or virology department are not indicated. The abbreviation 'dept.' does not alter the concept and is clinically equivalent."
217845005,"Accidentally struck by object falling from machine, not in operation (event)",Report: accidental strike from object falling from machinery that wasn’t operating,The report states an accidental strike from an object falling from machinery that wasn’t operating. SNOMED CT category: Event. This aligns directly with 217845005 and avoids additional attributes. Choosing a parent without machine specificity or a sibling for operating machinery would not reflect the documented mechanism.
43483009,Pallas' sandgrouse (organism),Specimen source: Pallas’s sandgrouse,"This indicates that the organism associated with a specimen is Pallas’s sandgrouse, still solely naming the species. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Organism, mapped to SCTID 43483009. Parent concepts like Sandgrouse or Bird are overly broad, and sibling species would be incorrect. The 'specimen source' context does not alter the core concept; it remains the exact species identification."
1303815006,Myeloperoxidase stain technique (qualifier value),Documented technique—myeloperoxidase stain,"This indicates the technique documented is the myeloperoxidase stain, pointing to a qualifier specifying method. It does not present a result or a procedural action, so the precise SNOMED CT selection is the Qualifier value Myeloperoxidase stain technique. Parent or sibling concepts would misrepresent or generalize the named technique. The hyphenated phrasing is a documentation style variant that remains equivalent."
411888005,Staphylococcal enterotoxin B specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract: Staphylococcal enterotoxin B,This entry presents the product as a diagnostic allergen extract and identifies the targeted allergen 'Staphylococcal enterotoxin B.' The SNOMED CT category is Product. The combination of diagnostic intent and SEB specificity makes SCTID 411888005 the most accurate code. Parent categories without SEB detail or sibling codes for immunotherapy products or different toxins would not match the stated content.
708074002,Low ionic strength saline technique (qualifier value),Reported method: low ionic strength saline technique (LISS).,"The entry documents the reported method as the low ionic strength saline technique, with the LISS acronym included for clarity. The concept remains a technique qualifier without extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and 708074002 is the exact match. Generic parent qualifiers would be too broad, and sibling techniques would misidentify the method. Including the acronym does not change the meaning or add attributes; it is a clinically equivalent synonym. Therefore, 708074002 is the correct selection."
272472003,Macro projection (qualifier value),Macro projection documented,"The phrase documents the projection as 'macro,' which identifies the projection qualifier. This is best coded as 272472003 Macro projection in the Qualifier value hierarchy. Broader projection terms are too nonspecific, and direction-specific siblings are not referenced. The entry adds no anatomy or modality details, maintaining precision."
161788002,History of postmenopausal bleeding (situation),Chart review: history of postmenopausal bleeding,This entry indicates that the chart review confirms a past history of postmenopausal bleeding. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It aligns with 'History of postmenopausal bleeding (situation)' (161788002) since it clearly describes a historical condition. It should not be coded to the active finding or to broader bleeding histories. The phrase is a direct synonym and maintains the same clinical meaning without additional attributes.
260568008,Via cardiovascular system (qualifier value),Route of delivery: cardiovascular system,"The entry documents the route of delivery as the cardiovascular system, equating to 'via cardiovascular system'. This is a Qualifier value, applying to route/approach. It does not specify sub-routes such as intravenous or intra-arterial, and includes no extra details about technique or device, so more specific child qualifiers are not warranted. Non-cardiovascular routes are excluded. Therefore, SNOMED CT 260568008 is the correct code."
223387004,La Palma (geographic location),Toponym: La Palma.,"The entry treats La Palma as a toponym (place name), highlighting that it is a geographic location. Category: Geographic location. Using the term “toponym” does not introduce new attributes or alternate referents; it simply classifies the name. As there are no indications of a sub-locality or broader region, SCTID 223387004 is the precise code."
217350005,"Fumes from combustion of polyvinylchloride and similar material in conflagration, in hotel (event)",Case context: fumes from combustion of polyvinyl chloride and similar material in hotel conflagration,"The case context statement identifies the agent (combustion fumes of polyvinyl chloride and similar material), the event (conflagration), and the location (hotel), aligning with SCTID 217350005 as an Event. It refrains from introducing clinical effects or severity. Parent concepts without the hotel setting or siblings in alternative locations would not fit. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
16535401000119102,History of macular degeneration (situation),History of macular degeneration,"The statement explicitly conveys the past medical history of macular degeneration for the patient, establishing temporal context without adding type, laterality, or severity. This aligns with a Situation with explicit context in SNOMED CT, specifically History of macular degeneration (16535401000119102). Coding to the disorder Macular degeneration would be incorrect because the wording emphasizes historical context rather than an active diagnosis. More general parents like History of disease are too broad, and children or siblings such as History of age-related macular degeneration or family history are not indicated."
306472005,Discharge by endocrine surgeon (procedure),Endocrine surgeon discharged patient,"This documentation clearly identifies a discharge procedure and assigns the action to an endocrine surgeon, aligning exactly with the concept. The main concept is discharge; the explicit attribute is the discharging provider type (endocrine surgeon). The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 306472005 is the most precise code because it captures both the discharge and that it was by an endocrine surgeon. Broader parents like “Discharge (procedure)” or other provider-specific siblings do not fit as well. The wording is a direct, clinician-documentation style statement without adding destination, timing, or other attributes."
394877006,Family history: Alzheimer's disease (situation),Intake history: family history of Alzheimer's disease,"Here, the intake note records that the family history includes Alzheimer’s disease, indicating a family-history situation. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation with explicit context, best matched by Family history: Alzheimer's disease (SCTID 394877006). There is no mention of which relative or extent, so child concepts are excluded. Broader parent/sibling concepts (e.g., family history of dementia) would not capture the specified condition. The intake context does not alter or add attributes to the core concept."
242922002,Assault involving moving vehicles (event),Patient states: assaulted by a moving vehicle,"The patient-reported statement expresses that the assault was carried out using a moving vehicle, which is directly equivalent to the concept. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps precisely to SCTID 242922002, differentiating it from accidental transport events and from generic assault without vehicle involvement. No additional attributes (injury, severity, timing, type of vehicle) are included, making parent concepts too broad and child concepts too specific."
121009003,Erythrocyte antigen (substance),Antigen of the red blood cell,"The wording points to an antigen associated with red blood cells, functionally identical to erythrocyte antigen. This is a Substance concept. The best mapping is to Erythrocyte antigen (substance) because it captures RBC-specific antigens without specifying a subtype. Broader antigen concepts omit the RBC context, and more specific named antigens are not implied. The entry does not introduce timing, severity, or other attributes."
411683004,Egg white diagnostic allergen extract (product),Egg albumen diagnostic allergen extract,"“Egg albumen” is a clinically accepted synonym for egg white, and the phrase specifies a diagnostic allergen extract, matching SNOMED CT 411683004. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). It avoids introducing attributes like concentration or method. Parent diagnostic allergen extract concepts are too broad, and siblings (egg yolk or whole egg) differ in source. The synonym does not change the code choice because albumen precisely means egg white."
309049000,Lesion specimen (specimen),Case file includes a lesion specimen,"This statement documents the presence of a specimen derived from a lesion in the case file, without specifying site, material, or collection method. In SNOMED CT, it is part of the Specimen hierarchy and matches Lesion specimen (specimen) [309049000]. Procedural codes (e.g., biopsy) or more specific specimen subtypes are not indicated, making this code the most accurate representation."
736059007,Angina self management plan (record artifact),Angina self-management plan document,"This explicitly references the document that constitutes a self-management plan for angina, clearly pointing to a record artifact rather than a clinical state. It belongs to the Record artifact category. SCTID 736059007 precisely represents an angina self-management plan. Coding to broader document types or generic self-management plan concepts would lose the angina specificity, while coding to angina clinical findings or procedures would be incorrect because the entry is about the plan document, not diagnosis or intervention."
462680000,"Infusion pump management unit, mobile (physical object)",Equipment list entry: mobile infusion pump management unit,"The phrase references the same physical object in an inventory/documentation context, with explicit mobility. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The context (“equipment list entry”) does not change the device identity; the core term remains a mobile management unit for infusion pumps. This excludes more generic or stationary management units and is not the pump itself. SCTID 462680000 is the appropriate code."
1306650005,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with lips closed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Imaging report: extraoral photo—left hemiface; lips closed; jaws in centric relation.,"This indicates a documented extraoral photographic record of the left hemiface with lips closed and jaws in centric relation, aligning to a specific record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 1306650005 is exact for this specification. A parent concept would lack laterality and mouth/jaw details, and sibling concepts (right hemiface or different jaw relation) would be incorrect. The use of “hemiface” and “photo” are acceptable synonyms and do not introduce additional attributes."
764374006,Product containing adrenergic receptor agonist (product),Adrenergic receptor agonist medication,"This phrase identifies a medication (i.e., product) whose pharmacologic class is adrenergic receptor agonist, with no further details about subtype, formulation, or named ingredient. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It matches 'Product containing adrenergic receptor agonist (product)' because the term 'medication' denotes a product and 'adrenergic receptor agonist' denotes the contained class. Choosing a parent product class would be too general, and selecting a child such as beta- or alpha-adrenergic agonist products would add specificity not present in the text. The synonym usage is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
469644001,"Humerus nail, sterile (physical object)",Preoperative checklist: sterile humerus nail,"This indicates a preoperative supply check, but the concept explicitly referenced is a sterile humerus nail. It is a Physical object (device) and matches Humerus nail, sterile (physical object), SCTID 469644001. Broader parents (sterile bone nail) or unspecified sterility humerus nails are less precise. No wording suggests a procedure (insertion) or a finding (presence), and no child-level attributes (locking, size, material) are added, making 469644001 the correct, most specific mapping."
74782004,Product containing naturally occurring alkaloid (product),Formulary entry: naturally occurring alkaloid–containing product,"This formulary-oriented statement still denotes a product whose ingredient is a naturally occurring alkaloid, which maps to SCTID 74782004 in the Product hierarchy. The context does not add attributes such as precise strength or route; the core remains the ingredient-class product. Parent concepts that lack the natural qualifier are less precise; child concepts tied to specific alkaloids or detailed clinical drug definitions are too narrow. Substance-only codes are not appropriate because a product is explicitly referenced."
346467003,Horse dander allergy vaccine (product),Horse epithelium allergy vaccine,"In allergen nomenclature, “epithelium” is used synonymously with “dander” for animal skin/hair-derived allergen sources, so “horse epithelium” is clinically equivalent to horse dander. This references the same allergy vaccine product, a SNOMED Product concept. No form, route, or mixture is added. Parent concepts are overbroad, and sibling concepts for other species do not apply. This synonym does not alter the intended code; SCTID 346467003 is the precise match."
788252001,Entire hair follicle of temporal region of face (body structure),Entire hair follicle of temporal region of face,"The entry explicitly states the whole hair follicle and the precise anatomical location as the temporal region of the face, matching the preferred term. This is a Body structure in SNOMED CT, and the concept 'Entire hair follicle of temporal region of face' (SCTID: 788252001) is the most specific fit. More general parent structures (e.g., hair follicle of face or temporal region of face without 'entire') do not capture the 'entire' qualifier, and child/sibling concepts targeting parts of the follicle (e.g., outer root sheath) or different regions (e.g., scalp) would be inaccurate. No additional attributes (laterality, pathology, timing) are introduced."
278020009,Spot urine specimen (specimen),We obtained a spot urine specimen,"The statement identifies the obtained specimen as a spot urine sample, i.e., a single, untimed urine collection, and adds no other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Spot urine specimen (278020009) precisely represents this type. Parent concepts like Urine specimen lack the spot specificity, while siblings that define timing or collection technique would misrepresent the described specimen."
63143001,Eucalyptus cladocalyx (organism),Patient reports the species name as Eucalyptus cladocalyx,"A patient-reported context still names the organism Eucalyptus cladocalyx, preserving the species-level Organism concept and mapping to SCTID 63143001. The statement does not add exposure, allergy, or clinical findings—only the identity of the organism. Parent genus concepts are too general, and sibling species do not match the reported species, so the exact species concept is most appropriate."
384960007,Surgical margin involved by malignant neoplasm in excised tissue specimen (observable entity),Specimen margin status: positive (malignant neoplasm),"This presents a margin status result for an excised specimen that is positive specifically for malignant neoplasm, denoting margin involvement. It is an Observable entity. SCTID 384960007 is the most precise code because it encodes surgical margin involvement due to malignant neoplasm on excised tissue. More general parent concepts like positive margin without malignancy are less specific, and siblings such as negative margin or non-malignant causes would be incorrect. The parenthetical clarifies the malignancy without adding extraneous attributes."
427221004,Therapeutic substance unit characteristic (observable entity),Therapeutic substance unit descriptor,"The term 'descriptor' functions as a synonym for 'characteristic' in an observable context and preserves the unit-level scope tied to a therapeutic substance. No concrete descriptor values are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It aligns with 427221004 because it denotes the unit characteristic observable. Parent observables would be less specific than unit-level, and child concepts naming individual descriptors (e.g., unit strength) would add specificity not present here."
74056004,Orphanage (environment),Service location: orphanage,"The entry identifies the service location as an orphanage, which is a specific environment. The proper code is Orphanage (environment) [74056004], categorized as Environment. A broader 'service location: institution' would be parent-level. The phrasing does not assert residence or any clinical finding, keeping the mapping strictly environmental."
121291002,3-Hydroxyglutarate measurement (procedure),3-hydroxyglutarate assay,"The phrase identifies an assay—i.e., a laboratory measurement—of 3-hydroxyglutarate, which is semantically equivalent to a measurement of that analyte. The main concept is a procedural laboratory test of this single substance. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This best maps to 3-Hydroxyglutarate measurement (procedure) because 'assay' in lab parlance denotes a measurement/test; it does not add attributes like specimen or technique. Parent concepts such as generic substance measurement are too broad, and children that specify specimen, method, or quantitative subtype are not implied by the entry. Sibling analyte measurements are excluded by the explicit naming of 3-hydroxyglutarate."
773506001,Gynecology care plan (record artifact),Plan of care—gynecology,"This wording identifies a plan of care with the gynecology domain. It is a Record artifact and fits Gynecology care plan (773506001). A parent concept like Care plan lacks the gynecology qualifier, and sibling domain plans (e.g., obstetric) are not supported by the text."
442390005,Reconstruction of oral cavity (procedure),Reconstructive surgery of the mouth,"This entry conveys reconstructive surgery with the target anatomy being the mouth (oral cavity). The main concept is a reconstruction procedure, and no details about materials, extent, or specific subsites are included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The best code is SCTID 442390005 because it precisely represents reconstruction of the oral cavity. Parent concepts like general oral surgery or head and neck procedures are too broad; child concepts such as reconstruction of lips or palate are too narrow. The mouth/oral cavity synonymy is clinically standard, and the phrasing does not add attributes like timing or cause."
272504001,Agricultural site (environment),Documented environment is an agricultural site,"The statement identifies the environment as an agricultural site and includes no additional attributes. The concept is purely environmental. Category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 272504001 is the precise match, as neither a generic parent nor a more specific child (farm, orchard, pasture) is justified by the wording. The documentation phrasing does not alter the semantic scope."
254387007,Human immunodeficiency virus infection classification systems (staging scale),HIV disease classification systems for staging,"The entry describes classification systems applied for staging HIV disease, emphasizing the system rather than any result or diagnosis. The SNOMED CT category is Assessment scale (staging scale). The most precise code is SCTID 254387007 since it represents generic HIV infection classification systems (staging scale). Using a parent concept for staging systems would be overly broad, and referencing named systems would map to child concepts. The synonym 'classification systems for staging' is clinically equivalent to 'staging scale'."
287957006,Facial bone foreign body removed (situation),Foreign body from facial bones has been removed.,"The wording emphasizes that the foreign body associated with the facial bones has been removed, which is a status statement. SNOMED CT category: Situation. It precisely matches the “Facial bone foreign body removed” concept and is more accurate than a generic removal situation or a procedure code. It does not introduce details like specific facial bones, laterality, or method, preserving the correct situation mapping."
214834003,"Motor vehicle nontraffic accident involving collision, not on public highway, between motor vehicle, except off-road motor vehicle, and animal (event)",Motor vehicle collision with animal within gated community (off public highway),"This entry indicates a motor vehicle collision with an animal within a gated community, explicitly off a public highway, thus nontraffic. Category: Event. It fits SNOMED CT 214834003 by stating collision partner (animal) and nontraffic location with a standard motor vehicle. Parents are too broad; siblings such as traffic accidents or off-road vehicle collisions do not match the stated context. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not add other attributes."
304971005,Entire head of fourth rib (body structure),Whole head of fourth rib,"Main concept: the entire (whole) head of the fourth rib. Attributes: head subpart; fourth rib ordinal; scope explicitly ‘whole/entire.’ SNOMED CT category: Body structure. ‘Whole’ is a straightforward synonym for ‘entire,’ reinforcing that the full anatomical head is intended, which maps to SCTID 304971005. Using a parent like ‘Head of rib’ would miss the ordinal, and selecting subcomponents (e.g., specific articular surfaces) would be too narrow. No laterality or disease context is present."
2531000181101,Urine specimen obtained after prostatic massage (specimen),After prostatic massage urine specimen,"The main concept is a urine specimen and the qualifier is that it was collected after prostatic massage. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This is a precise representation of urine obtained post–prostatic massage. A parent code for urine alone would miss the defining post-massage context, while siblings for other specimen types or timings would not match. The phrasing is synonymous and introduces no added attributes."
255926003,"2,2-di(4-methacryloxyphenyl)propane (substance)","2,2-bis(4-methacryloxy phenyl)propane","This synonym uses 'bis' and minor spacing variation while preserving the exact structural meaning of the compound, referring to 2,2-di(4-methacryloxyphenyl)propane. It identifies the Substance without suggesting role or clinical use. Broader or different compounds (e.g., Bis-GMA or bisphenol A itself) would not be precise matches. The correct mapping is SNOMED CT 255926003."
225593006,Smearing of feces (finding),Smearing with feces,"The wording 'smearing with feces' clearly conveys the action of using feces to smear, directly matching the Clinical finding of smearing of feces. There is no mention of cause, timing, or severity. It does not imply accidental soiling or incontinence, making sibling concepts inappropriate. The concept aligns exactly with SNOMED CT 225593006, rather than a parent category or alternative fecal behaviors."
1362038009,Shaffer gonioscopy grading system (staging scale),Shaffer angle grading scale for gonioscopy,"This phrasing identifies the named scale used to grade the angle during gonioscopy, i.e., the Shaffer system. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale. It aligns with the concept of the scale itself rather than the gonioscopy procedure or a finding. It does not introduce attributes like grade level, laterality, or severity. Broader parent scales would be less precise, and siblings such as Scheie or Spaeth classifications are not referenced."
305649007,Seen by neonatologist (finding),Record notes: seen by neonatologist,"This indicates the patient was seen by a neonatologist per the record, with the only attribute being the clinician type. It fits the Clinical finding category and maps to SCTID 305649007. A parent concept would be too general, while siblings (e.g., other specialties) would misclassify. There is no implication of a consultation or procedural exam, so the ‘seen by neonatologist’ finding is the most precise match."
38200006,Structure of dorsal cutaneous nerve of foot (body structure),Anatomical landmark: dorsal cutaneous nerve of foot,"This entry references the same anatomical structure as a landmark, without adding diagnostic, laterality, or branch details. The main concept is the dorsal cutaneous nerve of the foot; SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 38200006 is exact. No child branch (medial/intermediate) or procedure is implied, so sibling or parent concepts are less appropriate. The 'landmark' context does not alter the coded structure."
224721005,Straight corridor (environment),Access route described as a straight corridor,"The entry defines an access route and explicitly describes it as a straight corridor, with no other attributes added. Main concept: straight corridor. SNOMED CT category: Environment. Straight corridor (environment) (SCTID: 224721005) is the precise code because it captures both the corridor feature and the straightness. Using the parent Corridor (environment) would fail to encode the straight attribute, and selecting a sibling with curvature would be inaccurate. The access route context is informational only and does not change the environmental feature being documented."
423529002,Genus Irena (organism),Irena — genus-level organism,"This entry identifies Irena and clarifies that it is at the genus level, without introducing any other attributes. The central concept is the genus Irena. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, with 423529002 Genus Irena (organism) being the precise mapping. Parent concepts like family or broader bird taxa are not specified here, and species-level child concepts within Irena are not mentioned, making them less appropriate. The phrase “genus-level organism” is a clarifying synonym that maintains the same code selection."
45374000,Plasmodium gallinaceum (organism),History entry: Plasmodium gallinaceum,"This history note references the organism Plasmodium gallinaceum by name. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The wording provides no clinical attributes beyond the species designation, so it matches concept 45374000. A parent concept such as ‘Plasmodium (organism)’ is too broad, and any sibling species would be inaccurate, making the exact species the correct code."
119386002,Specimen from prostate (specimen),Specimen origin is the prostate gland,"By identifying the specimen origin as the prostate gland, the entry specifies the exact organ source without introducing type or method. This is a Specimen category concept and maps to Specimen from prostate (specimen), SCTID 119386002. Using 'gland' is a clinically equivalent synonym for the prostate and does not change code selection. Child concepts would require details like tissue or biopsy, which are absent."
1156613004,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of anus at circumferential surgical margin in anal resection specimen (observable entity),Pathology synoptic field: presence of primary anal malignancy at circumferential surgical margin (anal resection specimen),"This describes a synoptic pathology field (observable parameter) for assessing whether the primary anal malignancy is present at the circumferential surgical margin in an anal resection specimen. The main concept is presence-of-primary anal cancer at the circumferential margin. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. The wording maps directly to SCTID 1156613004; it specifies site (anus), tumor status (primary malignant neoplasm), margin type (circumferential), and specimen context (anal resection). More general margin status parameters or observables for other sites/margins are less precise and therefore not selected."
423573003,Details of stairs in home (observable entity),Care plan focus: details of stairs at home,"Within a care plan context, the focus is the observable 'details of stairs at home,' aligning with SNOMED CT 423573003 (Observable entity). No specific stair characteristics are presented, keeping it at the appropriate level of generality. Parent concepts about broad home environment details would be less precise, and child concepts that capture particular stair features would be too specific. Sibling observables concerning other home fixtures are different in target. The paraphrase maintains equivalence without adding attributes."
1293231009,Entire flexor tendon within thigh (body structure),Anatomy reviewed: entire flexor tendon within thigh,"The phrase documents review of the complete flexor tendon in the thigh, focusing solely on the anatomical entity. Category: Body structure (Anatomical structure). The completeness ('entire') and location ('within thigh') match the concept and avoid any additional clinical attributes. Parent concepts missing the 'entire' aspect or siblings representing other tendon groups would not capture the intended anatomy."
701077002,Respiratory apnea monitoring system (physical object),Respiratory apnea monitoring system ordered,"The wording reflects an order status for the physical device that monitors respiratory apnea, focusing on the equipment identity rather than any clinical procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The ordering context does not change the device type or introduce attributes such as patient age or environment. Parent terms such as general respiratory monitoring equipment are too broad, and siblings like therapeutic devices or sleep-lab systems are not indicated. The specific respiratory apnea monitoring system concept is the best fit."
368197000,Entire skeletal muscle of shoulder (body structure),Entire shoulder skeletal muscle anatomy,"This entry identifies the anatomical structure as the complete shoulder skeletal muscle. There are no added findings, procedures, or laterality. It corresponds most precisely to the Body structure “Entire skeletal muscle of shoulder” (SCTID: 368197000). A parent lacking the entire qualifier or a sibling concept not restricted to skeletal muscle would not match as well. The wording is a direct synonym preserving scope and specificity."
244676001,Entire anterior fossa of cranial cavity (body structure),Fossa cranii anterior,"This is the Latin anatomical synonym for the anterior cranial fossa and refers to the entire fossa as a Body structure. SCTID 244676001 matches most precisely because it encodes the whole anterior fossa of the cranial cavity. Parent concepts (cranial cavity structures) are too general, and sibling structures (middle/posterior cranial fossae) describe different regions. There is no indication of a segment or subportion, so child concepts would be less appropriate. The Latin synonym does not alter attributes and is clinically equivalent."
305245007,Admission by neonatologist (procedure),Admitting physician: neonatologist,"The phrase identifies the admitting provider as a neonatologist, which implies the admission procedure was performed by a neonatologist, with no extraneous attributes. This is a provider-specific admission, a Procedure, and maps precisely to SCTID 305245007. General admission parent concepts do not capture the provider role, and sibling concepts involving other admitting providers are not appropriate. No unit or assessment details are included, avoiding child concepts."
439394002,Measurement of hydromorphone in urine (procedure),Hydromorphone in urine—measurement,"The entry explicitly frames a measurement of hydromorphone in urine, i.e., a lab procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 439394002 is the best fit, being specific to hydromorphone and urine. It excludes broader parents, avoids siblings such as detection-only tests, and does not imply method-based children like chromatography or mass spectrometry."
224045000,Connecticut (geographic location),Patient-reported location: Connecticut,"This patient statement context names Connecticut as the location, without adding granularity or other attributes to the place itself. The SNOMED CT category is Location/Geographic location. “Connecticut (geographic location)” SCTID 224045000 fits best; parent or child concepts would misrepresent the specified state."
122708000,Specimen from ovary obtained by biopsy (specimen),Specimen submitted: ovarian biopsy,"This entry documents that a submitted specimen is an ovarian biopsy, which refers to material obtained from the ovary via biopsy. The main concepts are specimen (entity), ovary (anatomic source), and biopsy (method). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the precise match is “Specimen from ovary obtained by biopsy” SCTID 122708000. While brief, it clearly describes the specimen rather than the procedure. It excludes laterality, subtype, or processing details, avoiding child or sibling concepts. Parent concepts lacking the biopsy attribute are too general, so 122708000 is the correct selection."
118352001,Ultraviolet laser light (physical force),Ultraviolet laser beam documented,"This documentation phrase refers to an ultraviolet laser beam, which is equivalent to ultraviolet laser light; 'documented' adds only context without altering the physical force specified. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. SCTID 118352001 is the correct selection because the wording includes both the laser source and ultraviolet spectrum. Broader parent concepts (generic laser beam/light) or sibling concepts (ultraviolet beam/light not from a laser) would be less precise."
313868001,Serum alpha-fetoprotein multiple of median measurement (procedure),Serum AFP MoM test performed,"This indicates that the test to measure alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) MoM in serum has been carried out. The main concept is a procedural laboratory measurement with serum as the specimen and MoM as the measurement format. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It cleanly maps to SCTID 313868001. Parent concepts like AFP testing or AFP MoM without serum are less specific, and sibling concepts involving other specimen types do not match. Because the phrase describes a test performed rather than a numeric result, it should not be coded to an observable entity."
308364004,Research administrative procedure (procedure),Patient report: I completed the research administrative procedure,"This patient-reported statement indicates completion of an administrative procedure tied to research. It remains a SNOMED CT Procedure and fits “Research administrative procedure” [308364004]. Although voiced by the patient, the described activity is the same administrative research procedure and no additional attributes are introduced. The entry does not specify consent, IRB, or enrollment, avoiding child concepts, and the parent administrative procedure lacks the research qualifier, so 308364004 is most accurate."
56189001,Hospital-based outpatient obstetrical clinic (environment),Hospital outpatient clinic — obstetrics,"This specifies a hospital outpatient clinic with obstetrics as the specialty, describing the environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 56189001 is the correct code because the setting is a hospital-based outpatient obstetrical clinic. A parent concept like 'hospital outpatient clinic' lacks the specialty detail; 'obstetrical clinic' alone would not guarantee hospital-based outpatient status. Sibling entries (e.g., gynecology clinic, antenatal clinic) introduce different scopes and are not implied."
224687002,Prison hospital (environment),Bedside evaluation in the prison hospital,"This indicates that the evaluation occurred within the environment of a prison hospital. The clinical activity is context; the location is the codable concept. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, with Prison hospital (environment) [224687002] as the specific match. Parent concepts would not capture the dual nature (prison + hospital), and the wording does not narrow to a ward or infirmary, confirming 224687002."
13872000,Blood group antibody Fuller (substance),Fuller (blood-group) antibody reference,"The wording references the Fuller blood-group antibody as a concept without asserting detection or clinical status, indicating the antibody substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The most specific match is 13872000 Blood group antibody Fuller (substance). A general parent would be insufficiently specific, and siblings are different named antibodies. The inclusion of 'reference' reflects documentation context and does not introduce attributes (e.g., presence or titer), leaving the substance unchanged."
411649006,Capsicum frutescens diagnostic allergen extract (product),Ordered: Capsicum frutescens diagnostic allergen extract for testing,"The entry indicates an order for the product Capsicum frutescens diagnostic allergen extract, specifying its diagnostic testing purpose. The primary concept is the product, category Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). Including 'for testing' aligns with diagnostic use and does not introduce procedural details that would change coding; it remains the exact concept 411649006 rather than a generic or substance-only concept."
56886006,Strontium compound (substance),Formulary ingredient class: strontium compound,"This entry identifies the generic ingredient class as ‘strontium compound’, which aligns with the SNOMED CT Substance concept (56886006). It does not specify a particular derivative or formulation and adds no clinical attributes. Parents lacking the strontium qualifier are too broad; children naming specific strontium salts or compounds would be overly specific compared to this class-level wording."
430801003,Family history of pulmonary embolism (situation),Pedigree indicates family history of pulmonary embolism,"Referencing a pedigree still indicates only that pulmonary embolism is present in the family history, without identifying degree of relation or adding other qualifiers. This is a Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT 430801003 is the best match, encoding family history of PE. Parent concepts are overly general, and sibling family history of venous thromboembolism is broader than the precise condition. Personal-history siblings do not apply. The wording remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term without adding attributes."
130028005,Toluene dioxygenase (substance),Toluene dioxygenase mentioned in the report,"The phrase indicates that 'toluene dioxygenase' is referenced, while the core concept is the named substance itself. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Substance category and maps to SCTID 130028005. The documentation context does not add attributes of use, dosage, allergy, or levels. Broader or alternate enzyme concepts are not invoked. Hence, the correct and unique code is the toluene dioxygenase substance."
789133007,Mirrored visible image uncorrected flipped vertically (record artifact),Clinician documentation: uncorrected vertically flipped mirror image in the record.,"This documentation specifies a mirror image that is vertically flipped and uncorrected within the record, matching the concept SCTID 789133007. Category: Record artifact. Vertical orientation is required for this code and is present; using a parent concept would lose that detail. Horizontal or other orientation artifacts would be siblings and are excluded by the wording. The phrasing stays within the artifact description without extra attributes."
419304003,Product containing melatonin agonist (product),Melatonin receptor agonist-containing medication,"This entry denotes a medication product that contains a melatonin receptor agonist, directly aligning with the SNOMED CT product concept “Product containing melatonin agonist (product)” SCTID 419304003. It refrains from specifying dose, route, form, brand, or a particular ingredient, so selecting a child clinical drug concept would be over-specific. A substance concept would be incorrect because the phrasing is about a medication product. Siblings that name specific melatonin agonists do not match the general class reference. The hyphenated “agonist-containing” is a clinically equivalent way to convey the same product class."
441749007,Specimen from submandibular gland obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Pathology requisition: submandibular gland FNAB specimen,"This requisition labels a specimen obtained by FNAB from the submandibular gland. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It corresponds to 441749007 through precise identification of both site and fine needle aspiration biopsy method, with no added attributes. It is more specific than salivary gland FNA parent concepts and does not match siblings like parotid or core biopsy specimens. 'FNAB specimen' is a clinically equivalent synonym that maintains the same coding."
236448000,Small kidney (finding),Findings: small kidney,"This report-style entry states the finding of a small kidney, with no further attributes like side, etiology, or severity. The concept is a Clinical finding of reduced renal size. Small kidney (finding) SCTID 236448000 is the exact match. Using a parent like abnormal kidney size would lack specificity, and selecting laterality children would be incorrect due to no side being mentioned. Siblings such as atrophic kidney or hypoplastic kidney change the clinical meaning and are not implied."
310479003,History of iritis (situation),Documented history of iritis,"The phrase indicates a prior episode of iritis that is documented in the record, signifying past occurrence. This fits the Situation with explicit context category. History of iritis (situation) [310479003] is the most accurate mapping. Coding to Iritis (disorder) would suggest an active disease state, which is not conveyed. Using a broader history-of-eye-disease concept would lose specificity. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym of history-of and adds no severity, laterality, or cause."
223717005,Colombia (geographic location),Place name: Colombia,"This entry identifies Colombia as a place name, focusing on the geographic entity itself. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Geographic location within the Location/Qualifier value hierarchy, and SCTID 223717005 'Colombia (geographic location)' is the exact match. It neither adds attributes (e.g., birthplace, residence) nor narrows to sublocations, so coding to the country concept is most precise."
66678007,Disease type AND/OR category not assigned (situation),Disease category remains unassigned.,"This sentence communicates that the disease category has not yet been assigned and continues in that state, strictly about classification. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 66678007 fits because it covers type and/or category not assigned. More general situation concepts lack specificity, and alternatives like 'category assigned' or disorder-level unspecified terms would be inaccurate for the described classification status."
368932009,Entire head of stapes (body structure),Middle ear ossicle—head of stapes,"By specifying the middle ear ossicle and its head, the entry identifies the head of the stapes, mapping to the SNOMED CT Body structure 'Entire head of stapes' (368932009). Mentioning 'middle ear ossicle' is descriptive context and does not change the coded concept. It remains specific to the head segment, not the entire stapes or other segments, so the head-specific code is the precise match."
83064007,Hemoglobin J-Guantanamo (substance),Component: Hemoglobin J-Guantanamo,"Labeling it as a component in a test context still identifies only the named hemoglobin substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; SCTID 83064007 corresponds exactly. No extra attributes such as positivity, trait, or chain specificity are stated, avoiding misclassification to findings or other substances. Parents and siblings would be less accurate."
788617003,Structure of tracheal perichondrium (body structure),Perichondrial covering of tracheal cartilage,"The concept here is the fibrous covering (perichondrium) of the tracheal cartilage, an anatomical Body structure. ‘Covering’ is a standard descriptive synonym for perichondrium, and coupling it with ‘tracheal cartilage’ makes it uniquely map to SCTID 788617003. Parent concepts lacking tracheal specificity or siblings describing different layers (e.g., cartilage itself) would not be precise. There are no added attributes beyond the anatomy."
223846008,Formentera (geographic location),Place visited: Formentera,"The entry frames Formentera as a visited place, but the coded concept remains the geographic location itself. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The best match is Formentera (geographic location), SCTID 223846008. The visitation context does not add attributes that would change the target concept to a situation or event; it remains a pure location. Parent regions or specific sublocalities are not implied, keeping the code precise."
726435001,Subcutaneous mastectomy of left breast (procedure),Clinical note: left subcutaneous mastectomy,"The clinical note succinctly records a left-sided subcutaneous mastectomy, preserving exact technique and laterality without extra qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 726435001 is the appropriate code because it embodies subcutaneous mastectomy of the left breast. Broader parent concepts lack specificity, and siblings like right subcutaneous mastectomy or other mastectomy types would be inconsistent with the text."
426927003,Excision of lesion of infratemporal fossa (procedure),Clinic note: infratemporal fossa lesion removal by excision,"This clinic note specifies removal of an infratemporal fossa lesion via excision. Category: Procedure. It maps to SNOMED CT 426927003 due to explicit action and site. Choosing a parent (generic lesion excision) would be less precise, and siblings/children (e.g., biopsy, neoplasm excision, lateralized procedures) are excluded because the wording does not add those attributes. 'Removal by excision' is a clinically equivalent phrasing for excision."
285386001,Right sided chest pain (finding),Triage note: right-sided chest pain,"This triage note records the clinical finding of chest pain on the right side. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 285386001 is correct because it captures the right-sided localization of chest pain. A generic chest pain concept would omit laterality, and children with additional sublocations or features are not described. The note does not add severity, timing, or causative details, preserving the exact concept."
181715003,Entire lumbrical muscle of foot (body structure),Lumbrical muscle of foot — entire structure,"The entry explicitly identifies the lumbrical muscle of the foot and specifies “entire structure,” making it clear that the whole muscle is in scope. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This wording is a clinically equivalent synonym to SCTID 181715003, and the “entire” modifier prevents mapping to parent concepts like “structure of lumbrical muscle of foot” or more general “muscle of foot.” It also avoids child concepts that introduce ordinal specificity and does not imply any pathology or procedure."
17102003,"Nasogastric tube, device (physical object)","Nasogastric tube, device","The entry names the physical object as a nasogastric tube, which is a device routed via the nasal passage into the stomach. Category: Physical object (Device). This wording maps precisely to SNOMED CT concept 17102003, Nasogastric tube, device (physical object), because it identifies the generic device type without adding attributes such as size, brand, function, or clinical status. Parent concepts like generic tube device or enteral access device are broader and do not specify the nasogastric route, making them less precise. Sibling devices such as orogastric tubes or nasojejunal tubes involve different routes or destinations and would be inaccurate. No child subtype (e.g., Salem sump or Levin) is implied, so the general nasogastric tube device concept is the best match."
1306664005,Photographic extraoral image of full face with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Orthodontic records: extraoral full-face photo—full smile with teeth in centric occlusion.,"The content is an extraoral full-face photo with full smile and teeth in centric occlusion; the mention of orthodontic records provides context but does not change the artifact type. It belongs to the Record artifact category and maps specifically to SCTID 1306664005. Parent artifacts are less specific, and siblings alter the view or smile posture. The synonyms used are clinically safe and equivalent."
122722000,Specimen from right fallopian tube obtained by salpingo-oophorectomy (specimen),"Histology specimen from right fallopian tube, collected at salpingo-oophorectomy","This phrasing indicates a histologic specimen (still within the generic specimen concept) from the right fallopian tube, with collection during salpingo-oophorectomy. The main concept is a specimen; attributes include site (right fallopian tube) and method (salpingo-oophorectomy). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 122722000 is the most precise match because it specifies both laterality and the obtaining procedure. Concepts that omit laterality or the specific collecting procedure are less appropriate, and those referencing ovary or different surgical methods (e.g., salpingectomy alone) would not match. 'Histology specimen' is a common documentation synonym for tissue specimen and does not add new attributes."
285329006,Argon laser light (physical force),Patient mentions ‘argon laser light’,"This patient-reported statement simply cites the term 'argon laser light' and focuses on the physical force without implying a procedure or exposure event. The main concept is argon laser light; no added attributes are included. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. The wording remains specific to argon laser light and does not suggest a device or treatment, so the best code is Argon laser light (physical force) rather than parent laser light or other laser types."
258585008,Bone marrow trephine specimen (specimen),Bone marrow trephine tissue sample,"The entry indicates a tissue sample from bone marrow obtained by trephine, i.e., a core biopsy specimen. The main concept is a Specimen; there are no added attributes like anatomical subsite, fixation, or timing. The most precise SNOMED CT code is Bone marrow trephine specimen (258585008). Using 'tissue sample' as wording remains within the specimen concept and does not suggest alternative specimens such as aspirate or smear. Parents and siblings are less appropriate because they are either more general or denote different marrow specimen types."
223584007,Republic of Korea (geographic location),Encounter occurred in: Republic of Korea,"The context references an encounter, but the coded value is the country as a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223584007 precisely identifies the Republic of Korea. Parent concepts like general location are too broad; sibling/child locations are not named. The phrasing does not introduce a different concept; it preserves the geographic location semantics."
1260022006,Excision of pressure injury stage III of ischial region with excision of ischium and primary closure using suture (procedure),Ischial region stage III pressure injury excision plus ischium excision; primary closure using sutures,"The statement includes excision of a stage III pressure injury localized to the ischial region, excision of the ischium bone, and primary closure with sutures, meeting the exact procedural definition. It is categorized as a Procedure in SNOMED CT. The wording ensures specificity about stage, site, and closure method, making it more exact than parent concepts lacking one of these elements and not mapping to siblings that differ in closure technique or anatomical site."
116543002,Alatrofloxacin mesilate (substance),Reference standard: alatrofloxacin mesylate,"Calling it a reference standard pertains to the substance used as a standard, still describing the chemical entity. The SNOMED CT category remains Substance, and the specific salt aligns with 116543002. The entry does not introduce dose, route, or product formulation, avoiding product or finding hierarchies; the salt designation distinguishes it from the base alatrofloxacin substance."
730067007,Entire branch of ascending pharyngeal artery (body structure),Ascending pharyngeal artery branch,"This phrase is a direct synonym of 'branch of ascending pharyngeal artery', referring to the same anatomical unit and mapping to Entire branch of ascending pharyngeal artery (SCTID 730067007). The SNOMED CT category is Body structure (anatomical structure). It does not imply the whole ascending pharyngeal artery (parent) or any particular named branch (children). No contextual qualifiers (e.g., right/left, proximal/distal, disease state, or procedure) are introduced. The inversion of word order is a common clinical shorthand and is semantically equivalent, so it does not alter code selection. More general artery branch concepts or branches of other external carotid divisions would be less appropriate."
422705004,Corynebacterium sphenisci (organism),Sample organism: Corynebacterium sphenisci,"The entry designates Corynebacterium sphenisci as the organism present in the sample, making the species the coded value. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The sample context does not change the code; it remains the organism. A broader genus code would lose specificity, and a different species would not match. No clinical findings or infection are described."
216076008,Balloon accident (event),Follow-up note references balloon accident,"Follow‑up context is provided, but the central concept remains a balloon accident with no added attributes such as injury, severity, or timing specifics. SNOMED CT category: Event. The appropriate code is Balloon accident (event) [216076008]. General aircraft/transport accident concepts are too broad, and child concepts requiring more detailed circumstances are not supported by the wording. No inference of medical device balloon issues is present."
247676009,Delusion associated with sexual hallucinations (finding),Observation of delusion associated with sexual hallucinations,"The entry indicates an observation of a delusion associated with sexual hallucinations, clearly capturing the combined finding. Concepts: observed delusion and sexual hallucinations linked together. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 247676009 applies because it represents the precise relationship. Coding solely delusion or sexual hallucinations would be less specific. The observational context does not introduce additional attributes and remains within the intended concept scope."
105137007,Clorazepate measurement (procedure),Clorazepate level testing,"The wording indicates a test performed to measure the level of clorazepate, which is procedural. In SNOMED CT, this maps to a Procedure. 105137007 is the most precise match because it refers specifically to the measurement of clorazepate. Broader or different-procedure concepts (screening or generic drug testing) would not be as accurate. The term 'testing' here is a clinically safe synonym for performing a measurement and does not introduce new attributes."
702902006,"Pediatric ear, nose and throat clinic (environment)",Pediatric ORL clinic,"ORL (otorhinolaryngology) is a common synonym for ENT; paired with 'Pediatric,' it denotes the pediatric ENT clinic environment. Category: Environment or geographical location. 'ORL' is clinically equivalent to 'ENT' and 'otolaryngology.' The best fit is Pediatric ear, nose and throat clinic (environment), SCTID 702902006. Parent concepts without the pediatric qualifier or sibling concepts without the specialty would be less accurate. The entry avoids additional attributes such as care type or timing."
717015002,Developmental Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview score (observable entity),3Di score available,"This entry indicates availability of the 3Di score, but the central concept is still the instrument’s score itself, without any numeric value, interpretation, or subscale details. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The best match is SCTID 717015002, the Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview score. Mapping to a documentation status or to the procedure would be less appropriate since the idea expressed is the presence of the specific score."
256246007,Cotton - textile (physical object),Identified material: cotton fabric,"This wording indicates the identified material is cotton fabric, a direct synonym for cotton textile, mapping to SCTID 256246007 (Physical object). It avoids attributes such as intended use, weave, or sterility. Parents like textile alone lack cotton specificity, while siblings such as cotton wool or cotton swabs represent different objects, making them less appropriate."
285406004,High air pressure (physical force),High air pressure observed,"The statement notes that high air pressure was observed, which still denotes the physical force and does not convert it into a clinical finding of harm or an exposure event. It belongs to the Physical force category; High air pressure (physical force) [285406004] is the precise code. Parent categories are too broad without the 'high' specification, and siblings like low air pressure are inconsistent with the entry. 'Observed' is contextual wording and does not change the semantic concept."
257342000,Homograft cardiac valve (physical object),Heart valve allograft,"This entry denotes a heart valve allograft, i.e., a human donor homograft valve device. The main concept is a donor-derived cardiac valve as a physical object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. It corresponds to SCTID 257342000 because “allograft” is the clinically equivalent term for “homograft,” and pairing with “heart valve” specifies the device. Parent concepts like generic heart valve devices are too broad, and children identifying specific valve positions are not indicated. The synonym choice does not introduce additional attributes such as implantation status."
224704001,Shower room (environment),Room: shower room,"The term specifies the room as a 'shower room', directly identifying the environmental concept. Category: Environment or geographical location. It corresponds to 'Shower room (environment)' SCTID 224704001, not to a generic room or another facility type. There are no added qualifiers (e.g., public/private, hospital/home) or associated events. Sibling concepts (bathroom, toilet room) differ in function and fixtures, and child-level distinctions are not asserted."
217347007,"Fumes from combustion of polyvinylchloride and similar material in conflagration, in factory (event)",Airborne combustion byproducts from PVC in factory blaze,"The entry identifies airborne combustion byproducts (fumes) from PVC occurring during a factory blaze, i.e., conflagration. This matches SNOMED CT 217347007 and is categorized as an Event. It includes PVC material, combustion process, large fire context, and factory location. Parent concepts lacking material specificity or siblings tied to other environments would be less precise. 'Combustion byproducts' and 'blaze' are clinically equivalent synonyms for fumes and conflagration, respectively."
406542000,Improvement in friendships and/or relationships (finding),Noted improvement in interpersonal relationships,"The statement indicates an observed improvement in interpersonal relationships, a domain synonymous with friendships/relationships. The main concept is improvement, and the attribute is an observational note without extra details. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 406542000 applies because the improvement pertains specifically to friendships and relationships. Concepts about general psychosocial functioning or specific relationship subtypes would be less accurate. The synonymous use of ‘interpersonal relationships’ is standard and keeps the code selection intact."
57883007,Renin test diet (finding),Renin test diet in place,"This indicates that the renin test diet is currently active for the patient, a dietary status finding. It should be coded to SCTID 57883007 because it is specific to renin testing. It is more precise than a parent like Test diet (finding) and does not include additional attributes such as specific dietary composition or time qualifiers. The wording is a direct synonym describing the same finding without altering its meaning."
42049001,Structure of tunica media of vein (body structure),Region: tunica media of vein,"The core anatomical reference is the tunica media of a vein, which corresponds directly to 'Structure of tunica media of vein' (SCTID 42049001). 'Region' is a neutral contextual label that does not introduce new attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This avoids mapping to broader structures (vein wall or tunica media of blood vessel as parents) or to arterial structures and other venous layers (siblings). No vein is specified, so it is not a child concept. The phrasing preserves the exact structure and code."
789595007,Lasiurus blossevillii (organism),Scientific name recorded as Lasiurus blossevillii,"The phrase documents the scientific name, Lasiurus blossevillii, as the focal concept. The main concept is the organism species, with SNOMED CT category Organism and code SCTID 789595007. Contextual wording ('recorded as') does not introduce other attributes or suggest a different concept. Using the precise binomial ensures we are not selecting a parent like Lasiurus (organism) or a sibling species; it targets the species entry exactly."
314521005,Upper limb joint prosthesis (physical object),Upper limb joint prosthesis,"The entry explicitly denotes a prosthetic device intended for a joint in the upper limb region without specifying a particular joint. The main concept is a device: an artificial joint for the upper extremity. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (Device). The most precise match is Upper limb joint prosthesis (physical object), SCTID 314521005, because the term is region-specific to the upper limb. The parent “Joint prosthesis” is too broad (no region), children such as “Shoulder joint prosthesis” or “Elbow joint prosthesis” are too specific (a joint is not named), and sibling concepts like “Lower limb joint prosthesis” refer to a different region. This phrasing does not imply presence in a patient or a procedure, so findings or procedure concepts are less appropriate."
119297000,Blood specimen (specimen),Sample type: blood,"This phrasing identifies the specimen type as blood in a lab documentation style. It remains within the Specimen category and matches Blood specimen (119297000). No additional attributes about source or fraction are present, avoiding child or sibling concepts such as venous blood specimen or plasma specimen. Parent 'Specimen' is too unspecific."
224007001,St. Thomas (geographic location),Returned from St. Thomas,"The phrase denotes the location “St. Thomas” as the place the person returned from, with no added qualifiers such as nation or administrative type. The main concept is the geographic location name. Category: Geographic location (Qualifier value). The most exact match is St. Thomas (geographic location), SCTID 224007001. Broader parent concepts would be less precise, and more specific child/sibling concepts require additional details not present. The context of return travel does not modify the identity of the geographic location itself."
388894002,Genus Cabassous (organism),Genus Cabassous recorded,"The phrase records the genus Cabassous, clearly indicating the taxonomic rank and the organism name. The correct SNOMED CT category is Organism, genus level. It is not a species-level identification, nor does it generalize to the family/order level, making parent concepts too broad and child species too narrow. The verb is contextual and does not change the concept selection."
223538002,Uganda (geographic location),Uganda (nation),"The term ‘nation’ is a clinically safe synonym for ‘country’ in this context and denotes the same geographic entity: Uganda. Main concept: country/nation. Category: Geographic location. It maps precisely to Uganda (geographic location), SCTID 223538002, and would not be better coded to any parent (e.g., Africa) or child (e.g., a Ugandan city). The synonym preserves semantics and does not introduce new attributes."
14402002,Wood (substance),Wood referenced in report,"Here, wood is referenced, and no additional clinical attributes (e.g., exposure, reaction, foreign body) are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Wood (substance) [14402002] is the exact code. The wording avoids product terminology and specific forms like wood dust or splinter. Parent concepts would be nonspecific, while child/sibling concepts add details not stated. Therefore, this entry corresponds uniquely to the wood substance concept."
29648001,Capillaria papillosa (organism),Capillaria papillosa on organism panel,"This entry indicates that Capillaria papillosa appears on an organism panel, enumerating the taxonomic name without additional attributes. The main concept is the organism at the species level. The SNOMED CT category is Organism; the most precise match is Capillaria papillosa (organism), SCTID 29648001. Using a broader parent or different sibling species would not reflect the explicit species listed. The panel context does not add clinical attributes such as disease or life stage, so the organism concept is the correct code choice."
1303421001,On maximum tolerated dose of lipid lowering therapy (finding),Maximally tolerated dose of lipid-lowering agents in place,"The entry indicates that the dose of lipid-lowering agents currently used is maximally tolerated. This is a Clinical finding focused on dosing status. It corresponds to SNOMED CT 1303421001, preserving the two key elements (lipid-lowering therapy and maximum tolerated dose). Parent concepts lacking the dosing constraint would be too broad, while children focused on particular classes would be too specific for this wording."
286632006,Ultraviolet B radiation (physical force),Ultraviolet-B radiation,"The term explicitly identifies ultraviolet-B radiation, the specific B sub-band of ultraviolet radiation, without mentioning exposure, source, or clinical outcomes. It maps to the Physical force category in SNOMED CT as Ultraviolet B radiation (physical force), SCTID 286632006. More general parents like Ultraviolet radiation lose specificity, and sibling bands (A or C) are distinct and not intended. The phrasing is a direct synonym that keeps the concept unchanged."
257568008,Bank (environment),Bank facility (environment),"Referring to a 'facility' indicates the physical site of a bank, which is the intended environment captured by SNOMED CT 257568008. Category: Environment or geographical location. 'Facility' is a semantically equivalent synonym to premises/building and does not introduce a narrower child (e.g., 'ATM vestibule') or a different sibling (e.g., 'Blood bank'). Parent concepts like 'Public building' would be too general. The wording remains strictly the environment concept without additional attributes."
12400181000119108,Chronic pain following bilateral total knee arthroplasty (finding),Chronic pain post bilateral TKR surgery.,"The entry indicates chronic pain post bilateral TKR surgery, where TKR is synonymous with total knee arthroplasty and “post” indicates the temporal relationship. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 12400181000119108 is the most precise because it encodes chronic pain following bilateral TKA; generic chronic postoperative pain or unilateral TKR-related chronic pain would be less accurate. No additional attributes beyond those inherent to the concept are present."
298896004,Passive range of elbow extension (observable entity),Passive movement range: elbow extension,"The entry describes the range of elbow extension achieved through passive movement, emphasizing the observable passive ROM for extension. The concept is passive elbow extension range; the category is Observable entity. The code 298896004 fits the exact observable rather than broader or different movement domains (parents/siblings). The wording maintains equivalence and does not add qualifiers, values, or laterality."
431291005,Schleiferilactobacillus perolens (organism),Organism catalog entry—Schleiferilactobacillus perolens,"This denotes a catalog listing that names the organism Schleiferilactobacillus perolens; the main concept is the species-level taxon. It maps to the Organism category in SNOMED CT. SCTID 431291005 is the most accurate match. Broader parents (e.g., genus) are not as specific, and there is no mention of strains or detection that would lead to other concepts. The catalog context is neutral and maintains focus on the organism’s identity."
72228000,Structure of phalanx of middle finger (body structure),Phalanx of third digit (hand),"Main concept: the phalanx belonging to the third digit of the hand, i.e., the middle finger. No segment, laterality, or condition is introduced. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. The clarification “(hand)” disambiguates from toes, keeping the concept aligned with SCTID 72228000. Parent concepts generalize to any finger; children naming specific phalanx levels are too narrow. Sibling concepts for other digits or broader middle finger structures are not suitable given the explicit phalanx focus."
464890009,Vaginal lubricant (physical object),Imaging preparation item: vaginal lubricant,"This describes the preparation item for imaging as a vaginal lubricant, keeping the focus on the object without implying an application procedure or specific composition. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the exact concept is Vaginal lubricant (physical object), SCTID 464890009. The imaging context is situational and does not change the object to a procedure or medicinal product. Mapping to a broader parent like generic lubricant would be less precise, while siblings such as vaginal moisturizer or contraceptive gels are not implied. With no child attributes introduced, this entry cleanly aligns with the given physical object concept."
364701009,Feature of homelessness (observable entity),SDOH: homelessness feature,"The entry situates the feature within social determinants of health (SDOH) but still denotes the observable entity for homelessness itself. It does not provide a result or status. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 364701009 aligns exactly with a homelessness-related feature. Broader SDOH feature concepts would be insufficiently specific, and clinical findings like Homeless would be inappropriate because no condition is asserted. Labeling it as ‘SDOH homelessness feature’ is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the same observable entity."
463459006,Orthopedic wire crimper (physical object),Surgical instrument: orthopedic wire crimper,"The entry indicates the surgical instrument type and specifies it as an orthopedic wire crimper, focusing on the physical object. No procedural details or conditions are added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 463459006 is the exact match; alternatives such as 'orthopedic instrument' are too generic and siblings like 'wire cutter' or 'twister' differ in function. The prefix 'surgical instrument' simply contextualizes the device and does not change the concept."
722174002,Pulmonary medicine service (qualifier value),Pulmonary medicine clinical service,"This entry explicitly states the clinical service in pulmonary medicine and does not add attributes like referral status, consult timing, or location. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value; SCTID 722174002 corresponds exactly to the pulmonary medicine service. More general parents (e.g., clinical service) are too broad, and siblings like respiratory therapy service or thoracic surgery service involve different disciplines. The addition of “clinical” merely clarifies the service nature and does not alter the concept."
608969007,Specimen from skin (specimen),Microbiology: specimen source recorded as skin,"This entry captures that the specimen used in microbiology is sourced from the skin, with no mention of swab or other methods. That maps to SNOMED CT 'Specimen from skin' (SCTID 608969007), a Specimen category concept. Method-specific child concepts are avoided due to lack of technique detail, and parents would be too general."
31716004,"Frozen plasma product, human (product)",Human blood product—frozen plasma,The phrase clearly identifies a human blood product and specifies it as frozen plasma. Category: Product. It maps to 31716004 since the item is a plasma component in frozen state of human origin. The absence of 'fresh frozen' or other modifiers avoids misclassification to sibling/child concepts. This is an acceptable synonymic expression of the same product without procedural or additional attributes.
466817009,Roller conveyor (physical object),Roller conveyor apparatus,"Using 'apparatus' is a clinically acceptable synonym indicating a physical device without changing the mechanism. The concept remains a roller conveyor, categorized as a Physical object. SCTID 466817009 is the correct code, as it specifies rollers. General conveyors lack specificity, and other conveyor types (belt, chain) are excluded. No details about power, size, or context are present, keeping the mapping precise."
223529004,Democratic Republic of the Congo (geographic location),Democratic Republic of the Congo [country name],"Including the bracketed descriptor ‘[country name]’ is a neutral label and does not alter the concept; it still denotes the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a Geographic location (Location). The appropriate code is SCTID 223529004. The entry is not confined to a province or city and does not introduce contextual attributes like travel or residency, so parent/sibling/child concepts are less suitable."
328693004,Gluten-free tea biscuits (product),Nutrition label states: gluten-free tea biscuits,Referencing a nutrition label still identifies the product as gluten-free tea biscuits. Category: Product. The concept matches SNOMED CT Gluten-free tea biscuits (SCTID 328693004). No new attributes are introduced beyond the gluten-free property and tea biscuit subtype. Parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate because they either omit gluten-free status or represent different product types. The labeling context does not alter the product coding.
68507003,Anolis (organism),Genus: Anolis,"This is a label-format entry explicitly specifying the genus Anolis, without additional clinical qualifiers or context. The main concept is the organism taxon at genus rank. In SNOMED CT, Organism is the correct category, with Anolis (organism) [68507003] as the exact match. Parent taxa (e.g., family or class) would be overly broad, and child species are not mentioned. The colon label does not introduce attributes beyond taxonomy and thus the synonymic phrasing keeps the same concept and code."
860635002,No anemia present (situation),Absence of anemia,"The statement conveys the absence of the condition anemia. It maps to a Situation with explicit context, SCTID 860635002. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym for 'No anemia present' and does not introduce additional attributes. Parent concepts of general absence or sibling constructs involving evidence or testing are less exact, and disorder codes are inappropriate because the condition is explicitly negated."
150981000119101,Mumps vaccination given (situation),Immunization record: mumps vaccination given,"The entry indicates, via the record, that the mumps vaccination was given. The provenance does not alter the clinical concept; it still asserts the completed vaccination event. It fits the Situation category rather than a procedure, and is specific to mumps. It avoids mapping to parent concepts like “Immunization record reviewed” because the key assertion is the given vaccination, and avoids siblings involving other vaccine types."
449182000,Injection of air into peritoneal cavity (procedure),Report notes air injection into the peritoneal cavity,"This report-style entry states that air was injected into the peritoneal cavity, a Procedure. The exact SNOMED CT match is 449182000, reflecting air and peritoneal location. Broader parent procedures or siblings involving CO2 or other body cavities would be less accurate. The report context does not change the underlying procedure description."
449241006,Functional training in use of orthotic device (procedure),Training in use of orthotic device (functional),"This entry indicates training in using an orthotic device with explicit functional emphasis, matching the Procedure category and the concept “Functional training in use of orthotic device” (SCTID: 449241006). It avoids details such as device type, body site, timing, or outcome, preventing drift to any child concept. A generic training-in-device-use parent would be less specific, and siblings like “Education in orthotic use” or “Orthotic device fitting” are not as appropriate because the entry denotes hands-on functional training, not information-only education or fitting/adjustment services. The parenthetical “functional” reiterates the intended scope without adding new attributes."
255539006,Backward (qualifier value),Orientation: backward,"The concept recorded is an orientation described as “backward,” functioning as a directional qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, with the exact match being 255539006. Anatomical qualifiers such as “Posterior” are siblings with a different scope, and other directional qualifiers like “Forward” or “Downward” are incorrect. This phrasing conveys only the backward direction without added attributes."
411939006,Vespa crabro venom specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Prior testing included European hornet (Vespa crabro) venom diagnostic extract,"The entry documents that a diagnostic extract from European hornet (Vespa crabro) venom was used previously, identifying the product. This is a Product category allergen extract for diagnostic use, matching SCTID 411939006. The species and diagnostic purpose are explicit, ruling out parent generic venom extracts and sibling immunotherapy reagents. No extra attributes beyond product identity are present."
215437007,Submersion and drowning due to falling from burning ship (event),Drowned after falling from a burning ship,"This narrative describes the same event: drowning as the result of falling from a ship that was burning. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The synonym 'Drowned' is a clinically equivalent expression of 'drowning (event)' and does not change code selection; it conveys the same outcome. It remains a precise match to SCTID 215437007 because it retains the causal chain and the 'burning ship' context. Parent concepts lacking cause detail, or siblings like near drowning or fall from ship without burning, would be less appropriate."
223703001,Dominican Republic (geographic location),Country listed: Dominican Republic,"The core coded concept here is the country Dominican Republic; the contextual phrase 'Country listed' does not alter the location itself and introduces no clinical attributes. This maps to SNOMED CT 223703001 (geographic location). A broader parent such as Country (geographic location) would omit the specificity of which country, and child concepts like provinces are not indicated. The context does not change the code selection, which remains the sovereign nation."
472928008,Umbilical artery catheter tip submitted as specimen (specimen),UAC tip submitted as specimen,"The abbreviation UAC stands for umbilical artery catheter, and “tip submitted as specimen” clearly identifies the specimen type and submission status. Category: Specimen. This is equivalent to Umbilical artery catheter tip submitted as specimen (SCTID 472928008). Parent concepts that are generic catheter tips or device concepts are less specific, and siblings like umbilical venous catheter tips would not match the arterial designation. Using the abbreviation does not alter attributes; it is a clinically standard shorthand for the same concept."
729884002,Entire mesial incisal distal buccal tooth surfaces (body structure),Entire set of mesial incisal distal buccal tooth surfaces,"This entry denotes the complete set of mesial, incisal, distal, and buccal tooth surfaces, mapping precisely to SCTID 729884002 in the Body structure hierarchy. The term “set” indicates grouping and does not change the anatomical meaning. Parent concepts would be broader and less exact, while any sibling that modifies the surface combination would be incorrect. The completeness attribute (“entire”) is explicit, distinguishing it from non-entire structural references."
224071001,Montana (geographic location),Montana—geographic location,"The entry labels Montana as a geographic location, reinforcing the intended concept without adding clinical attributes. SNOMED CT category: Geographical location. This is a precise match to SCTID 224071001 and excludes parent (United States), sibling (other states), or child (Montana cities/counties) concepts. The descriptor is contextual and does not change code selection."
231716002,Insertion of corneal tension suture (procedure),Corneal tension suture placement procedure,"The wording identifies a procedure consisting of placement of a corneal tension suture. 'Placement' is clinically equivalent to 'insertion,' keeping the concept within the Procedure category and aligned with SCTID 231716002. The explicit tension type avoids broader suture insertion or different suture actions. No additional attributes are introduced that would shift to a parent, child, or sibling concept."
223651004,Greece (geographic location),Hellenic Republic,"Hellenic Republic is the official name of Greece and is a clinically safe, semantically equivalent synonym for the country. The main concept remains the geographic location of the sovereign state. In SNOMED CT, this is categorized under Environment or geographical location and maps to Greece (geographic location) SCTID 223651004. Parent regions like Europe are too broad, and children (e.g., specific Greek provinces) are too narrow. The synonym does not change code selection."
446769003,Occupational performance history interview score (observable entity),OPHI score,"This entry names the score associated with the Occupational Performance History Interview using the common abbreviation OPHI, without introducing any numeric value or qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and code 446769003 specifically denotes the OPHI score. Choosing a parent like 'functional assessment score' would be too generic, while coding the OPHI procedure would be incorrect because the text is the score, not the interview. The abbreviated synonym 'OPHI score' is clinically equivalent to 'Occupational performance history interview score' and does not change the intended concept."
49843003,Red-footed booby (organism),Red‑footed booby (organism),"The entry explicitly labels the taxonomic entity as an organism and names it Red-footed booby, i.e., Sula sula. No exposure or event information is included; the content is purely taxonomic identification. In SNOMED CT, this matches the Organism concept Red-footed booby (organism), SCTID 49843003. More general parents (Booby, Bird) or the genus Sula would be less precise, while other booby species would be incorrect. The parenthetical term clarifies category without changing the species-level semantics."
445024005,Removal of penetrating foreign body from eye using magnet (procedure),Operative note: magnetic extraction of penetrating ocular foreign body,"This operative note phrase indicates a performed procedure: extraction of a penetrating foreign body from the eye by magnetic means. Attributes: penetrating foreign body, ocular site, use of magnet. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 445024005 is the correct match because it describes removal from the eye of a penetrating foreign body using a magnet. Parent terms that are non-penetrating or non-magnetic are insufficient, and sibling procedures with other removal techniques don't align. 'Magnetic extraction' equals 'removal using a magnet' in clinical meaning."
218181009,Accident caused by electric wiring or appliance in public building (event),Patient report: accident caused by electrical wiring or appliance in a public building,"The patient-reported statement still centers on an accident event with cause (electrical wiring/appliance) and location (public building), mapping directly to SNOMED CT 218181009 under Event. The context marker ""Patient report"" does not introduce clinical findings or additional attributes. Using ""electrical"" is a synonymous variant of ""electric"". Codes limited to injuries (e.g., electric shock) or to accidents in other settings would be misapplied; the present concept is the most precise match."
118359005,Green laser light (physical force),Green laser illumination present,"The entry denotes the presence of green laser illumination, synonymous with green laser light. It contains no attributes about intent, intensity, or cause. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and SCTID 118359005 is the exact match. Parent categories like 'Laser light' lack the color detail; sibling color variants are not appropriate. The wording remains within a physical force and does not imply procedure or exposure concepts."
395977002,Fluocinolone (substance),Fluocinolone,"The entry names the specific pharmacologic substance fluocinolone without any formulation, strength, route, or derivative qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This maps precisely to Fluocinolone (substance), SCTID 395977002. Parent classes like corticosteroid or glucocorticoid would be too broad, and sibling concepts such as fluocinolone acetonide represent different chemical entities; no medicinal product or dosage form is specified, so product codes would be inappropriate."
224929004,Secure hospital (environment),Secure hospital environment,"This phrasing directly denotes the environment and mirrors the FSN semantics: a hospital setting that is secure. SNOMED category: Environment or geographical location. It most precisely matches SCTID 224929004 because the wording captures both the hospital context and the security characteristic. A parent concept like “Hospital (environment)” lacks the security qualifier, and child/sibling concepts that imply a specific unit or specialty are not indicated. The addition of ‘environment’ is a synonymous descriptor and does not change code selection."
443421000124100,Pediatric hydrolyzed protein formula (product),MAR entry: pediatric hydrolyzed protein formula,"Listed in the medication administration record context, the product named is pediatric hydrolyzed protein formula, which includes the pediatric designation and hydrolyzed protein attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This fits SCTID 443421000124100. Parent concepts lacking either component are too general, and child concepts adding extra specifics (degree of hydrolysis, indications, ingredient sources) would exceed the text. The MAR context does not change the product identity."
1304136001,Verification of identity completed (situation),Identity verification completed,"The main concept stated is that identity verification has been completed, with the explicit attribute of completion. This aligns exactly with the SNOMED CT situation concept 'Verification of identity completed', which represents the status that the identity-check activity has been concluded. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. A parent concept like a general identity verification process (procedure) would not capture the completion status, and siblings such as 'verification in progress' or 'verification not completed' would be incorrect. The wording uses the same terminology as the preferred term and does not add method, timing, or context beyond completion, so this is the most precise match."
1264214003,Family history of lipoprotein (a) hyperlipoproteinemia (situation),Family history significant for high lipoprotein(a).,"This indicates that the family history is significant for high lipoprotein(a), pointing to lipoprotein(a) hyperlipoproteinemia among relatives. The explicit familial context makes it a Situation with explicit context. SNOMED CT concept 1264214003 maps exactly. Broader parents (e.g., family history of lipid disorder) lack the necessary specificity, and siblings focused on other lipid entities are mismatched. 'High lipoprotein(a)' is a clinically safe synonym that maintains equivalence."
60977008,"Harrow, device (physical object)","Harrow, device","The entry exactly repeats the SNOMED CT preferred term, identifying the physical object 'harrow' as a device. No additional attributes such as type, cause, timing, or condition are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). SCTID 60977008 is the most precise match because it denotes the agricultural harrow as a device, whereas broader parents like generic 'Device' or 'Agricultural equipment' would be less specific, and children such as 'disc harrow' would be too narrow. The wording aligns perfectly with the concept name without altering meaning."
250467003,Determination of growth of fungi (procedure),Fungal growth determination (procedure),"This phrase is a direct procedural formulation of determining fungal growth. The concept entails assessing growth of fungi and introduces no extra attributes such as specimen, method, or results. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It maps precisely to SCTID 250467003. Parent concepts (e.g., determination of growth of organism) lack the fungal specificity, while siblings like bacterial or viral growth determinations are not applicable. Child concepts focused on culture would be over-specific since the entry does not specify culture as the method."
251661004,Luteal phase function (observable entity),Follow-up topic: luteal phase function,"As a follow-up topic, this entry still denotes the observable property of luteal phase function, without adding outcome or abnormality; it is an unqualified observation label. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The best code is 251661004, which specifically identifies luteal phase function. More general parents lack phase specificity, while disorder siblings introduce abnormal attributes, which are not present here. The contextual wording does not change the underlying observable concept."
119351004,Erythrocyte specimen (specimen),Specimen—red blood cells,"This documentation style cleanly identifies the specimen as red blood cells, synonymous with erythrocytes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, with Erythrocyte specimen (119351004) as the precise mapping. More general parent concepts or other cell-type siblings are inappropriate given the explicit identification of RBCs. No additional attributes are implied, so the specific erythrocyte specimen code is correct."
422035001,Oil of dill (product),Patient brought in a bottle of oil of dill,"Mention of a bottle the patient brought identifies a tangible product, aligning with Oil of dill (product) SCTID 422035001. Category: Product. The statement adds context but no clinical attributes such as dose or indication. Substance concepts are less suitable because the phrasing focuses on the packaged product rather than a raw ingredient."
462285004,"Peak flow meter, manual (physical object)",Non-electronic peak flow meter,"Non-electronic explicitly designates a manual or mechanical peak flow meter and identifies the device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This maps to Peak flow meter, manual (SCTID 462285004), since non-electronic is clinically equivalent to manual in this context. A generic peak flow meter would omit the modality, and an electronic meter would be a sibling concept. No extra attributes such as integrated recording or patient demographics are included, ensuring a precise code match."
258532001,Swab of inanimate object (specimen),Nonliving object swab,"The phrase identifies a swab whose source is a nonliving (inanimate) object, which matches the SNOMED CT concept Swab of inanimate object (specimen), SCTID 258532001. Category: Specimen. The use of 'nonliving' is a valid synonym for 'inanimate' and does not introduce additional attributes such as site or intent. It excludes specimens from living organisms and other collection methods, thereby not mapping to sibling concepts like body site swabs or to parents lacking the swab method. This makes 258532001 the precise choice."
441661000124107,Hydrolyzed peptide-based protein enteral formula (product),Peptide-based protein enteral formula,"This phrase denotes an enteral formula in which the protein is peptide-based, which in clinical usage implies a hydrolyzed protein source, aligning with Hydrolyzed peptide-based protein enteral formula. The main concept is a product for enteral nutrition with peptide-derived protein. SNOMED CT category: Product. It is more specific than the parent 'enteral formula' and narrower than generic 'protein enteral formula' by specifying peptide-based protein. It does not shift to siblings like amino acid–based formulas or intact protein formulas. The synonym 'peptide-based protein' is clinically equivalent to hydrolyzed peptide protein without introducing extra attributes."
1204490000,United States Minor Outlying Islands (geographic location),Patient-reported location: U.S. Minor Outlying Islands,"This is a patient-stated location value, with the actual coded concept being the geographic location U.S. Minor Outlying Islands. No additional clinical attributes are included. The SNOMED CT category is Location (Geographic location). The most accurate code is SCTID 1204490000. Parent concepts like the United States overall or child concepts naming particular islands do not match the exact phrasing, nor do sibling territories."
285061004,Military weapons installation (environment),Facility type: military weapons installation,"This identifies the facility type environment as a military weapons installation, which is equivalent to the given concept. Category: Environment. SCTID 285061004 fits because it denotes a weapons-centric military facility without specifying its particular role (e.g., storage, testing). Broader facility types (military base) are nonspecific, while narrower ones (ordnance depot, artillery range) are too specific. The label “Facility type:” is a documentation qualifier and does not change the intended environment coding."
735188002,Structure of right cavernous portion of internal carotid artery (body structure),Teaching note: the right ICA within the cavernous portion,"This states the right internal carotid artery specifically in its cavernous portion, with attributes of laterality (right) and segment (cavernous). It is a Body structure and matches SCTID 735188002. Broader parent concepts lacking laterality or entries referring to other segments would be less accurate, and left-sided structures are incorrect for this phrasing. The educational context does not introduce extra clinical attributes."
411710002,Lens esculenta diagnostic allergen extract (product),Using Lens esculenta diagnostic allergen extract in testing,"This statement references the product being used, identifying it explicitly as the Lens esculenta diagnostic allergen extract, which is a Product matching SCTID 411710002. While it mentions testing context, it does not specify method, route, or concentration, avoiding mapping to procedural concepts. Parent concepts without Lens esculenta are too broad, and therapeutic or non-lentil extracts are inappropriate siblings. The wording keeps the focus on the product identity for diagnostic use."
25841000181106,Nocardioides pacificus (organism),Nocardioides pacificus (organism),"This phrasing explicitly frames Nocardioides pacificus as an organism, aligning exactly with SNOMED CT 25841000181106. The main concept is the species-level organism; no clinical finding (e.g., detected, cultured) is asserted. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The parent genus Nocardioides would be too general, and any sibling species would be incorrect. The term does not introduce strain-level detail, so child concepts are not appropriate."
401931000,Blood glucose biosensor testing discs (physical object),Patient reports they need blood glucose biosensor testing discs,"The patient narrative indicates a need for the specific physical object: discs used with a biosensor for blood glucose testing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Mentioning need does not change the object being referenced; it remains more specific than generic biosensor discs and distinct from strips, lancets, or sensors. The wording does not add attributes beyond identifying the object, so 401931000 is the most accurate code."
789311000,Mirrored photographic image of teeth corrected flipped vertically (record artifact),Data quality note: mirrored dental photograph; top-bottom flip corrected.,"This data quality note identifies a mirrored dental photograph with a top-bottom flip corrected, and no other modifiers. It falls under the Record artifact category and corresponds exactly to SCTID 789311000. Parent/sibling concepts that lack either the mirrored aspect or the corrected vertical flip attribute would be less suitable. 'Top-bottom flip' is a synonymous expression for vertical flip."
1351857004,Meconin (substance),Meconin label text,"The wording indicates the label text reads “meconin,” which is a straightforward reference to the substance name without implying formulation, quantity, or product composition. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, with Meconin (substance), SCTID 1351857004, as the exact match. Parent chemical concepts are less specific, and sibling entities such as meconic acid or meconium would not fit. Labeling context does not introduce attributes that change the coded concept."
262401005,Hardjo (qualifier value),Hardjo (no additional attributes),"This explicitly states that the entry comprises only the qualifier value Hardjo, without additional clinical details. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and the exact code is Hardjo (262401005). Parent general qualifiers would be overly broad, and organism or disease concepts do not apply given the absence of any organism or pathology in the wording."
168539009,Plain X-ray requested (situation),Plain X-ray has been requested.,"The statement confirms a request for a plain X-ray exists, indicating intent without performance and without specifying site or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This is a direct restatement of the preferred term with identical meaning. Mapping to a broader “radiography requested” parent would lose the ‘plain’ specificity, and child/sibling concepts with site, contrast, or completion would be inappropriate. SCTID 168539009 is the exact match."
789108009,Measured quantity of intake of protein and/or protein derivative via enteral route in 24 hours (observable entity),Measured intake of protein via enteral route per 24 hours,"This formulation denotes a measured intake quantity of protein via the enteral route per 24 hours. The attributes are clear: protein, enteral, 24-hour timeframe, and measured quantity, defining an Observable entity. It matches SCTID 789108009 precisely. Parent concepts omitting nutrient specificity would be overly broad, and siblings for other nutrient types are inappropriate. No additional attributes (e.g., route subtypes or numeric values) are introduced, preserving alignment with the given concept."
216941008,"Failure of sterile precautions during aspiration of fluid or tissue, puncture and catheterization (event)",Documented sterile procedure precautions failure during aspiration/puncture/catheterization.,"The core concept is failure of sterile procedure precautions, explicitly linked to aspiration, puncture, or catheterization contexts. This is an Event and maps to SCTID 216941008. The procedural scope included in the wording provides the necessary specificity over a generic parent concept, and because no single procedure is isolated, child concepts limited to one category are less appropriate. The phrasing is a safe paraphrase that maintains semantic equivalence."
223504005,South America (geographic location),Recorded location: South America,This entry records the location as South America. Main concept: South America as a geographic location/continent. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 223504005 is the precise code for South America. Parent concepts are too broad; child concepts within South America and sibling continents would misrepresent the entry. The term 'Recorded' provides documentation context only and does not change or add to the location concept.
414988007,Pacing beats/minute (qualifier value),Unit: pacing beats per minute,"Labeling “Unit: pacing beats per minute” clearly identifies a unit designation for pacing rate. This is a Qualifier value and matches 414988007. No measurement or configuration detail is provided, so observables or device-programming concepts are not implicated. Including “pacing” ensures this does not map to the broader parent “beats/minute” unit."
365567004,Legal history finding relating to appointment of power of attorney (finding),Power-of-attorney paperwork on file indicating an appointment.,"This entry notes documentation confirming that a POA appointment has been made, focusing on the appointment rather than mere document presence. The main concept is a legal history finding relating to POA appointment, with no extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps best to 365567004 because the wording 'indicating an appointment' aligns with the appointment event; a code for 'legal document present' alone would be too general, and healthcare proxy or living will would not match. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent to appointment of POA."
763760008,Medicinal product categorized by structure (product),Patient portal label: medication categorized by structure,"Despite a patient-facing context, the statement refers to medications being categorized by structure, aligning with 'Medicinal product categorized by structure'. The main concept is product categorization based on structure; there are no added attributes such as therapy, dose form, or strength. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This is the best match because the axis of categorization is structural. Parent concepts are too broad, and sibling concepts representing other categorization bases are not indicated. Child concepts are avoided by not naming specific structural classes."
1287688003,Downburst (event),Documented downburst,"The entry indicates that a downburst has been documented, keeping the focus solely on the downburst event. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Event, matching Downburst (event), SCTID 1287688003. The documentation context does not add timing, severity, or subtype details, so neither parents (generic severe weather) nor siblings (e.g., tornado) nor children (microburst) are more suitable. The wording preserves the same clinical concept without modification."
404432003,"Salmonella II, group O:42 (organism)",Note: Salmonella II; O-group 42,"Despite punctuation variation, the entry clearly denotes Salmonella II and O-group 42, which together specify the organism concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It maps uniquely to SCTID 404432003. Parent or sibling concepts would omit or alter either component, and child concepts would introduce serovar/strain attributes. 'O-group 42' is a synonym of 'group O:42' without changing the code."
706957005,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, healthcare facility (environment)",History: place of accident/poisoning—healthcare facility,"In a history note, the place of the accident or poisoning is recorded as a healthcare facility. The concept captured is the environmental place-of-occurrence attribute. The SNOMED CT category is Environment, and 706957005 is the best match as it precisely denotes 'healthcare facility' for place of occurrence. A general parent concept would omit the location, and specifying hospital/clinic would be a child with extra granularity not present here. The phrasing uses an equivalent synonym without altering the code."
223967007,Regions of Wales (geographic location),Imaging report location: Welsh regions,The phrase introduces an imaging report context but the coded content remains the geographic concept “Welsh regions.” No procedural attributes are being coded; only the location set is referenced. In SNOMED CT this maps to the Geographic location concept 223967007 (Regions of Wales). It avoids the parent country concept and refrains from naming any specific child region. “Welsh regions” is a safe synonym of the preferred term and does not alter the code selection.
288570008,General practice waiting room (environment),In the general practice waiting room,"This entry indicates presence in the general practice waiting room, identifying the environment. It fits the SNOMED CT Environment concept 'General practice waiting room (environment)' SCTID 288570008. No extra attributes like time, severity, or associated events are specified. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., hospital or ED waiting rooms) would not match as precisely."
1155884006,Presence of direct invasion by primary malignant neoplasm of nasal sinus to nerve (observable entity),Direct invasion into nerve present due to primary nasal sinus malignancy.,"The statement documents presence of direct invasion into a nerve attributable to a primary malignancy of the nasal sinus. Key components: presence, direct invasion, primary malignant neoplasm of nasal sinus, nerve. This matches the Observable entity 1155884006. Referring to the causative tumor is integral to the concept and does not introduce new attributes beyond what the concept defines. No perineural spread or alternative targets are mentioned, avoiding sibling concepts; no nerve type is specified, avoiding child concepts."
73803009,Glaucarubin (substance),Glaucarubin chemical,"The phrase uses a clinically acceptable synonym, describing Glaucarubin as a ‘chemical,’ which remains semantically equivalent to a named substance. The main concept is the chemical entity Glaucarubin. In SNOMED CT, this is best coded as Glaucarubin (substance), SCTID 73803009. No attributes such as dose, route, or therapeutic intent are introduced; thus, drug product concepts or findings are not indicated. Broader parent categories like ‘Chemical (substance)’ are less specific, and different compounds would be incorrect. The synonym does not change the code selection because it still denotes the same molecule."
467143001,"X-ray system tube support, ceiling mount (physical object)",Ceiling-suspended X-ray tube support,"The concept described is an X-ray tube support that is suspended from the ceiling, which is a common synonym for ceiling mount. This is a Physical object. “Ceiling-suspended” is clinically equivalent to “ceiling-mounted” in this context and does not add new attributes, so SCTID 467143001 is the best fit. More general parents omit the mounting detail, and siblings such as floor-mounted or wall-mounted supports are incompatible with the ceiling suspension wording."
405608006,Academic medical center (environment),Place of service: academic medical center,"The phrase indicates the place of service as an academic medical center. Category: Environment. The most accurate SNOMED CT mapping is 405608006 since it specifies the environment clearly without implying organizational or procedural constructs. More general environments (e.g., hospital) or organizational entities would be less precise. The wording adds no cause, severity, timing, or associated conditions."
328705009,Gluten-free spaghetti (product),Uses gluten-free spaghetti,"While 'uses' implies utilization, the core concept being referenced is the specific product gluten-free spaghetti. This fits the Product category and maps directly to SCTID 328705009. It is not a diet order or a consumption event code; the item itself is the target concept. It avoids introducing attributes such as brand, ingredients beyond gluten-free, or preparation."
223895008,Nottinghamshire (geographic location),Nottinghamshire county,"This entry names the county-level geographic unit explicitly as “Nottinghamshire county,” which is a semantically equivalent way to refer to the same place. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value — Geographic location. SCTID 223895008 is the exact county-level concept. Using the descriptor “county” does not change the concept or imply a different code; it avoids mapping to siblings (e.g., Nottingham city) or parents (e.g., England). No extra attributes are included."
224288002,Duration of formal education (observable entity),Length of formal education,"The phrase focuses on the length—i.e., duration—of formal education as an observable. It does not introduce values, levels, degrees, or timing beyond the intrinsic duration concept. Consequently, SCTID 224288002 is the precise code. More general duration concepts would be less specific, and sibling concepts like educational attainment or level of education do not measure time, making them less appropriate."
67810001,Salmonella Lika (organism),Microbe name: Salmonella Lika,"This entry provides a naming context and specifies the microbe Salmonella Lika. The main concept is the organism entity. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 67810001 is most precise. Parent or generic microbe concepts would be less specific, and sibling/child concepts involving other serovars or findings are not indicated."
467511007,Callous file (physical object),Callus file (physical object),"This uses the synonym 'callus' while explicitly stating the category, ensuring a direct match to the physical object concept. No extra attributes are added. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 467511007 is the specific code. Generic parents ('File' or 'Device') are less precise, and siblings (e.g., 'Pumice stone') represent different tools."
277979008,Between 18-27 degrees C (qualifier value),18–27 degrees centigrade,"The phrase uses 'degrees centigrade', an accepted synonym for degrees Celsius, paired with the numeric interval 18–27, clearly indicating the Celsius temperature range. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, and 277979008 specifically covers this range. Parent qualifiers for temperature or unit-only concepts (e.g., Celsius without bounds) are less exact, while siblings or children differ in numeric limits or unit. 'Centigrade' is clinically equivalent to 'Celsius' and does not alter the code selection."
416657008,Intraoperative record (record artifact),Operating room intraoperative record,"This entry explicitly anchors the document to the operating room context, which is naturally implied by 'intraoperative.' It describes a document artifact, not a clinical event. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the precise code is 416657008 (Intraoperative record). Using a broader parent would lose specificity, while children/siblings such as nursing- or anesthesia-specific records would be overly narrow and not mentioned. The added phrase 'operating room' does not introduce a different document type and remains within the intraoperative record concept."
364709006,Hematology observable (observable entity),Hematology lab parameter (observable),"The entry describes a hematology-domain parameter as an observable, without specifying which parameter or providing a result. It fits the Observable entity category and maps to Hematology observable (observable entity), SCTID 364709006. Parent concepts like Laboratory parameter (observable) would be too broad, while children (e.g., mean corpuscular volume) would be too specific. 'Parameter' is commonly used to denote an observable variable and is clinically equivalent here, preserving code selection."
371537001,Consent report (record artifact),Consent report included with referral,"This entry indicates that a consent report accompanies a referral, highlighting the artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 371537001 is appropriate because it specifies a report of consent. A generic 'report' parent would lose specificity, and sibling artifacts like a consent form or note are not mentioned. Inclusion with referral is administrative context and does not alter the artifact type or introduce extra attributes."
428667005,History of reduction of breast (situation),PSH: breast reduction,"Listing breast reduction under PSH (past surgical history) denotes a prior procedure and thus a historical situation. The best SNOMED CT match is 'History of reduction of breast (situation)', a Situation with explicit context. 'Reduction mammoplasty (procedure)' would miscode the historical nature as current procedure, and 'History of breast surgery' is too broad. The entry includes no extra qualifiers such as timing or laterality."
34012005,Product containing sulfonylurea (product),Home medication: sulfonylurea-containing medicine,"This indicates a home medication that is a medicine containing sulfonylurea, with no dosing or formulation details. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 34012005 is appropriate as it represents products with sulfonylurea content. Substance-level mapping would ignore the product context, and child codes for specific agents/formulations would be over-specified. 'Medicine' as a synonym preserves the concept of a product."
735133001,Cethexonium (substance),Cethexonium — cataloged as a substance,"The entry labels cethexonium explicitly as a substance, with no mention of salt forms, dosing, administration, brand, or clinical context. This fits the SNOMED CT category Substance, matching Cethexonium (substance) SCTID 735133001. A parent Substance concept would be too broad, and sibling product concepts would be incorrect due to the absence of product formulation or use. The descriptive phrase confirms substance identity without adding attributes, supporting the precise code."
411263006,Sorbitan monooleate (product),Sorbitan monooleate single-ingredient product,"The phrase emphasizes that the product contains only sorbitan monooleate, which is consistent with the generic product concept and does not introduce dose form, strength, route, or indication. This maps to Sorbitan monooleate (product), SCTID 411263006 within the Product hierarchy. Parent concepts are too broad and child concepts specifying formulation or additional components are not intended. The term remains clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
411977000,Recombinant bone morphogenic protein graft (product),Recombinant bone morphogenic protein graft,"This entry uses the variant spelling “morphogenic” for bone morphogenetic protein, a clinically accepted synonym referencing the same BMP entity. It clearly denotes a graft product and thus maps to the SNOMED CT Product concept. Parent classes like general bone grafts or protein products are less precise, and isoform-specific children (e.g., BMP-2, BMP-7) are not indicated. No extra attributes (site, timing, severity, brand) are introduced, so 411977000 is the most precise code."
251484000,Focal electroencephalogram pattern (observable entity),Focal pattern noted on EEG,"The wording documents the presence of a focal pattern on EEG, an observation about the recorded electrical activity configuration. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This maps to 251484000 Focal electroencephalogram pattern, as it captures focality without additional attributes like laterality, abnormality, or particular waveform types. Using a broader parent concept (EEG pattern) would omit the focal attribute, and more specific child concepts (e.g., focal spikes, focal slowing) would be over-specified relative to the text."
250233006,Red blood cell inclusions (finding),Inclusion bodies in red blood cells,"The phrase denotes inclusion bodies located within red blood cells, capturing the same morphological presence finding as the concept Red blood cell inclusions. This maps to SNOMED CT 250233006 (Clinical finding). It avoids naming a specific inclusion type or cause, so child concepts are not indicated. Broader concepts of RBC morphology abnormalities are less precise, and siblings such as malaria parasitemia or nucleated RBCs describe different phenomena. 'Inclusion bodies' is a direct synonym for cellular inclusions and maintains equivalence."
714483002,Structure of orbital region (body structure),Structure of orbital region,"This is the preferred term and directly denotes the anatomical structure corresponding to SCTID 714483002. The main concept is the orbital region anatomy; no timing, laterality, or clinical findings are introduced. Category: Body structure. Using a broader region (e.g., facial region) would be less specific, while choosing a narrower structure such as the bony orbit or periorbital soft tissues would misrepresent the requested general region. Therefore, the exact concept and code are the correct match."
411600004,Horse serum proteins diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy testing extract: horse serum proteins (diagnostic),"The entry indicates a product used for allergy testing and specifies that the allergenic source is horse serum proteins, confirming a diagnostic allergen extract and mapping to SNOMED CT product 411600004. Category: Product. The explicit diagnostic use and serum protein source make it more specific than generic horse allergen extracts and distinct from other horse-related allergens like dander. The parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate due to missing the serum protein qualifier or having different uses, while this entry adds no extraneous attributes."
117203004,Ganglioside asialo-GM1 antibody (substance),Asialo-GM1 ganglioside antibody,"This variant places the ganglioside name before “antibody,” but still denotes the specific antibody to asialo-GM1, matching the Substance concept Ganglioside asialo-GM1 antibody (SCTID: 117203004). The entry lacks attributes related to test procedures, positivity, or isotype classification, so finding or procedure codes are inappropriate. A parent antibody concept would be nonspecific, and sibling ganglioside targets are different. The wording is a semantically equivalent synonym for the same substance."
215602004,"Submersion or drowning due to being thrown overboard, occupant of small unpowered boat injured (event)",Injury event: thrown overboard from a small unpowered boat resulting in water submersion/drowning.,"This records an injury event where the subject was thrown overboard from a small unpowered boat and experienced submersion/drowning. It aligns with SNOMED CT Event SCTID 215602004 by including the mechanism (overboard throw), the hazardous exposure (submersion/drowning), and the context (small unpowered boat occupant). It avoids attributes like intent, timing, or specific lesions. More general drowning codes omit the boat context, and sibling concepts for falls or powered craft would be inaccurate here. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term."
397981001,Invasiveness (qualifier value),Test invasiveness,"The phrase refers to the invasiveness property in the context of a diagnostic test, but does not specify the degree. This matches SNOMED CT 397981001 Invasiveness (qualifier value), a Qualifier value used to characterize tests or procedures by their invasiveness. Child values such as “non-invasive” or “minimally invasive” would be too specific and are not stated. It is not asserting a test type or a result, so sibling or parent concepts in Procedure or Observable hierarchies are inappropriate. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent to the qualifier name."
697971008,Arteriovenous fistula route (qualifier value),Administration through AV fistula (route),"The entry describes administration through an AV fistula and clarifies it is a route. This is a Qualifier value and matches SNOMED CT 697971008 exactly. Parent route concepts are too general, while sibling concepts implying grafts or catheters are excluded by the explicit use of 'fistula.'"
78949001,Viscosity (observable entity),Report references viscosity,"The entry indicates that a report mentions the property 'viscosity' but provides no further attributes such as values, interpretations, or materials. The main concept is viscosity as an Observable entity. SCTID 78949001 is the precise code, since the property itself is identified rather than a test or a result state. Parent concepts are too nonspecific, and child/sibling concepts like 'Blood viscosity' or 'Kinematic viscosity' add details not present. The reference maintains focus on the property, ensuring correct mapping."
223840002,Islands of Netherlands (geographic location),Exposure location: Dutch isles,"Despite the exposure context, the coded value is the location 'Dutch isles', a synonym for the islands of the Netherlands. Category: Location — Geographic location. SCTID 223840002 best fits because the entry references the collective islands without specifying subsets like Wadden or Caribbean regions. Parents (Netherlands) would include non-islands; children/siblings would over-specify beyond the wording used."
846617008,Firebrush pollen (substance),Firebrush floral pollen,"This entry specifies the pollen from the flower of the firebrush, which is a clinically safe paraphrase of 'firebrush pollen'. It fits the SNOMED CT Substance concept Firebrush pollen (846617008). No new attributes such as testing outcomes or extract status are introduced. Parent concepts (e.g., generic pollen) are too broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., firebrush organism or extract) do not match because the entry focuses on the pollen material itself."
386679005,Air and space transport accident (event),Patient reports an air or space transport accident,"Although framed as a patient-reported statement, the concept itself is the event: an accident involving air or space transport. No cause, severity, or other qualifiers are added. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The inclusive 'air or space' wording supports 386679005 rather than a more general accident or a single-mode child concept."
242564005,Accident due to exposure to excessive humidity (event),Accident due to very high humidity exposure,"This entry clearly indicates an accident and specifies the cause as exposure to very high humidity, which is a synonym for excessive humidity. The main concept is an accident event; the attribute is environmental exposure to excessive humidity. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 242564005 is the most accurate code because it encodes accidents due to excessive humidity exposure. Parent concepts such as generic ‘Accident’ or ‘Environmental exposure’ are too broad, and sibling accidents due to other environmental extremes are not applicable. The phrase ‘very high humidity’ does not introduce extra attributes and remains equivalent to ‘excessive humidity.’"
444453009,Exposure to varicella (event),Exposed to chickenpox,"This entry captures the event of being exposed to chickenpox (varicella) without indicating illness or other attributes. It falls under the SNOMED CT category Event and maps directly to Exposure to varicella (event), SCTID 444453009. It is more specific than generic exposure concepts and does not drift into diagnosis ('Varicella (disorder)') or pathogen exposure (VZV), making parent, child, or sibling concepts less appropriate."
217445003,Hit by object falling from burning dormitory of educational institution (event),Struck by object falling from a dormitory of an educational institution that was on fire,"This phrasing captures being struck by a falling object from a dormitory of an educational institution that was on fire (burning), which is exactly SCTID 217445003. The SNOMED CT category is Event. Broader parents would miss either the dormitory or burning qualifiers, and siblings like non-burning dormitory events or other building types would not fit. “On fire” is a direct synonym for “burning,” leaving the code selection unchanged."
69250004,Rhodotorula glutinis (organism),Identified species: Rhodotorula glutinis,"This line conveys that the species identified is Rhodotorula glutinis, which references the organism without specifying clinical context such as site or infection. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, matched precisely by Rhodotorula glutinis (organism), SCTID 69250004. A parent genus code would be less specific, and a sibling species code would be incorrect. The phrase 'identified species' is a neutral descriptor and does not convert the concept into a clinical finding."
463330007,Orthopedic bone distractor (physical object),Ortho device: bone distractor,"This entry labels the item as an orthopedic device and names it a bone distractor, which is a Physical object. No additional attributes are present, so site-specific children or broader generic distractor concepts are not suggested. The phrasing is a documentation variant that is clinically equivalent to 'orthopedic bone distractor', warranting SCTID 463330007."
735984001,Heart failure self management plan (record artifact),Care team notes a heart failure self-management plan,"This entry indicates that clinicians documented the presence of a heart failure self-management plan, clearly describing a record artifact. The category is Record artifact, and SCTID 735984001 fits exactly. The phrasing does not add attributes beyond existence in documentation. Parent concepts are overly broad, and sibling concepts such as heart failure care plan lack the explicit patient self-management emphasis."
1344925005,"Digital imaging phosphor plate, dental, extraoral (physical object)",Extraoral dental computed radiography (CR) plate,"CR plate is a widely used synonym for storage phosphor/PSP plates, and the entry specifies dental and extraoral use, pointing to the precise object. The main concept is the extraoral dental CR imaging plate as a physical object. SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The exact match is Digital imaging phosphor plate, dental, extraoral (1344925005). A parent concept like dental CR plate without extraoral or a sibling intraoral CR plate would be less precise given the explicit extraoral qualifier."
1162482008,Sotorasib (substance),Formulary substance: sotorasib,"The entry presents sotorasib as a formulary substance, which still refers to the ingredient rather than a specific product presentation. SNOMED CT category: Substance. The best match is Sotorasib (substance), SCTID 1162482008. Product concepts require dose form or brand details not present here, and class concepts would be less specific than naming the particular substance."
277100007,Orthodontic lock pin (physical object),Dental orthodontic lock pin,"Main concept: an orthodontic lock pin in the dental context; adding “dental” does not change the device identity. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The qualifier clarifies clinical domain without introducing broader device categories or other components. Sibling concepts like archwire or bracket are not referenced, and no procedural or condition details are added. Therefore, 277100007 (Orthodontic lock pin) is the precise code."
440819005,Sporomusa termitida (organism),Exact species: Sporomusa termitida,"The entry asserts the exact species name Sporomusa termitida, indicating species-level specificity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This corresponds to SCTID 440819005 precisely, without adding any clinical or detection attributes. Broader concepts (genus Sporomusa) would be imprecise, while strain-level children or sibling species would be incorrect. The phrasing is a synonym that retains the same organism code."
105341002,Timolol measurement (procedure),Timolol drug level measurement,"This indicates measurement of the drug level for timolol, clearly a Procedure. The inclusion of “drug level” clarifies the substance is a medication, consistent with timolol measurement. No added attributes (specimen, method, timing) are present, making 105341002 the most specific code over generic drug level measurement or specimen-specific variants."
216312009,Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning (environment),Site of accident or poisoning (place of occurrence),"The phrase identifies an environmental site and restates that it is the place of occurrence, maintaining the accident-or-poisoning context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It matches SCTID 216312009 because the entry focuses on the place element of an accident or poisoning without narrowing to a specific venue. Using “site” as a synonym for place does not introduce any additional attributes or constrain the location, avoiding child or sibling concepts."
1279895006,Surgical margin involved by carcinoma in situ in excised specimen of small intestine (observable entity),Small intestinal surgical margin involved by in situ carcinoma in the excised specimen.,"The entry uses ‘in situ carcinoma’ as a synonym for carcinoma in situ and identifies the surgical margin of an excised small intestine specimen as involved, an observable result. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 1279895006 precisely captures this situation. Parent concepts missing organ specification or sibling concepts for invasive carcinoma do not align with the wording. The synonym ‘in situ carcinoma’ is clinically equivalent to CIS and maintains the intended code."
201000221105,Antigen of inactivated whole Rabies lyssavirus (substance),"Rabies lyssavirus whole‑virus antigen, inactivated",The entry emphasizes that the antigen is Rabies lyssavirus in whole‑virus form and is inactivated. The main concept is the antigen substance; SNOMED CT category is Substance. This exact combination corresponds to the specified concept and avoids mapping to broader categories or different antigen types. The phrasing is a safe synonym with no added clinical attributes.
767314005,Product manufactured as cutaneous dose form (product),Medication list entry: product manufactured as cutaneous dose form,"Within a medication list, this item is still a product whose dosage form is cutaneous. The main concept is a product categorized by dose form. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 767314005 matches because it denotes manufactured products in a cutaneous dose form broadly. It does not imply any specific skin formulation (cream, ointment, gel), preventing more specific child codes, and it excludes non-cutaneous siblings. The list context does not introduce new clinical attributes."
257604003,Enclosed harbor (environment),Context listed: enclosed harbor,"The core concept is an enclosed harbor serving as the contextual environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. SCTID 257604003 applies because the term includes the defining enclosure attribute. A broader harbor concept would be insufficiently specific, and siblings like open harbor would contradict the wording. The word 'context' is a documentation frame and does not change the environmental concept."
467033002,Ultrasonic dental scaling system (physical object),Ultrasonic dental scaler system,"The term ‘scaler system’ in a dental context with ‘ultrasonic’ specifies the full equipment set intended for ultrasonic scaling. SNOMED category: Physical object (device). This aligns exactly to Ultrasonic dental scaling system 467033002. It is not a procedure, nor a single instrument component; siblings like sonic scaler systems are excluded by the ultrasonic qualifier."
717342009,Aspiration of upper limb using cone beam computed tomography guidance (procedure),"CBCT-guided aspiration, upper limb region","The phrase indicates aspiration guided by CBCT in the upper limb region, which is a Procedure. It maps to SCTID 717342009 because both the anatomical scope (upper limb) and the guidance modality (CBCT) are specified. Choosing a parent without CBCT or a site-unspecified CBCT-guided aspiration would reduce precision, while specifying a particular joint or structure would create an overly narrow child. 'Region' does not add new attributes beyond the intended upper limb site."
103393003,Protein bound (qualifier value),Observed as protein-bound,"The entry states an observation that the item is protein-bound, which conveys the binding-state qualifier and nothing else. It fits the Qualifier value category, mapped to 103393003 Protein bound. A parent concept like 'bound' or a sibling like 'free' would not reflect the explicit 'protein' aspect of the binding. This paraphrase is equivalent to 'protein-bound' and does not alter the code choice."
226053006,Rose wine (substance),Rosé wine documented,"This entry identifies the substance rosé wine and notes that it is documented, which is contextual but does not add clinical attributes. It fits the SNOMED CT Substance category and maps precisely to SCTID 226053006 Rose wine (substance). Parent concepts like Wine (substance) are too broad, and sibling wine types are excluded by the rosé specification. The term remains uniquely codable to the rose wine substance without introducing new modifiers."
309977007,Restorative dentistry department (environment),Care setting: restorative dentistry department,"The phrase identifies the care setting as a restorative dentistry department, which is an environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It is best coded to SCTID 309977007 since it names a department in restorative dentistry. It does not suggest a clinic, unit, or inpatient ward, avoiding sibling concepts. A generic Dental department parent would be less precise. No timing, severity, or reason attributes are present; the focus remains the environment."
309227001,Sigmoid colonic polyp specimen (specimen),Received: sigmoid colon polyp specimen,"This is a received specimen originating from a sigmoid colon polyp, in the Specimen category. It specifies the source lesion and anatomical site without additional attributes. That precision aligns with SCTID 309227001. More general parent concepts would omit either the polyp or site detail, and more specific children would add histology or method. The received status is workflow context and does not alter coding."
1208371000,Svalbard and Jan Mayen (geographic location),Service location: Svalbard and Jan Mayen,"The entry specifies the geographic place “Svalbard and Jan Mayen” as the value for a service location field. The concept is a Geographic location under the Location hierarchy. The wording aligns directly with SCTID 1208371000. Using a parent is less precise, while selecting child locations like only Svalbard would be inaccurate because the combined term is explicitly stated. The contextual phrase does not introduce new attributes to the location itself."
285657009,Mechanical torsion (physical force),Twisting mechanical force (torsion),"The entry employs “twisting mechanical force” and labels it as torsion, which is the precise phenomenon of rotational twist about an axis. This falls under Physical force (Event) and maps directly to SNOMED CT 285657009. No extra attributes are included. A parent concept of physical force lacks specificity, and siblings like shear or compression do not match the twisting characteristic. “Twisting” is a standard clinical paraphrase for torsion and does not change the code selection."
223972003,Gwynedd (geographic location),County of Gwynedd,"This entry names the place as 'County of Gwynedd', which remains a geographic location and matches SNOMED CT 223972003. The wording does not imply residency, travel, or other attributes; it solely identifies the place. It does not shift to an organizational concept (e.g., council) and avoids broader or narrower areas. The SNOMED category is Geographic location within Location. Using 'county' is a descriptive synonym indicating the type of geographic entity without altering the core concept."
165414004,Hematocrit below reference range (finding),Assessment: low hematocrit,"The assessment notes hematocrit is low, indicating a value under the reference range, with no additional qualifiers. This constitutes a Clinical finding and should be coded to SNOMED CT 165414004 Hematocrit below reference range (finding). Abnormal hematocrit as a parent lacks directionality, and increased hematocrit is inconsistent. Anemia as a disorder is not directly stated and would be inappropriate. The simple descriptor “low” conveys below-reference status without altering the concept."
308375000,Report for Procurator-Fiscal (record artifact),Report for the Procurator Fiscal—recipient Procurator Fiscal,"This entry reiterates the report’s recipient as the Procurator Fiscal, which directly matches SNOMED CT 308375000 (Record artifact). The phrasing does not add content, type, or purpose attributes beyond the intended recipient. Parent report artifacts would be too general, and siblings like “Report for coroner” are excluded. The synonym is clinically and administratively equivalent to the preferred term, preserving precise code selection."
714704005,Hypopharyngeal fistula occluder (physical object),Occluder—hypopharyngeal fistula,"This compact label names an occluder and specifies it is for a hypopharyngeal fistula, with no procedural or status information. The main concept is a physical device that occludes a fistula of the hypopharynx. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). It maps to SCTID 714704005 due to clear function and anatomical specificity; generic occluders or occluders for different sites would be less appropriate. The punctuation does not alter the concept selection."
299516004,Foot joint crepitus audible (finding),Audible grating sound from foot joint.,"The phrase describes an audible grating sound consistent with crepitus and confines the location to a foot joint. This is a Clinical finding and fits SNOMED CT 299516004, which is specific to audible crepitus of foot joints. Broader parent concepts do not indicate the foot location, and siblings indicating other modalities (e.g., palpable) or other joints (e.g., ankle) are not supported by the wording. 'Grating sound' is a clinically equivalent descriptor of crepitus and maintains code appropriateness."
360415004,Structure of primitive cerebral artery (body structure),Primitive cerebral artery mentioned in history,"Even within a history context, the entry solely identifies the primitive cerebral artery as an anatomical structure. It maps to the Body structure category, with SCTID 360415004 as the correct and most specific code. Using a parent concept would be too general, while choosing a sibling (e.g., primitive trigeminal artery) would misrepresent the vessel. The wording does not add attributes beyond naming the structure, so the selection remains precise."
9952003,Salmonella Tanger (organism),Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Tanger,"This is a fully expanded taxonomic synonym that specifies species, subspecies (enterica), and serovar (Tanger), which is the same organism concept as Salmonella Tanger. The main concept is the microorganism, categorized in SNOMED CT as Organism. The inclusion of subspecies is part of standard taxonomy and does not add clinical attributes. Parent concepts like Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica are broader, and other serovars are siblings and would not match. This wording is the most precise for the named serovar."
411686007,Alces species meat diagnostic allergen extract (product),Moose meat diagnostic allergen extract,"This entry uses the common name 'moose' to denote Alces species and specifies 'meat' as the source material and 'diagnostic allergen extract' as the product type, which aligns exactly with SCTID 411686007. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Parent concepts such as generic diagnostic allergen extracts, and sibling concepts like other species' meat extracts or non-meat Alces extracts, would be less precise. 'Moose' is a clinically equivalent synonym for Alces in this context and does not change code selection."
700704009,Radiation therapy beam block transporter (physical object),Beam block transport device used in radiation therapy,"The entry conveys a device that transports beam blocks in the radiotherapy setting. Category: Physical object. The synonym “transport device” is clinically equivalent to “transporter,” capturing the same object. Parent device categories would be too unspecific; siblings such as block trays or loaders represent different functionality. The statement does not add details like timing or materials, so it uniquely maps to 700704009."
440655000,Outpatient environment (environment),Report context: outpatient setting,"In a documentation/report header, this denotes that the context is an outpatient setting without adding details about the test or procedure itself. Main concept: outpatient environment. Category: Environment. SCTID 440655000 is the best fit as the term pertains to setting alone. Parent environments are too broad, and siblings such as inpatient or ED environments or procedure encounters would not match the context-only wording."
890442004,X-ray capsule endoluminal scanning system (physical object),Endoluminal X-ray capsule scanning system,"This phrase denotes a device that is endoluminal, uses X-ray, and is a capsule-based scanning system. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The reordering of terms is a clinically equivalent synonym for the FSN and maintains the same device attributes, matching SCTID 890442004. It is more specific than a parent concept such as endoluminal scanning systems without modality, and does not imply a procedure or a different modality, avoiding sibling or child misclassification."
16847901000119102,History of primary transitional cell carcinoma of right kidney (situation),History shows primary TCC of the right kidney,"The entry uses “history shows” to denote a past condition, with “TCC” as a standard abbreviation for transitional cell carcinoma, and clearly states right kidney for site and laterality. This is a Situation with explicit context. It is not a current disorder entry and does not include extra attributes like stage or treatment. Parent concepts without histology and sibling concepts with different laterality are less accurate, making the history of primary transitional cell carcinoma of right kidney the appropriate code."
42107008,Human leukocyte antigen Cw (substance),HLA Cw antigen,"The spacing variant 'HLA Cw antigen' is a clinically equivalent synonym for the HLA-Cw antigen as a substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. No detail about serotype number, reactivity, or test outcome is present. Therefore, Human leukocyte antigen Cw (substance) SCTID 42107008 is the exact match. Parent concepts are overly broad, and child concepts like specific Cw alleles/serotypes are not invoked. Antibody or typing-result concepts are not implied."
63433007,"Cerebrospinal fluid formation, function (observable entity)",CSF production function,"Here, 'production' is used as a clinically accepted synonym for 'formation' of cerebrospinal fluid, still referring to the function itself as an observable parameter. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 63433007 is the precise fit, as it covers the function tied to CSF formation/production. More general or different sibling concepts (e.g., CSF flow or absorption) are excluded by the wording, and no rate or abnormality is implied, so rate-specific or finding codes are not appropriate."
422095003,Subclass Rosidae (organism),Rosidae — taxonomic subclass,The dash-separated presentation still conveys Rosidae as a taxonomic subclass. The main concept is an Organism taxon. The precise SNOMED CT code is Subclass Rosidae (organism); a parent would be too broad and children like specific orders or families are too narrow. The synonym phrasing does not add clinical or temporal attributes.
249278006,Ability to pass urine (observable entity),Capacity to void,"Using ‘void’ for urinate, ‘capacity to void’ denotes the same observable. It belongs to the Observable entity category and is best represented by 249278006. The entry does not introduce presence, absence, severity, cause, or timing, ensuring it does not map to findings such as urinary retention or inability to void, nor to broader functional observables."
730921005,Entire C5/C6 interspinous ligament (body structure),Anatomical focus: interspinous ligament at C5–C6,"This entry names the anatomical focus as the interspinous ligament located at C5–C6, defining a single, complete ligament at that level. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. Entire C5/C6 interspinous ligament (730921005) is the precise match given the explicit level. Parent structures without level specification are too general, and sibling concepts at other cervical levels do not match. The contextual phrase “anatomical focus” does not add clinical attributes and keeps the meaning equivalent to the entire structure."
102328007,"Sword, device (physical object)",Listed device—sword,"This entry indicates the sword is listed as a device, which preserves the core identity of the physical object without adding attributes such as intent or subtype. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device); the exact match is 102328007 “Sword, device (physical object).” The documentation context (“listed”) does not shift the concept to a parent, sibling, or child. No features like material or usage are introduced, so the code remains the precise sword device."
103760009,Specimen mass measurement (procedure),Specimen weight measurement,"This phrase conveys the procedure of measuring the specimen’s weight, which is clinically equivalent to mass measurement in healthcare documentation. The main concept is the measurement of specimen weight; no attributes like timing, specimen type, or values are included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 103760009 is appropriate because SNOMED treats weight measurement as mass measurement for clinical use. A generic parent like specimen measurement would be too broad, and siblings like specimen volume measurement or count are inaccurate. It does not denote an observable result; it denotes the action of measurement."
413177005,Alpha-adrenoceptor blocker not tolerated (situation),History notes indicate alpha-adrenergic blocker not tolerated,"This is a history note context stating that alpha-adrenergic blockers are not tolerated, using an equivalent synonym for alpha-adrenoceptor blockers. No timing beyond being part of history is specified, and no causes or agents are named. It fits the Situation with explicit context category and matches SCTID 413177005. It does not map better to 'history of' a different SNOMED concept because the core situation being recorded is the intolerance itself. The synonym maintains the same class and code."
184247006,Kick chart (record artifact),Kick chart record,"“Record” signals the chart as a recorded artifact while preserving the specific type (kick chart). The main concept remains an artifact, not a procedure or finding. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Kick chart (184247006) is the most specific code for this artifact. Using broader parent concepts like “Record artifact” would lose specificity, and siblings like “Growth chart” are inappropriate. No extra clinical attributes are introduced; it remains the same chart."
309944008,Obstetrics department (environment),Department of Obstetrics,"This phrase is a straightforward reordering that still denotes the same healthcare environment—a department dedicated to obstetrics. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. It aligns precisely with 309944008 (Obstetrics department (environment)). Parent concepts (e.g., Hospital department) would be too generic, while siblings (e.g., Obstetrics and gynecology department, Maternity ward) introduce scope differences that are not stated here. The synonym is clinically equivalent, representing the same department setting without implying clinic, ward, or unit."
733482006,Second void urine specimen (specimen),Source: second void urine,"This entry records the specimen source as second void urine, denoting the collection subtype. The primary concept is the specimen; the stated attribute is second void. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Code 733482006 is the exact match, whereas a parent urine specimen is non-specific and siblings like first void or midstream introduce different collection methods. 'Source' phrasing is a common lab documentation style and maintains semantic equivalence."
439693004,Genus Thermoplasma (organism),Taxonomic genus Thermoplasma,"The wording indicates the taxonomic rank 'genus' and the name 'Thermoplasma', which aligns with the Organism concept Genus Thermoplasma (organism), SCTID 439693004. It does not specify species-level detail or broader archaeal categories, making parent concepts too general and child concepts too specific. The term is a clear synonym emphasizing taxonomy without adding attributes like clinical status or location, thus preserving the correct coding granularity."
224777007,Physical environment (environment),Physical environment in history,"This indicates the physical environment was a topic within the history; the main concept remains the physical environment. Category: Environment. It maps to Physical environment (environment) 224777007. Choosing a parent Environment would lose the physical specificity, and any child specifying a particular setting would be unsupported."
773436007,Plastic surgery care plan (record artifact),Plastic surgery care plan document,"Labeling it a 'document' explicitly conveys that this is a recorded plan artifact within the plastic surgery domain. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The precise code is Plastic surgery care plan (record artifact) [773436007]. A parent concept like a generic care plan would lose the specialty specificity, and sibling concepts such as operative plans or consent forms are not referenced. The term 'document' confirms the record artifact and adds no clinical qualifiers."
361616000,Structure of fifth posterior intercostal artery (body structure),"Posterior intercostal artery, fifth","Reordered phrasing still unambiguously identifies the fifth posterior intercostal artery as the concept. This is a SNOMED CT Body structure and matches Structure of fifth posterior intercostal artery (361616000). A parent term like posterior intercostal artery lacks the specified ordinal, while child terms with laterality or pathology are not supported by this wording. The comma placement does not add attributes; it simply clarifies the ordinal, keeping the code selection unchanged."
285336007,Background radiation (physical force),Background radiation cited in diagnostic report,"The main concept is background radiation, cited within a diagnostic report. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. No measurement, exposure, or causation attributes are present, keeping the scope to the ambient phenomenon. Consequently, SCTID 285336007 is the most precise code, and alternatives like general radiation or exposure-related codes would be less appropriate."
265597008,Implantation of bulbar urethral prosthesis for incontinence (procedure),Prosthetic device implanted at bulbar urethra for incontinence,"The main concept is placement of a prosthetic device in the bulbar urethra with the indication of incontinence. This is a Procedure. The phrase “prosthetic device” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “prosthesis,” and specifying “bulbar urethra” and “for incontinence” matches the concept exactly. SCTID 265597008 is the most precise code because it includes both the anatomical location and the indication. Parent concepts without the site, or child/sibling concepts that specify a particular device (e.g., artificial urinary sphincter) are not indicated by the wording."
269682006,Fire on powered aircraft while in flight (event),Patient statement: “There was a fire on the powered aircraft while we were in flight.”,"This patient-reported wording clearly describes a fire event on a powered aircraft during flight. It maps to the Event category. The phrasing is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and avoids additional attributes. Therefore, SCTID 269682006 is the most accurate code; using parent or child concepts would either omit key attributes (powered, in-flight) or add specificity (engine/cabin) not present."
286617004,Zinc intake (observable entity),Zinc intake considered during counseling,"The phrase indicates that zinc intake—the observable—was considered, but it does not introduce measurement results, severity, or timing. It belongs to Observable entity and should be coded as Zinc intake (286617004). The counseling context does not change the target concept; it avoids mapping to education or therapy codes. It is not a sibling like copper intake nor a different category such as laboratory findings."
272776001,LI19 (body structure),Acupuncture point LI19,"This wording identifies LI19 specifically as an acupuncture point, which is recognized in SNOMED CT as a body structure. It introduces no procedure or clinical finding, keeping the concept purely anatomical. The exact match is LI19 (body structure); generic parents such as “Acupuncture point of the Large Intestine meridian” are too broad, and siblings like LI18 or LI20 refer to different sites. The phrase is a direct synonym of LI19 and does not add or change attributes, ensuring precise coding."
285677002,Mechanical impact (physical force),Encountered mechanical impact,"This narrative implies the presence of mechanical impact as the relevant physical force, without detailing injuries, causes, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It maps to SCTID 285677002, which defines mechanical impact. Mapping to broader Physical force would be nonspecific, and selecting specific types like blunt or penetrating would be unwarranted. The verb 'encountered' provides context but does not change the concept."
286141002,Able to clean cooker (finding),Able to clean cooking stove,"Main concept: ability to clean the cooking stove, a synonymous term for cooker/range. There are no added attributes such as independence level, timing, or degree. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. This matches 286141002 Able to clean cooker (finding). Broader functional ability concepts would not capture the task specificity; sibling tasks addressing different appliances are incorrect. ""Cooking stove"" is an acceptable synonym and does not change code selection."
223966003,Skye (geographic location),Skye (Hebridean island),"This entry identifies Skye and clarifies it as a Hebridean island, which is a descriptive but non-relational qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location hierarchy). The correct mapping is Skye (geographic location), SCTID 223966003. Coding to the Hebrides generally would be too broad, while selecting another island or a sublocation on Skye would not match. The qualifier does not alter the concept and supports precise coding."
439720003,Has never shared drug injection equipment (situation),Chart note: has never shared syringes.,"The chart note records a lifetime negation of syringe sharing, which falls within drug injection equipment sharing. This is a Situation. The term 'syringes' is a standard synonym subset and does not change the coded concept. Broader or time-limited siblings are excluded by the explicit 'has never' wording, making the target concept the exact match."
88644004,Tornado (event),Tornado mentioned in discharge summary,"This entry reports a tornado within a discharge summary, yet it presents no attributes beyond the event itself. The correct SNOMED CT classification is Tornado (event), SCTID 88644004 in the Event hierarchy. Broader parent terms (Storm) would be less specific, and sibling events (Hurricane, Cyclone, Waterspout) are different phenomena. The documentation context (discharge summary) does not change the underlying event being a tornado."
32462006,Product containing melanocyte stimulating hormone releasing factor (product),MRH (melanotropin-releasing hormone) medication product,"This describes a medication product containing MRH (melanotropin-releasing hormone), which is synonymous with MSH releasing factor. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The product context and specified active match SCTID 32462006. Parents like generic product are too broad, and siblings referencing MSH itself, analogs, or formulations would be inaccurate. The abbreviation and expanded synonym are clinically equivalent and do not add attributes."
736055001,Rehabilitation care plan (record artifact),Rehab care plan,"This entry uses the common abbreviation 'rehab' to denote rehabilitation, paired with 'care plan,' indicating a documented plan of care. It corresponds to Rehabilitation care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736055001, a Record artifact. The abbreviation does not alter meaning and remains clinically equivalent to 'rehabilitation.' More general parent concepts like Care plan (record artifact) lack the rehabilitation specificity, and child or sibling concepts specifying particular therapy modalities or services would add attributes not present here. The phrasing stays focused on the plan artifact."
1290503000,Smoke alarm (physical object),Fire safety device—smoke alarm,"The context 'fire safety device' appropriately situates the physical object and the specific noun 'smoke alarm' defines it precisely. Category: Physical object. It maps to Smoke alarm (physical object), SCTID 1290503000, rather than to broader 'fire alarm' (sibling) or an alarm system (parent). No subtype or functional variant is specified, keeping the code choice exact."
86644006,Nursing diagnosis (finding),Nursing diagnosis indicated.,"The phrase reports that a nursing diagnosis is indicated, meaning present, without adding certainty, risk, or temporal qualifiers. The concept is a nursing diagnosis (Clinical finding). SNOMED CT 86644006 fits best. A generic diagnosis code would lack nursing specificity, and more specific nursing diagnosis subclasses or qualifiers (risk/actual) are not mentioned, so child or sibling concepts would not be correct."
285096004,Waterfall (environment),Waterfall (environment),"This phrasing explicitly identifies the concept as an environmental location and directly matches SNOMED CT Waterfall (environment) [285096004]. No extra attributes are introduced; it does not describe any incident, exposure severity, time, or associated condition. Parent categories (e.g., natural environment or water feature) are too general, and sibling features like river or stream are incorrect. The entry’s explicit environmental qualifier ensures unambiguous alignment to the Environment or geographical location class."
44742001,Hemoglobin Louisville (substance),Louisville Hgb,"This entry employs the Hgb abbreviation with Louisville, indicating the specific hemoglobin variant as a Substance. SNOMED CT code 44742001 is the precise match. The text does not assert presence, heterozygosity, or clinical effect, preventing misclassification to disorder or observation concepts. Parent or sibling hemoglobin variant codes are less appropriate because the Louisville variant is explicitly named."
396999004,Specimen from bone marrow obtained by biopsy (specimen),Bone marrow biopsy specimen,"The entry names a physical specimen sourced from bone marrow and explicitly indicates acquisition by biopsy. The main concepts are the specimen itself, the anatomical source (bone marrow), and the method (biopsy). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This matches SCTID 396999004 precisely because it specifies bone marrow and the biopsy technique, distinguishing it from the broader parent concept of a bone marrow specimen without method and from sibling concepts like bone marrow aspirate specimens. The wording avoids procedure framing and therefore does not map to the procedure concept."
327298003,Product containing hormone receptor antagonist (product),Medication name—hormone receptor antagonist,"The entry conveys a medication named by its pharmacologic class, hormone receptor antagonist, which aligns with SNOMED CT 327298003 in the Product hierarchy. The documentation context (“Medication name”) does not add clinical attributes such as receptor subtype, dose form, route, brand, strength, timing, or indication, so it does not necessitate a more specific child concept or a procedural code. It remains a product classification statement, making this code the most precise and appropriate match."
6425004,Product containing histamine receptor antagonist (product),Histamine receptor antagonist—medication item,"The entry denotes a medication item that is a histamine receptor antagonist-containing product. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It maps precisely to SCTID 6425004 because it isolates the product concept and does not specify subtype (H1/H2), molecule, dose, or intended use. Parent product concepts are too general, and child/sibling concepts such as class-specific antagonists or named drugs would overconstrain the meaning. The hyphenated phrasing does not introduce additional attributes; it maintains equivalence to the preferred term."
13825000,Entire vagus nerve parasympathetic fibers to pulmonary plexus (body structure),Neuroanatomy: vagus parasympathetic fibers to pulmonary plexus,"Within a neuroanatomy context, the concept remains the same: the vagus nerve's parasympathetic fibers directed to the pulmonary plexus. This anatomical entity is best coded as SCTID 13825000 in the Body structure hierarchy. The entry contains no additional qualifiers such as laterality, functional status, or pathology, thus implying the entire structure. Parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling concepts (e.g., pulmonary plexus or pulmonary branches) are not the same. The wording is an equivalent paraphrase."
213816009,Train collision with platform (event),Collision of train with platform.,"The wording identifies the collision and specifies the participants: train and platform. This fits the Event category and corresponds exactly to Train collision with platform (event), SCTID 213816009. A parent like rail transport accident would be too broad, and siblings involving collisions with other specific objects (e.g., buffer stop, vehicle) are not described here. The phrase is a synonymous paraphrase of the preferred term without any modifiers that would change mapping."
464309008,"Assistive automobile driving/engine control component, manual (physical object)",Evaluated manual assistive driving/engine control component on patient’s automobile,"This documentation asserts evaluation of a manual assistive driving/engine control component on the patient’s automobile, mapping to SNOMED CT 464309008 under Physical object. Attributes: manual modality, assistive purpose, automobile domain, and driving/engine control scope. The evaluation context does not shift the focus away from the object. No specific sub-control is mentioned, preventing child mappings, and there is no powered/electronic aspect, avoiding siblings. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
736901002,Thoracic trocar blade (physical object),Trocar blade—thoracic,"This phrasing denotes a trocar blade with thoracic specification, clearly pointing to the blade component used for thoracic access. The main concept remains a Physical object: thoracic trocar blade. It is the best match because it combines the device type (trocar blade) with the thoracic qualifier. Using just “Trocar blade” would be overly general (parent concept), while “Thoracic trocar” (entire device) or “Thoracic obturator/cannula” would misidentify the component. The em dash and word order do not alter the clinical meaning."
421268003,Non-tidal river (environment),Patient states: was at a non-tidal river,"This patient-reported statement specifies the environment as a non-tidal river, with no extra attributes beyond the non-tidal qualifier. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to Environment or geographical location and maps directly to Non-tidal river (environment), SCTID 421268003. Choosing the parent River (environment) would lose the essential non-tidal detail, while Tidal river (environment) would be contradictory. The contextual phrasing 'Patient states' frames the narrative but does not affect the concept selection."
422534007,Rafert-Long projection (qualifier value),Rafert-Long X-ray view,The phrase 'X-ray view' is a clinically standard synonym for 'radiographic projection' and does not introduce additional attributes beyond the technique name. The concept is a Qualifier value. It maps precisely to SCTID 422534007 because it denotes the specific eponymous projection. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too broad ('X-ray projection') or describe different named views. The wording does not add site or other qualifiers.
785315000,Product containing silicon and/or silicon compound (product),Product is labeled as containing silicon compound,"Labeling indicating a silicon compound aligns with the ‘and/or silicon compound’ wording. The main concept is a product with a silicon-based compound present. Category: Product. The entry does not specify which compound, preventing misclassification to children like silica or silicate-containing products. It does not mention silicone. The phrase remains equivalent to the preferred concept."
213922004,"Fall on train, pedal cyclist injured (event)",Onboard train fall with pedal cyclist injured.,"“Onboard train” is synonymous with “on train,” and the entry states that a pedal cyclist was injured in that fall, defining the same external cause event. This maps to SNOMED CT Event 213922004. Choosing a parent such as “onboard transport fall” or a sibling involving another vehicle or user category would be less specific. The synonym does not add attributes or change the code."
7532001,Structure of vagus nerve parasympathetic fibers (body structure),Cranial nerve X parasympathetic fibers,"The entry specifies cranial nerve X (vagus nerve) and its parasympathetic fibers, clearly indicating an anatomical structure. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This aligns precisely with SCTID 7532001 because it denotes the specific fiber type within CN X. A parent concept such as 'cranial nerve X structure' is too general and a sibling concept describing other CN X fiber modalities would not fit. 'Cranial nerve X' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'vagus nerve' and does not change the code selection."
399689008,Specimen from thyroid obtained by thyroidectomy (specimen),Specimen received: thyroidectomy—thyroid gland,"This phrasing denotes that the specimen received is the thyroid gland from a thyroidectomy, explicitly stating source (thyroid gland) and procurement method (thyroidectomy). It aligns with the Specimen category concept for specimen from thyroid obtained by thyroidectomy. General thyroid specimens lacking method or specimens obtained by biopsy would be less appropriate codes. The wording is equivalent to the preferred term and avoids adding attributes such as laterality or disease context."
59338009,Methapyrilene (substance),Active ingredient: methapyrilene,"This entry identifies methapyrilene as the active ingredient, which is a common contextual label but still denotes the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the specific code 59338009 best fits the named chemical without implying a product, dose, route, or salt form. Using a product concept or an observable entity would be less appropriate because no formulation, measurement, or clinical event is described."
124745005,Chvostek sign positive (situation),Documentation: Chvostek sign recorded as positive.,"The entry notes that documentation records the Chvostek sign as positive, conveying a clear positive result without additional qualifiers. The main concept is the positive status of the specific sign. The SNOMED CT category is Situation because it represents the result of an exam. SCTID 124745005 is the exact match, encoding this positivity. Alternatives like 'Chvostek sign' (finding) would be less specific, and 'negative' or unspecified siblings would not fit. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not alter the code."
170640003,No peak flow meter at home (situation),No peak flow meter at home.,"The entry states the absence of a peak flow meter in the home environment, which directly matches the situation of lack of a specific device at home. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This wording precisely aligns with “No peak flow meter at home” and does not add any attributes such as cause, timing, or associated conditions. Broader parent concepts like general lack of equipment at home would be less specific, and sibling concepts like absence of other respiratory devices would be incorrect."
82371002,Proton beam (physical force),Proton beam identified in the record,"The identification pertains to the concept of a proton beam; it does not introduce therapy, exposure, dose, device, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, best represented by Proton beam (physical force), SCTID 82371002. Parent concepts (charged particle beam) are not as specific, and sibling beam types differ. No procedural context is implied, so procedure codes are inappropriate."
429219001,History of repair of mitral valve (situation),Follow-up note: status post mitral valve repair,"This follow-up note uses 'status post' to indicate a previously completed mitral valve repair, clearly situating the concept as a past event rather than the procedure itself. The main concept is the historical status of mitral valve repair. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 429219001 is the exact match for a history of repair of the mitral valve; procedure codes or general history codes would be less precise. Sibling concepts involving replacement or other valve repairs are not applicable here since the wording specifies repair of the mitral valve."
218206009,Overexposure to soft X-rays (event),Exposure incident—soft X-ray overexposure,"The main concept is an overexposure to soft X-rays, framed as an exposure incident. The term 'incident' provides documentation context without altering the clinical meaning or adding attributes such as severity or intent. This is an Event. SNOMED CT 218206009 Overexposure to soft X-rays (event) is the precise match. Parent or sibling concepts that generalize radiation type or add context (e.g., occupational) are not indicated by the wording."
242100008,Accident due to motor vehicle on road failing to negotiate curve (event),"EMS note: motor vehicle road accident, failure to negotiate curve","The EMS documentation identifies a motor vehicle road accident with the specific mechanism of failing to negotiate a curve. Attributes present are motor vehicle, on-road setting, and curve negotiation failure causing the accident. As an Event, the correct SNOMED CT code is 242100008, which is specific to this mechanism on a road. More general motor vehicle accident codes are insufficiently specific, and siblings like off-road incidents or collisions with other vehicles are not indicated. The EMS context does not alter the concept; the phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
216405001,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, nightclub (environment)",Discharge summary confirms place of occurrence (accident/poisoning) as nightclub,"The discharge summary provides the place-of-occurrence attribute and specifies 'nightclub,' mapping directly to SNOMED CT 216405001. Category: Environment. The word 'confirms' does not change the coded concept; it remains the location of accident/poisoning. Parent or sibling environment concepts would be less appropriate given the explicit nightclub reference."
161890006,No backache (situation),Backache: none,"A concise problem-list style entry indicating that backache is not present. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, matching No backache (situation). Coding to Backache (finding) would be incorrect because the statement is negative. No additional qualifiers (e.g., location, timing, severity) are included, making this entry uniquely codable to 161890006 rather than to broader or more specific sibling concepts."
161774001,History of contraceptive cap usage (situation),Past use of contraceptive cap,"The phrase “Past use” unambiguously sets the historical context and identifies the device as a contraceptive cap. The main concept is prior usage. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 161774001 is the exact match, as it encodes the situation of past contraceptive cap use. More general parent concepts (e.g., history of contraception) are less precise, and siblings referring to different devices are irrelevant. No additional qualifiers are present."
110941003,Epididymis cytologic material (specimen),Collected: epididymal cytology material,"This collection note indicates cytology material was obtained from the epididymis, specifying both the source and specimen type. In SNOMED CT, this is a Specimen and the exact code is 110941003. Using a parent specimen concept would omit the cytologic attribute, while siblings implying tissue histology or collection technique (e.g., aspirate) are not present. The phrase is a clinically equivalent synonym for the preferred term."
4537002,Structure of internal medullary lamina of thalamus (body structure),Patient statement: “internal medullary lamina of the thalamus”,"The patient-reported context quotes only the anatomical term without any additional descriptors, still identifying the internal medullary lamina of the thalamus. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It corresponds to SCTID 4537002. There is no implication of condition, laterality, or other attributes, and it does not broaden to parent or shift to sibling structures. Quotation does not change the coded concept."
261019009,Modulated (qualifier value),"""Modulated"" documented","This entry indicates that the term 'modulated' was documented, without specifying any additional characteristics. The core coded content remains the qualifier value Modulated (261019009) in the Qualifier value category. Because it does not mention type of modulation or a related procedure, parent, child, or sibling concepts (e.g., intensity-modulated procedures) are less appropriate. The documentation framing does not change the underlying qualifier value."
105799003,Household device (physical object),Device intended for household use,"This entry describes the same concept through intended use, which is a standard way to identify the household device class. Category: Physical object. It matches SNOMED 105799003 and avoids implying any specific device subtype. Parent device categories are too general, and child concepts would require naming a specific household device."
1287443009,Ultrashort wave radiation (physical force),Ultrashort wave radiation (physical force),"This entry echoes the fully specified name style by explicitly noting the semantic tag, making it a direct representation of the Physical force concept. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Ultrashort wave radiation (physical force) [1287443009]. Mapping to Electromagnetic radiation would be too broad, and to siblings like Microwave radiation or Short wave radiation would incorrectly place the spectral range. The wording is an exact synonym of the intended concept and appropriately selects the specific code."
371920000,Two standard deviations above mean (qualifier value),Patient states: two standard deviations above mean,"In a patient-reported context, the essential qualifier remains 'two standard deviations above mean,' specifying magnitude and positive direction. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, with code 371920000 as the exact match. Parent qualifiers lack the numeric specificity, and siblings differ by SD count or direction. The patient narrative framing does not add clinical attributes or change code selection."
224837006,Fast food shop (environment),Restaurant (fast food),"This phrasing specifies a restaurant of the fast-food type, synonymous with fast food shop, focusing on the environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. The most accurate code is 224837006 Fast food shop (environment), not the broader parent restaurant (environment), due to the fast-food qualifier. It does not suggest any child or sibling environments (e.g., drive-through only, cafe). No other attributes are implied."
448971002,Roflumilast (substance),Roflumilast as the active,"This indicates roflumilast in the role of active ingredient, which still refers to the substance itself and avoids dose, route, or product specification. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. SCTID 448971002 is the most accurate code; concepts like roflumilast-containing medicinal product or therapy are not supported by the wording."
1362039001,Spaeth gonioscopy grading system (staging scale),Spaeth angle staging scale for gonioscopy,"This phrase emphasizes the staging nature of the Spaeth system and its application to gonioscopic angle assessment. The SNOMED CT category is Assessment scale/staging scale. It matches SCTID 1362039001 as it refers to the named scale entity, not to a measurement outcome or the gonioscopy procedure. No patient attributes are included. Other angle staging systems (e.g., Shaffer) are less appropriate because this explicitly cites Spaeth."
230111009,Chinese food intake (observable entity),Chinese food intake,"The main concept expressed is the observation that Chinese food is consumed. No amount, frequency, timing, or associated conditions are specified. This aligns with SNOMED CT category Observable entity and maps most precisely to Chinese food intake (SCTID: 230111009). Broader parent concepts like food intake or Asian food intake are less specific, and child or sibling concepts (e.g., Japanese food intake) are not indicated. The wording mirrors the preferred term and does not introduce any additional attributes."
364520008,Feature of foot joint (observable entity),Follow-up note: foot joint feature,"This entry keeps the content as a foot joint feature; the ‘Follow-up note’ context does not add time, severity, or type details to the observable itself. Category: Observable entity. It maps to 364520008 because it identifies a generic observable feature of the foot joint site. Using a broader parent would lose specificity, while more specific foot sub-joint features would add detail not present. The contextual label does not change the code selection."
110933003,Prostate cytologic material (specimen),Source material: prostate cytology specimen,"The entry labels the source material as a prostate cytology specimen, i.e., cytologic material from the prostate. The main concept is a specimen with explicit site and cytologic type. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 110933003 is the most precise match; parents like Cytology specimen lack site, while children with collection methods are too specific. “Cytology specimen” is synonymous with cytologic material and maintains the same code selection."
223888004,Leicestershire (geographic location),"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",The entry presents Leicestershire with the national context 'United Kingdom' and adds no extra attributes. The main concept is Leicestershire; SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The code 223888004 maps precisely to Leicestershire (geographic location). Parent concepts like United Kingdom are too general; child/sibling locations like specific districts are too narrow. The addition of the country is a synonym-level clarification that does not affect code choice.
736453000,Laryngectomy surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient care plan specific to laryngectomy surgery,"This entry clearly denotes an inpatient care plan that is specific to laryngectomy surgery, identifying a documented care plan artifact. Category: Record artifact. The exact SNOMED CT match is “Laryngectomy surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact)” SCTID 736453000. The wording confines the plan to the inpatient context and the laryngectomy surgery domain. Parent categories like general inpatient care plans or general surgical care plans are too broad; sibling concepts such as outpatient plans or pathways are not suggested, so this code is the best fit."
370563004,Territorial aggression (finding),Territorial aggression observed by clinician,"This records clinician-observed territorial aggression, retaining the same Clinical finding. It maps to SNOMED CT 370563004 because the aggression is explicitly territorial. General aggressive behavior (parent) is too broad, and other specific aggression types are not supported by the wording. Observation context does not introduce additional attributes such as severity or timing."
304596000,Entire subcutaneous tissue of thoracic segment of trunk (body structure),Subcutaneous tissue—thoracic portion of trunk,"The entry names the subcutaneous tissue layer located within the thoracic portion of the trunk. This is a Body structure, with no severity, laterality, or pathological details included. It is neither broader than the thoracic segment nor narrower via subregion restriction. Sibling concepts for other trunk segments are excluded. SCTID 304596000 fits best."
735985000,Diabetes self management plan (record artifact),Clinical summary includes a diabetes self-management plan,"This phrasing indicates that a documented diabetes self-management plan is part of the clinical summary, highlighting the artifact’s inclusion. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It fits Diabetes self management plan (record artifact) SCTID 735985000, describing a patient-directed plan recorded in documentation. It avoids implying provider-directed care planning or procedures and does not introduce type, severity, or temporal attributes, so broader or adjacent concepts are less precise."
278740008,Transileal approach (qualifier value),Access route: through ileum,"The phrase describes the access route as through the ileum, which is synonymous with a transileal approach. No information about the procedure itself or other attributes is given. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The specific mention of 'ileum' makes Transileal approach (278740008) the most exact match. A parent concept like a generic transintestinal route would be overly broad, and a sibling approach via jejunum or duodenum would not match the stated bowel segment. 'Through ileum' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of 'transileal'."
262507007,Endolaser (physical force),Use of endolaser,"This documentation statement indicates use of the endolaser energy modality without specifying any site, timing, or treatment details. The main concept is the physical force endolaser; SNOMED CT category Physical force, mapped to Endolaser (physical force), SCTID 262507007. It should not be coded as a procedure because no action or target is described, and a generic laser parent would be less specific than the explicit endolaser subtype."
285073004,Archery range (environment),Reported location: archery range,"This entry records a reported location and specifies 'archery range,' focusing exclusively on the environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It matches SCTID 285073004 exactly, not broader environments such as sports fields or parks. The administrative framing 'reported location' does not alter the environmental nature or add clinical attributes."
251894003,Exertion rating (staging scale),Perceived exertion rating scale (staging),"This wording indicates a staging-type instrument for perceived exertion without specifying a brand or a result. The main concept is the scale itself; attributes are limited to its purpose (exertion) and type (staging/rating). In SNOMED CT, 251894003 maps to Exertion rating (staging scale), which is the most precise match. A parent like Staging scale is too general, and siblings such as pain or dyspnea scales are unrelated. Naming perceived exertion preserves clinical equivalence to exertion rating and does not introduce extra detail."
314435009,Preference for male healthcare professional (finding),Prefers male healthcare professional,"The entry explicitly documents a patient preference for the sex of the healthcare professional, specifically male, without introducing any other attributes such as specialty, setting, reason, or timing. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT and maps directly to 314435009 Preference for male healthcare professional (finding). More general parent concepts like Patient preference (finding) or Preference for healthcare professional (finding) are too broad and do not capture the male attribute, while sibling concepts such as Preference for female healthcare professional are incorrect. The phrasing uses a standard synonym for healthcare professional and remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
70477002,"Treatment of nasomaxillary complex fracture, Lefort II type (procedure)",Clinical documentation: treatment of Le Fort II type fracture,"The entry is a documentation-style statement of procedural treatment targeted at a Le Fort II fracture. Category: Procedure. It maps to 70477002 by naming the treatment and the specific Le Fort II classification without specifying operative method or other attributes. Parents like 'clinical management of facial fracture' lack the classification detail, and children such as specific reduction techniques go beyond the scope. The phrase is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term, maintaining precision."
129706002,At increased risk for disorganized infant behavior (finding),Clinician impression: increased risk for disorganized infant behavior,"The clinician impression documents increased risk for disorganized infant behavior and does not include causation, severity beyond “increased,” or additional modifiers. This is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 129706002 is the precise match, as it represents the specific increased-risk status for disorganized infant behavior. Coding to a diagnosis of disorganized behavior or to a general risk concept would be less accurate."
36998008,Glycogen (substance),Glycogen (biochemical compound),"The wording identifies glycogen as a biochemical compound, which remains within the scope of Substance. SCTID 36998008 best represents glycogen specifically. Choosing a parent like biochemical compound (generic) or carbohydrate (substance) would be insufficiently precise, and sibling substances (e.g., dextran, cellulose) differ structurally and functionally. The entry avoids attributes such as measurement, site, timing, or associated conditions, ensuring accurate mapping to the glycogen substance."
309938009,Nuclear medicine department (environment),In the nuclear medicine department,"The phrase conveys being physically located inside the nuclear medicine department. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This maps accurately to SCTID 309938009 by specifying the exact departmental environment. Alternatives like “Radiology department” or “Imaging suite” are incorrect siblings; “Hospital department” as a parent is not specific enough. No procedures, timing, or severity attributes are introduced; the wording is an equivalent expression of the same place."
700934005,Wearable sweat-induction iontophoresis device/chloride analyzer (physical object),Wearable iontophoresis sweat chloride analyzer device,"This phrasing conveys a wearable device that uses iontophoresis to induce sweat and performs chloride analysis on that sweat, preserving both critical functions. The explicit attributes are wearable, iontophoresis for sweat induction, and chloride analysis, identifying a Physical object. The synonym sequence and word order do not change meaning: “iontophoresis sweat chloride analyzer device” is clinically equivalent to the preferred term’s combined device/analyzer description. A parent like a general analyzer or iontophoresis equipment would omit the integrated dual purpose, and a sibling like a non-wearable analyzer would not match the wearable attribute. Therefore, the concept matches precisely without drifting to parent, child, or sibling codes."
698944006,History of closure of ventricular septal defect (situation),Echocardiography report impression: status post VSD closure,"In an imaging report context, 'status post VSD closure' communicates a prior closure of the ventricular septal defect and serves as historical clinical context rather than a current finding of a defect. The main concept is a past VSD closure; this is a Situation category entry. The most precise match is 'History of closure of ventricular septal defect (situation)'. Using a procedure code would be inappropriate, and choosing a broader history parent or anatomy-mismatched sibling would be less accurate. The phrasing does not specify method or timing, so technique-specific children are not warranted."
706910009,Ceriporia lacerata (organism),"Ceriporia lacerata, species-level designation","The phrase identifies Ceriporia lacerata as a species-level designation, emphasizing the exact organism name. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This aligns with 706910009 Ceriporia lacerata (organism). Broader parent concepts like Ceriporia (genus) or Fungus (organism) do not capture the species specificity, and alternative Ceriporia species would be sibling concepts. No clinical attributes (e.g., infection, presence, or site) are conveyed, keeping the mapping directly to the organism concept."
422300007,Suborder Rhynchophthirina (organism),Taxonomic suborder: Rhynchophthirina,"The entry names the taxonomic suborder Rhynchophthirina and nothing else, indicating an organism classification. In SNOMED CT, this is correctly coded under Organism as SCTID 422300007. Broader parents (order) or different siblings (other lice suborders) do not match the stated suborder, and any specific species would be child concepts, which are not referenced here. No presence, infection, or other clinical attributes are introduced, preserving the pure organism concept."
443302001,Bifidobacterium longum subspecies longum (organism),Genus Bifidobacterium; species longum; subspecies longum,The entry provides the full taxonomic hierarchy culminating in subspecies longum under species longum within genus Bifidobacterium. The main concept is the precise organism taxon Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 443302001 is appropriate because it matches the subspecies-level designation. Parent species-only codes or different subspecies would be less specific or incorrect given this exact hierarchy.
46548002,Leukotriene B (substance),Leukotriene B,"The entry explicitly names leukotriene B, which is a biochemical substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This wording maps most precisely to Leukotriene B (substance) [46548002] because it identifies the specific leukotriene subtype without adding numeric specifiers or clinical findings. The broader parent Leukotriene (substance) would be too general, and the child Leukotriene B4 (substance) would be too specific and not supported by the text, as no 'B4' designation is present. Sibling concepts like Leukotriene C or D are clearly not referenced."
313071005,Counseling for harmful pattern of substance use (procedure),Counseling service addressing harmful pattern of substance use.,"The entry denotes a counseling service that addresses a harmful pattern of substance use, reflecting a performed procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It maps to 313071005 because it specifies counseling with the focus on harmful substance use patterns, and does not include attributes like the type of substance, intervention technique, or duration. Parent counseling concepts are less specific, while siblings/children such as psychotherapy, motivational interviewing, brief intervention, or screening are not supported here. Therefore, this wording precisely matches the intended procedure code."
219235009,Assault by striking by blunt or thrown object (event),Event: assault by blunt or thrown object impact.,"The entry denotes an assault event characterized by impact from a blunt or thrown object, without additional qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The most precise mapping is SCTID 219235009 because it encodes assault by striking (impact) via blunt or thrown object. Coding to generic assault would lose mechanism detail, while selecting a single-mechanism alternative would be narrower than the entry’s scope. “Impact” is a clinically equivalent description of the striking mechanism."
415510005,Sedentary lifestyle (finding),Sedentary lifestyle behavior pattern,"This describes a behavior pattern consistent with a sedentary lifestyle, without adding cause or quantitative details. Category is Clinical finding. The most precise SNOMED code is 415510005. Observable entities for activity level or findings about specific exercise behaviors are less suitable than the lifestyle-focused finding expressed here."
309219005,Jejunal biopsy specimen (specimen),Container label: jejunal biopsy specimen,"A practical labeling statement still codifies the concept: a specimen from jejunum obtained by biopsy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. There are no extra attributes such as mucosal layer, instrument, or method specifics, so Jejunal biopsy specimen is the precise match. Parent concepts that generalize to small intestine or GI tract are less specific, and siblings referencing other gut segments would be inaccurate. Child concepts with mucosal qualifiers are not indicated by the label."
119314005,Electrode submitted as specimen (specimen),Electrode described as specimen,"The entry documents that the electrode is described in the role of a specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and Electrode submitted as specimen (SCTID 119314005) precisely captures this. Parent concepts would be overly general, and siblings specifying other device types or tissue specimens would be inaccurate. The phrase does not introduce attributes such as condition, quantity, or body site."
1365672006,History of domestic physically abusive behavior towards another adult (situation),Intake: patient has a history of physically harming an adult domestic partner.,"The entry states a history of physically harming (i.e., physically abusive behavior) an adult domestic partner, reflecting perpetration in a domestic context. The category is Situation with explicit context. SCTID 1365672006 is the precise match because it encodes a history of domestic physical abuse toward another adult. Parent concepts that are less specific or sibling concepts involving child targets or nonphysical abuse do not correspond. 'Physically harming' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of physically abusive behavior and remains within the scope of the concept."
181298001,Entire aorta (body structure),Aorta — entire,"Label-style wording identifies the aorta with the qualifier “entire,” which exactly corresponds to SNOMED CT 181298001, Entire aorta (body structure). The category is Body structure. The explicit completeness qualifier differentiates it from the unspecified parent concept and avoids any specific segment sibling concepts. The format does not introduce new attributes; it’s an equivalent representation of the whole aorta."
224002007,Tutuila (geographic location),Tutuila AS,"Using ""AS"" as a conventional abbreviation for American Samoa still uniquely points to Tutuila while noting the territory context. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The precise code is Tutuila (geographic location), SCTID 224002007. A code for American Samoa alone would be too general, and for specific towns on Tutuila would be too specific. The abbreviation is contextual and does not alter the concept being coded."
702038002,Dressing-supportive arm tube (physical object),Arm dressing support tubular device (tube),"This phrase denotes a physical object using both 'tubular device' and 'tube' to clarify the form, aimed at dressing support for the arm, consistent with the Physical object category. It maps to SCTID 702038002 by specifying arm, tube, and dressing support. Parent concepts that are nonspecific and sibling items of different shapes or for other limbs are not indicated. The synonymic elaboration ensures clarity without adding attributes such as size, laterality, or material."
256741001,Galeal flap (substance),Biological material entry: galeal flap,"The entry classifies the biological material as a galeal flap, emphasizing the material aspect. Category: Substance. Galeal flap (substance) [256741001] is the specific match. It avoids attributes that would trigger a procedure code and is more specific than generic biological material."
439580004,Urine collection pad submitted as specimen (specimen),Urine collection pad specimen.,"This entry states that the specimen is a urine collection pad, directly aligning with the SNOMED Specimen concept 439580004. It does not add attributes like timing, patient age, or testing purpose. Broader parents like 'Urine specimen' would imply liquid urine rather than the device/pad, and siblings such as 'Incontinence pad specimen' or 'Urine bag specimen' are excluded by the explicit 'collection pad' wording. The term is a concise, semantically equivalent synonym for the preferred description."
242199002,Accident to balloon in collision with fixed structure (event),Balloon struck a fixed structure—accident event,"“Struck” is a synonym for collision/impact, and the phrase maintains the balloon and fixed structure elements while affirming it as an accident event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. This aligns with SCTID 242199002 because it captures a balloon colliding with a fixed structure without adding details like injury outcomes or specifying the type of structure. Using “struck” does not change the code selection; parents such as generic balloon accidents are too broad, and siblings like collisions with moving objects or non‑collision incidents do not fit the wording."
104524006,Arginase measurement (procedure),Arginase evaluation,"The phrase denotes an evaluation of arginase by laboratory testing, which is a clinically equivalent way to describe measurement, and does not introduce extra attributes such as specimen or method. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The most precise code is 104524006 Arginase measurement (procedure). Parent concepts (generic enzyme evaluation) are too broad, and more granular children (activity-only or isoform-specific evaluations) are not implied."
424545009,Record composition (record artifact),EMR record composition,"The wording denotes the composition artifact in an EMR system, keeping the focus on the structural composition and avoiding type or status attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This best maps to SCTID 424545009, which represents the composition container of a record. Parent 'Record artifact' would be overly broad, and child/sibling concepts like sections, entries, or specific document types are not implied. 'EMR record composition' is a safe contextual synonym for the same concept."
13491009,Salmonella Brefet (organism),Lab organism name: Salmonella Brefet,"In a laboratory naming context, the entry still solely indicates the organism “Salmonella Brefet” and does not convey detection status, source, or clinical impact. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most precise match is Salmonella Brefet (organism) [13491009]. Parent concepts like Salmonella (organism) are too broad; sibling serovars do not match. The label “Lab organism name” is contextual and does not change the semantic target from the organism identity."
300068008,Nitro group derivative (substance),Nitro moiety derivative,"This entry highlights the derivative nature with respect to the nitro moiety (–NO2), equivalent to 'Nitro group derivative'. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It is appropriately coded to SCTID 300068008, avoiding additional qualifiers or different chemical functionalities like nitroso compounds. Parent classes are too broad, and child/sibling specificities (e.g., nitroaromatic) are not stated, ensuring the chosen concept is the most exact match."
255513008,Inverse (qualifier value),Inverse specified,"The entry communicates that the specified value is “inverse.” This is a Qualifier value and corresponds to SNOMED CT Inverse (255513008). The text does not add clinical context beyond naming the value. Parent-level qualifiers would be imprecise, and sibling labels (e.g., “inverted,” “reversed”) are not used, ensuring no misclassification. Code 255513008 is the most precise selection."
106229004,Qualifier for type of diagnosis (qualifier value),Diagnosis type flag (qualifier value),"Using 'flag' is a common synonym for an indicator or qualifier within records, and 'qualifier value' clarifies the hierarchy. The main concept is the qualifier value that flags the type of diagnosis. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 106229004 matches precisely because it refers to the general attribute for diagnosis type labeling. This entry does not specify any particular type and therefore avoids mapping to child concepts. It also remains distinct from sibling qualifiers that flag other properties. The synonym does not add clinical attributes."
96005000,Drug vehicle (product),Drug vehicle available,"This inventory-style entry still denotes the product concept of a drug vehicle without specifying type or route. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It matches Drug vehicle (product) [96005000], which represents the general vehicle used in medications. Parent-level excipients are broader and child concepts such as named solvents or bases are too specific. The entry does not imply sibling functions (like diluent or emulsifier), keeping the general vehicle code correct."
21066009,Buprenorphine hydrochloride (substance),Diagnostic report index term: buprenorphine hydrochloride,"Listing the index term in a diagnostic report still points to the substance buprenorphine hydrochloride; no detection result, level, or test is stated. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The explicit hydrochloride salt keeps it precise to SCTID 21066009 and avoids observable entity or product-level mappings."
94151000119101,Smoker in household (situation),Household has at least one smoker,"This documents that the household includes at least one smoker, a situational descriptor. No exposure, relationship, or count beyond presence is asserted. Category: Situation. SNOMED CT 94151000119101 is the most accurate match, as it denotes a smoker in the household. Sibling concepts like passive smoking introduce exposure and would be incorrect here. The wording is a semantically equivalent restatement and does not alter the code selection."
420147001,Microsphaeropsis (organism),Microsphaeropsis sp.,"The notation 'sp.' indicates a single unspecified species within the genus Microsphaeropsis, which still maps to the genus-level concept rather than a species-level child. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the most precise code is 420147001 Microsphaeropsis (organism). Parent concepts are too general, and any named species or strains would be more specific than indicated. No clinical finding or disorder is implied, so the organism concept is the correct choice."
431234000,Specimen from fetus obtained by biopsy (specimen),Histology specimen: fetal biopsy,"In a histology context, the specimen is identified as a fetal biopsy, confirming specimen status, fetal origin, and biopsy method. Main concept: specimen; attributes: source = fetus, method = biopsy. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The most precise match is 431234000. Parent concepts without biopsy are too general; organ-specific fetal biopsy specimens would be more specific than stated. Sibling specimens involving blood, fluid, or placental tissue do not apply. The phrasing is a context-based synonym."
69312007,Neisseria cinerea (organism),Chart keyword noted: Neisseria cinerea,"This entry shows Neisseria cinerea as a chart keyword, naming the organism without clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It precisely maps to Neisseria cinerea (SCTID 69312007) at the species level. The absence of presence, causation, or site information means clinical finding or disorder codes and broader/narrower organism concepts are inappropriate."
120827009,Antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans (substance),Patient mentions “antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans”,"Though framed as a patient statement, the referenced item is an antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans, with no added attributes such as isotype, positivity, specimen, or timing. The concept is a Substance and maps to “Antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans (substance)” (120827009). Selecting a parent like a general antifungal antibody or genus-only would be less specific, and children like Ig subclass or test findings would not match the neutral, attribute-free wording. The quotation reflects a synonymous phrasing and does not change the substance concept."
698550009,History of appendicovesicostomy (situation),Reported history of appendicovesicostomy,The entry conveys that the patient has a documented or reported historical appendicovesicostomy. The concept is prior appendicovesicostomy with historical context as the attribute. Category: Situation. This corresponds to SCTID 698550009 and not to procedure execution or broader urinary surgery history. It avoids additional specifics that would require a different code.
712542001,Abstinent from drug misuse (finding),Not engaging in drug misuse (abstinent),"This formulation conveys the same clinical meaning as abstinence from drug misuse, appropriately coded to SCTID 712542001 as a Clinical finding. The parenthetical 'abstinent' clarifies equivalence. It avoids history, remission, or specificity to illicit/prescription categories, making sibling concepts like 'No illicit drug use' or 'Drug-free' less appropriate."
473136009,Lipodystrophy absent (situation),History note: lipodystrophy absent.,This statement documents the absence of lipodystrophy in a history note context without adding time qualifiers beyond the documentation label. It belongs to the Situation category. SCTID 473136009 exactly matches absence of lipodystrophy. Disorder codes or subtype absence codes are not appropriate since only general absence is stated. The history-note context does not introduce attributes that alter the coding.
119340004,Meconium specimen (specimen),Meconium specimen for processing,"The phrase denotes a specimen intended for processing, specifying meconium as the material. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to Meconium specimen (119340004) because the core concept is the specimen type. The processing context does not alter the specimen identity, and thus it is not better coded as a parent specimen, feces/stool specimen, or as the meconium substance."
1156727004,Entire vestibular surface of root of tooth (body structure),Vestibular surface of tooth root — entire,"This entry names the vestibular surface of the tooth root and explicitly qualifies it as 'entire', indicating the whole surface extent. The concept falls under Body structure. The explicit completeness marker ensures mapping to 'Entire vestibular surface of root of tooth' rather than the broader parent concept that could include partial surfaces. It does not shift toward sibling concepts like lingual, palatal, buccal, or labial surfaces. The wording is strictly anatomical and does not introduce other attributes such as disease, procedure, or laterality."
736246006,Pediatric surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Pediatric surgery inpatient care plan documented,"Adding ‘documented’ indicates the record exists without introducing new clinical attributes; the core concept remains a pediatric surgery inpatient care plan as a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This aligns with pediatric surgery inpatient care plan. Parent concepts lack the pediatric surgery inpatient focus, and sibling concepts adding timing (pre/post-op) or different populations/settings do not match the text as written."
442870007,Besifloxacin (substance),Ingredient recorded: besifloxacin,"The entry states that besifloxacin is recorded as an ingredient, focusing on the substance itself rather than a specific drug product. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Besifloxacin (442870007) is the exact match. Any product-level selection would add formulation or brand attributes not present, and parent class concepts would not reflect the specific named chemical."
14658004,Structure of tectoreticular fiber (body structure),Tectoreticular fiber (body structure),"This explicitly labels the tectoreticular fiber as a body structure, which directly corresponds to SNOMED CT SCTID 14658004. The parent categories would be more general (e.g., neural fiber), and sibling tracts are distinct entities; neither is suggested. No additional attributes such as laterality, pathology, or function are present, ensuring the exact structure is the most precise match."
735326005,Upper gastrointestinal surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Upper gastrointestinal surgery inpatient care plan,"The entry explicitly names a care plan for hospitalized patients in the context of upper gastrointestinal surgery, which exactly matches the SNOMED CT concept “Upper gastrointestinal surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact)” (SCTID 735326005). The main concept is a care plan and the attribute is the inpatient setting tied to upper GI surgery. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is more precise than the parent concept of a generic care plan because it specifies both the surgical domain (upper gastrointestinal) and the inpatient milieu. It also avoids sibling concepts such as an outpatient or discharge care plan and does not drift into a pathway or procedure note. The phrasing uses standard synonyms (“care plan” for plan of care) without adding new attributes."
702853006,Eating disorder clinic (environment),Clinic setting: eating disorder clinic,"The term specifies the clinic setting and its focus on eating disorders, which corresponds to 'Eating disorder clinic (environment)' SCTID 702853006. Main concept: environment (clinic setting). Category: Environment. No added attributes like timing or severity are present, and specifying the eating disorder focus makes generic clinic parents or other specialty siblings less appropriate."
472879001,Swab from placenta (specimen),Sample description: swab from placenta,"This description identifies the sample as a swab sourced from the placenta, belonging to the Specimen domain. The most appropriate SNOMED CT concept is “Swab from placenta (specimen)” (472879001). It does not introduce additional attributes beyond type and source, ensuring it is not misclassified as a general placental specimen, a generic swab, or a different anatomical site, thereby excluding parent, sibling, or child concepts."
701859008,Neuromuscular transmission motion sensor (physical object),Neuromuscular transmission accelerometry sensor,"This term specifies an accelerometry-based sensor used in neuromuscular transmission monitoring, i.e., an accelerometer that measures twitch motion. It is a Physical object. SCTID 701859008 is most precise because it covers motion sensors for NMT; accelerometry directly implies motion sensing. A general NMT sensor would be too broad, and EMG electrodes or full monitors are mismatched siblings. The accelerometry synonym does not alter the concept or add extraneous attributes."
718014000,Cone beam computed tomography of chest (procedure),Cone-beam CT chest—radiology,"This documentation-style entry specifies 'cone-beam CT' and 'chest', aligning with the Procedure concept of CBCT of chest. The addition of the word 'radiology' simply situates the context and does not change the procedure’s attributes. It remains more specific than generic CBCT and is clearly distinct from conventional CT chest due to the cone-beam modifier."
16214011000119105,Specimen from trigone of urinary bladder obtained by biopsy (specimen),Biopsy specimen of the trigone of the urinary bladder,"Main concept: specimen from the trigone of the urinary bladder, obtained by biopsy. Attributes: site (trigone of urinary bladder) and method (biopsy). SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This rephrasing is fully synonymous with the FSN and maps to SCTID 16214011000119105. Using a parent concept would reduce specificity by omitting the trigone site; siblings defining other anatomical sub-sites or different collection approaches would be inaccurate. The entry does not introduce diagnosis or other modifiers."
5621000146109,Paenibacillus taiwanensis (organism),Identified microbe: Paenibacillus taiwanensis,"The concept here is the identified microbe Paenibacillus taiwanensis, emphasizing its species-level identity. It matches SNOMED CT Organism SCTID 5621000146109. The synonym 'microbe' is a generic descriptor and does not introduce additional attributes. Parent genus and sibling species concepts are less specific than the stated binomial name, and no disorder is implied."
721080005,Structure of right saphenous vein (body structure),Clinical reference: right saphenous vein,"This denotes a clinical reference to the right saphenous vein, with the only attribute being right laterality. Category: Body structure. It fits SCTID 721080005 because it precisely identifies the right saphenous vein without specifying great or small. Parent terms omit laterality, and sibling or child terms (left saphenous vein or right great/right small) would misrepresent the level of detail. The contextual label does not introduce new attributes."
23791009,Legal execution by guillotine (event),Court-sanctioned capital punishment—guillotine,"The entry specifies court-sanctioned (legal) capital punishment and the guillotine method. Main concepts: court-sanctioned legal execution; guillotine. Category: Event. It precisely matches 'Legal execution by guillotine (event)' rather than a broader legal execution and does not fit sibling methods. 'Capital punishment' and 'court-sanctioned' are clinically equivalent descriptors of legal execution, without adding extra attributes."
736056000,Asthma clinical management plan (record artifact),Asthma clinical management plan established,"This text captures that a clinical management plan for asthma has been established, implying creation of a record artifact. The correct SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, making SCTID 736056000 the precise code. The term does not drift into the act of managing asthma (procedure) or other documentation types like action/care plans. It remains specific to the intended asthma clinical management plan."
446033002,Protected specimen brush (physical object),Instrument: protected specimen brush,"The entry indicates an instrument and names it as a protected specimen brush, which is a physical object device. The term 'Instrument' is contextual and does not alter the intended concept. There is no mention of use, site, or timing, so sibling concepts (e.g., bronchial brush) or parent categories (e.g., specimen brush) are less accurate than the specific protected specimen brush."
9629004,Borderline poverty (economic status) (social concept),Income level corresponds to borderline poverty,"This notes that the patient’s income level maps to the borderline poverty classification, reflecting near-poverty status. The main concept is the economic classification of borderline poverty. SNOMED CT category: Social concept. SCTID 9629004 is the correct code because the outcome is the status itself, not a measurement. Parent concepts (income level unspecified or economic status general) are too broad, and siblings like poverty or low income do not capture the 'borderline' nuance. No cause, severity, or timing is added."
736372004,Discharge care plan (record artifact),Discharge care plan included in discharge packet,"This entry states the discharge care plan document is part of the discharge materials, focusing on the artifact itself. No additional clinical attributes are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Discharge care plan (record artifact) [736372004] is the exact match, as it identifies the care plan created for discharge. Care plan (record artifact) would be too general, and choosing Discharge summary or Discharge instructions would be inaccurate because the term explicitly mentions a care plan. It also does not indicate the procedure of discharge planning. The phrasing maintains semantic equivalence and precise code selection for the artifact."
713334007,Phyto-carotenoid (substance),Inventory record: phytocarotenoids,"This inventory context simply denotes the substance class 'phytocarotenoids,' which is a synonym of 'phyto-carotenoids.' The core medical concept is a Substance with plant origin specified and no additional attributes like lot, dose, or role. The best SNOMED CT match is Phyto-carotenoid (substance) SCTID 713334007. Mapping to general 'Carotenoids' would lose the plant qualifier, and mapping to specific members of the class would be too narrow. Pluralization and the inventory context do not alter the coded substance."
36877009,Lower class economic status (social concept),Lower economic class designation recorded,"The entry states a designation of lower economic class, with no additional qualifiers. This is a Social concept. SCTID 36877009 is the most precise, as it maps to the lower class category within economic status. Alternatives such as lower socioeconomic status, poverty, or economic hardship go beyond the class classification and would be less accurate. The phrasing is a synonym that preserves the same meaning and coding intent."
397245007,Specimen from ovary obtained by hysterectomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy (specimen),Ovary specimen obtained in the setting of hysterectomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy.,This phrasing specifies the ovary as the specimen and identifies the obtaining procedure as hysterectomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to SCTID 397245007 because it captures the exact source and procedure linkage. Parent concepts omit the procedure; sibling concepts alter laterality or add approaches. 'In the setting of' is a common clinical paraphrase equivalent to 'obtained by/during' and does not affect code selection.
169593004,Antenatal care: poor antenatal attender (situation),Antenatal clinic: poor attender,The entry highlights poor attendance specifically at an antenatal clinic and introduces no additional attributes like timing or cause. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It maps to 'Antenatal care: poor antenatal attender' (169593004) because it denotes suboptimal attendance within antenatal care. More specific event-based or absence-of-care codes are less appropriate; this is about a pattern of attendance.
28895007,Sky-diving (qualifier value),Parachuting (sky-diving),"The entry uses 'Parachuting' and clarifies equivalence by specifying '(sky-diving)', ensuring the intended activity is the sky-diving form of parachuting. This remains a Qualifier value and maps to 28895007. It avoids other parachuting modalities that could be siblings (e.g., tandem or static-line as separate qualifiers, if present) and does not introduce attributes such as mechanism or temporal details, so parent or child concepts would be less precise."
369775001,Gleason Score 2-4: Well differentiated (finding),"Gleason scoring result: 2–4, well differentiated","This statement indicates the result of Gleason scoring as 2–4 and well differentiated, directly matching SNOMED CT 369775001 (Clinical finding). No extra attributes like exact numeric patterns, associated disease terms, or timing are included. A broader parent concept would be imprecise, and other range-based siblings would contradict the stated values. “Scoring result” is clinically equivalent wording for the same finding."
33481000087100,Cardiac pacemaker component submitted as specimen (specimen),Cardiac pacemaker component sent to pathology for specimen processing,"This pathology workflow statement describes a specimen consisting of a cardiac pacemaker component sent for processing, falling under the Specimen category. The best SNOMED CT match is “Cardiac pacemaker component submitted as specimen (specimen)” [33481000087100], since the entry makes clear it is a part of the cardiac pacemaker rather than the full device. A parent concept would omit the cardiac pacemaker specificity, and a sibling describing a whole pacemaker specimen would not fit the wording. The use of “component” is clinically equivalent to “part” without adding additional attributes."
171610009,Excision of lesion of oculomotor nerve (III) (procedure),Oculomotor nerve (III) lesion removal,"This statement describes removal (excision) of a lesion affecting the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). It is a SNOMED CT Procedure and most precisely matches SCTID 171610009. The phrase does not include approach, laterality, or etiologic details, so neither broader nor more specific alternative concepts are better. Procedures like biopsy, neurectomy, or decompression would be siblings but are not indicated by the term 'lesion removal.'"
422522004,Record document part (record artifact),Progress note document part,"This entry denotes a part of the progress note as a record document, without identifying the specific subtype of part. The main concept is a part of a record document; no other attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The appropriate code is 422522004 |Record document part (record artifact)| because it captures the concept of a generic part of a record document (here, the progress note). Coding the whole progress note document would be incorrect, and specifying a child such as 'section' or 'header' would be overly specific given the wording. The term remains a semantically equivalent expression of a document part."
224035002,Kitikmeot (geographic location),Region of Kitikmeot,"The wording indicates the geographic region known as Kitikmeot and does not add any extraneous attributes. This aligns with SNOMED CT’s Location category under Geographic location. The exact match is Kitikmeot (geographic location), SCTID 224035002. Selecting a parent like Nunavut would be overly general, and choosing a child concept like a town in Kitikmeot would be too specific. The paraphrase “Region of Kitikmeot” is equivalent to the preferred term, so the same code applies."
736283006,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinical management plan (record artifact),Patient reports having a COPD clinical management plan,"A patient-reported statement that they have a COPD clinical management plan denotes the presence of the plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This maps to SCTID 736283006 because it references a clinical management plan for COPD, not a different plan type or the disease itself. The COPD-specific plan is more precise than the generic parent plan, and the wording does not invoke siblings like care or action plans. The phrasing remains semantically equivalent to the intended record artifact."
768976007,Endoscopic insertion of pH monitoring capsule into esophagus (procedure),Esophageal pH monitoring capsule insertion via endoscopy,"The entry identifies insertion of a pH monitoring capsule in the esophagus performed via endoscopy; category: Procedure. The phrase “via endoscopy” explicitly conveys the endoscopic approach, aligning with SNOMED CT 768976007. Alternative concepts such as general esophagoscopy or pH catheter insertion are less precise or incorrect. The synonyms used do not add attributes and are clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
228219009,Kameez (physical object),Kameez,"The entry names the specific garment 'kameez' with no added attributes, clearly referring to the physical object. This aligns with the SNOMED CT concept Kameez (physical object), which is in the Physical object category. It is more precise than parent concepts like Garment or Clothing and does not suggest sibling items such as Kurta or Shirt. The bare term is an exact match and does not introduce material, style, gender, or other qualifiers, so the specific code for kameez is the most appropriate."
438123000,Streptomyces prunicolor (organism),S. prunicolor (Streptomyces prunicolor),"The abbreviation followed by the full species name unambiguously denotes Streptomyces prunicolor, mapping to the Organism concept 438123000. The added expansion removes ambiguity and does not introduce any clinical attributes (infection, specimen, resistance). Parent genus or other species would not match the explicit species named here."
260560001,Approach via cholecystostomy (qualifier value),Procedural route: cholecystostomy,"The phrase names the route of a procedure as cholecystostomy, capturing the approach via an opening in the gallbladder. This belongs to the Qualifier value category and corresponds to SNOMED CT 260560001. It is more specific than a parent such as general procedural approach qualifiers and does not add attributes that would necessitate a different qualifier (e.g., via laparoscopic port). ""Procedural route"" is a clinically safe synonym for approach and does not change the intended concept."
871487000,Periarticular bone structure of sternoclavicular joint (body structure),Exam target area—periarticular bone of the sternoclavicular joint,The phrase identifies the anatomical exam target as the periarticular bone of the sternoclavicular joint. Category: Body structure. It aligns with SCTID 871487000 by specifying both the joint and the periarticular bony nature. It avoids parents like SCJ overall or siblings like cartilage and introduces no findings or qualifiers.
89177007,Proton (substance),Proton,"The entry explicitly names the particle “proton,” which is the SNOMED CT substance concept (SCTID 89177007). No additional attributes (e.g., cause, timing, therapy context) are introduced. The category is Substance. This precisely matches the proton particle and is more specific than parent concepts like subatomic particle; it avoids sibling concepts such as neutron or electron, and it does not imply procedure concepts like proton beam therapy or physical objects like a proton beam."
309280002,Vaginal biopsy specimen (specimen),Vaginal biopsy sample (tissue),"This entry identifies a tissue sample obtained by biopsy from the vagina. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It aligns with 309280002 by combining the site and biopsy-based tissue nature. A parent like “Vaginal sample” or “Biopsy sample” is too vague, and siblings like “Vaginal swab sample” would reflect a different material type. Adding “(tissue)” is a clarifier that does not alter the concept choice."
118010002,Picornavirus identification (procedure),Picornavirus identification procedure,"This entry directly names the procedure of identifying picornavirus, with no further qualifiers. The main concept is picornavirus identification; the category is Procedure. It perfectly aligns with Picornavirus identification (procedure). Broader parents (e.g., Virus identification procedure) lack the picornavirus family specificity, and narrower children (specific genus/method) are not referenced. The entry maintains neutrality on specimen, method, results, and purpose, ensuring precise mapping."
404568005,Salmonella IIIb 48:(k):z53 (organism),Salmonella IIIb 48:(k):z53,"The entry explicitly names the organism Salmonella IIIb 48:(k):z53, a specific Salmonella serovar defined by antigenic formula 48:(k):z53 within subspecies IIIb. No additional attributes such as site, condition, timing, or resistance are introduced; it is solely the organism designation. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the most precise match is SCTID 404568005. Broader parents like generic Salmonella or subspecies-only concepts would be less specific, and any sibling concept referring to a different antigenic formula would be incorrect. Because the wording exactly mirrors the preferred term, it does not change the code selection."
59956004,Rhacochilus vacca (organism),Identified as Rhacochilus vacca,"This report-style wording states an identification consistent with the species Rhacochilus vacca. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Although it mentions identification, no extra attributes (e.g., exposure, injury) are introduced; the core concept is solely the organism. The specificity excludes parent genus or sibling species, fitting SCTID 59956004."
105052002,Acrylonitrile measurement (procedure),Acrylonitrile testing (quantitative),"Specifies that the acrylonitrile testing is quantitative, which denotes a measurement procedure. It avoids introducing specimen, timing, or indications. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps to SCTID 105052002 'Acrylonitrile measurement (procedure)'. Parent concepts of general toxicology testing are broader, and children with matrix details are not implied. The explicit 'quantitative' qualifier disambiguates from qualitative detection siblings."
223670009,Malta (geographic location),Place: Malta,"The term designates Malta as a place without indicating any clinical attribute like residence or travel. In SNOMED CT, it belongs to the Location hierarchy, subtype Geographic location. The most specific code is 223670009 Malta (geographic location), which corresponds to the country. A broader parent is insufficiently specific, and city/region children or siblings are not indicated. The label 'Place' is merely a contextual descriptor and maintains equivalence."
464917007,Sternum knife (physical object),Record entry: sternal knife,"This is a record entry naming a sternal knife, referring to the same Physical object as the preferred term. The documentation context does not add clinical attributes or subtype information. A parent Knife code would discard the sternum-specific designation, and siblings are not implied. Therefore, SCTID 464917007 is the most precise mapping."
45436009,Tenebrio alpha-proteinase (substance),Label text: Tenebrio alpha-proteinase,"A labeling context does not alter the identity of the named substance; it remains Tenebrio alpha-proteinase. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. This maps precisely to SCTID 45436009. Parent concepts without Tenebrio origin or siblings lacking alpha specificity would be less precise, and species-specific children are not indicated. No dosing, reaction, or temporal attributes are added."
272511002,Municipal and civic establishment (environment),Originating location: municipal and civic establishment,"This entry indicates the originating location as a municipal and civic establishment, correctly mapping to SNOMED CT 272511002 (environment). The 'originating location' label is contextual and does not add attributes altering the concept. The wording avoids specifying a particular municipal venue, so children are not preferred, and it is more specific than broader environmental location parents. Sibling environment types are clearly not implied. Therefore, the precise match is the Municipal and civic establishment (environment) concept."
279629000,Structure of junction of vas and seminal vesicle duct (body structure),Junction of ductus deferens with ductus of seminal vesicle,"Using formal anatomic terminology, the entry identifies the junction point unambiguously, corresponding to SNOMED CT 279629000 as a Body structure. No attributes beyond the structure are present. It separates this junction from the ejaculatory duct formed after the junction and from the individual ducts themselves, making parent or sibling concepts less accurate. The synonymy is clinically equivalent."
411807003,Gasterophilus intestinalis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Supply: Gasterophilus intestinalis diagnostic allergen extract,"This entry indicates a supplied product identified as a diagnostic allergen extract of Gasterophilus intestinalis. SNOMED CT category: Product. The term “Supply” is contextual and does not introduce clinical attributes; the essential concept remains the diagnostic allergen extract product. Parent concepts without species detail and sibling concepts such as therapeutic extracts are not appropriate. Therefore, SCTID 411807003 best captures the exact product described."
102818007,"Lithium renal clearance, function (observable entity)",Kidney lithium clearance,"The phrase makes explicit that lithium clearance is via the kidney, i.e., renal clearance. It represents an observable physiologic parameter, not a test or diagnosis, and maps to SCTID 102818007 (Observable entity). The wording does not add severity, laterality, values, or timing. Parent concepts are overly broad, and procedure codes (e.g., tests) are not indicated, keeping this entry uniquely aligned to the specified observable."
224501006,Caregiver lives at a distance (finding),Social history: caregiver lives at a distance,"The entry documents, within social history context, that the caregiver lives at a distance from the patient. It remains a Clinical finding. The best SNOMED CT match is 224501006, which specifically denotes caregiver distance. Contextual placement (social history) does not change the concept, and alternatives like caregiver present/absent or cohabitation would not reflect the geographic separation described."
705223003,Centrifuge (physical object),Record includes a centrifuge,"This is a documentation-style statement that names a 'centrifuge' and no additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The most accurate mapping is Centrifuge (physical object), SCTID 705223003. Selecting a parent like Device would be too general, while choosing a specific subtype would be unjustified. There is no indication of a procedure or component, preventing misclassification to related but distinct concepts."
29011000087100,Specimen from abscess of lung (specimen),Sample from pulmonary abscess,"This phrase identifies a sample taken from a pulmonary (lung) abscess, establishing it as a specimen with the source site defined. 'Pulmonary' is a synonym for 'lung' and maintains semantic equivalence. The best match is the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 'Specimen from abscess of lung' (29011000087100). Parent concepts that lack the pulmonary specification are too general, and children that detail specific specimen types are not supported by the wording. Sibling concepts focused on other respiratory sources or disorders would be incorrect given the explicit abscess origin."
1290248002,Electrical power disruption (event),Interruption of electrical power supply,"The wording describes an interruption affecting the electrical power supply, which fits exactly the target event. The SNOMED CT category is Event; Electrical power disruption (event) [1290248002] is the correct, specific match. Using broader event parents or sibling concepts for other utilities would reduce specificity. The phrase introduces no additional attributes and is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
161685006,History of tracheostomy (situation),Medical history significant for tracheostomy,"The phrase indicates that the patient’s medical history includes a prior tracheostomy. This is a Situation concept and the exact match is SNOMED CT 161685006. The entry does not convey that a tracheostomy is currently present or in progress, avoiding misclassification to presence or procedure codes. The word ‘significant’ does not introduce clinical attributes beyond the existence of history, so the mapping remains precise."
369749000,Exophytic (polypoid) tumor configuration (finding),Morphologic configuration of tumor is exophytic polypoid.,"By specifying ‘morphologic configuration’ as exophytic polypoid, the entry denotes the outward, polyp-like growth of the tumor without adding site or behavior information. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. This is precisely the scenario encoded by SCTID 369749000. More general morphologic or configuration codes would omit critical detail, and other growth configurations would not match the text."
441397005,Sanguibacter keddieii (organism),Laboratory organism name: Sanguibacter keddieii,"The entry provides the organism name in a laboratory context, Sanguibacter keddieii, without implying results or clinical status. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The precise mapping is SCTID 441397005. Using a parent concept (genus) or related taxa would be less specific. The lab context does not add attributes like positivity or site, so the species-level organism concept is the most accurate code."
443087004,Saxagliptin (substance),Formulary ingredient entry: saxagliptin,"The entry reflects inclusion of saxagliptin as an ingredient within a formulary, focusing on the substance itself rather than any particular product or dose. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The exact match is Saxagliptin (substance), SCTID 443087004. Mentioning a formulary context does not alter the concept to a product or administration; parent drug classes or different DPP-4 inhibitors would be less precise."
223536003,Seychelles (geographic location),"Seychelles, sovereign state","This phrasing describes Seychelles as a sovereign state, which is a clinically safe synonym for the country’s geographic location. No relational attributes (residence, travel, event site) are added. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location, and Seychelles (geographic location), SCTID 223536003, is the exact code. Parent concepts are too general, and neither child sublocations nor sibling nations are indicated."
2664007,Above ground residential swimming pool (environment),Safety checklist notes presence of an above-ground swimming pool at the residence,"This statement documents the environmental presence of an above-ground swimming pool at a residence as part of a safety checklist, which still only specifies residential location and above-ground pool type. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It corresponds precisely to SCTID 2664007 “Above ground residential swimming pool (environment).” Parent or sibling concepts would omit either the residential or above-ground qualifier. Mentioning a checklist does not introduce any new clinical attributes, maintaining accurate coding."
411801002,Blatta orientalis diagnostic allergen extract (product),"Diagnostic allergen reagent, Blatta orientalis","This text identifies a diagnostic allergen reagent and specifies Blatta orientalis as the source. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It is the most precise match for SCTID 411801002, not a parent or sibling concept, because it is species-specific and diagnostic. The term “reagent” is a synonymous labeling for a diagnostic allergen extract."
224632003,Mixed sex boarding school (environment),Coeducational boarding school,"This entry uses the synonym coeducational to denote mixed sex and explicitly states boarding school, which together exactly represent Mixed sex boarding school (environment), SCTID 224632003. The main concept is an environment specifying both coeducational status and boarding. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Using only coeducational school would map better to a mixed sex school without the boarding attribute, and using only boarding school would be too broad; therefore the combined phrase is the most precise match. Coeducational is a standard synonym for mixed sex and does not change code selection."
736850007,Entire mucosa of vocal fold (body structure),Patient description: the entire lining of the vocal fold,"Patient-style wording “entire lining” corresponds to the complete mucosa, with “vocal fold” as the anatomical site. This is a Body structure mapping to 736850007. Parent or sibling concepts would either omit completeness or shift to other structures. “Lining” is commonly used to denote mucosa and remains clinically equivalent without adding attributes."
250828001,Absolute humidity (observable entity),Water vapor concentration in air (absolute humidity),"The wording denotes the concentration of water vapor in air and clarifies '(absolute humidity),' which aligns with the standardized observable for mass per volume. Category is Observable entity. This avoids broader 'Humidity' or alternate measures like 'Relative humidity' or mixing ratio. It introduces no measurement act, numerical value, or context modifiers, so the SNOMED concept Absolute humidity (250828001) is the correct selection."
445667001,Interim report (record artifact),Interim report provided to patient,"This describes the distribution of the document to the patient, but the document itself is an interim report, which matches Interim report (record artifact), SCTID 445667001. The category is Record artifact. The phrase “provided to patient” is a contextual detail of delivery and does not imply a different document type or a clinical finding. Parent concepts like Report (record artifact) would be too vague, and sibling concepts (Final report, Preliminary report) are incorrect because the entry specifies interim status, making 445667001 the most precise match."
118353006,Violet laser light (physical force),Violet laser light recorded in history,"History documentation context is provided without changing the nature of the concept; it still denotes 'violet laser light' as a physical force. No attributes implying exposure, duration, intensity, or clinical effect are added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and Violet laser light (physical force) [118353006] is the exact match. Parents like 'Laser light' lack specificity, and siblings representing other colors would be incorrect. The entry remains uniquely codable to the physical agent."
385600003,"Ribbon retractor, device (physical object)",Patient describes the instrument as a ribbon retractor,"This patient-reported context still centers on the specific device—the ribbon retractor. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). The phrasing does not introduce attributes like size, material, damage, or retention; it only names the instrument type. Therefore, broader parent or alternative retractor types are inappropriate, and SCTID 385600003 is the precise match."
350067007,Product containing prostaglandin (product),Medication list: prostaglandin-containing drug,"In a medication list context, 'prostaglandin-containing drug' denotes a medicinal product with prostaglandin as the active ingredient, mapping to the Product concept 350067007. No extra attributes are included, so parent concepts are too broad and children naming specific products or formulations would be too narrow. The term 'drug' is equivalent to 'medicinal product' in clinical documentation."
1252677005,Actiniaria venom (substance),Order Actiniaria venom,"The phrase explicitly ties the venom to the taxonomic order Actiniaria, i.e., sea anemones, and represents a substance. No clinical scenario or measurement is implied. It is exact to SCTID 1252677005 and more specific than general venom or cnidarian venom parents, without narrowing to species-level children. Sibling venoms are excluded by the taxonomic reference, ensuring a precise Substance category mapping."
257567003,Badminton court (environment),Setting: badminton court,"This indicates the environmental setting and names it as a badminton court, with no additional clinical attributes. Main concept: badminton court environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (environment). Badminton court (environment) [257567003] is the precise code; parent concepts like 'sports setting' or 'sports court' are too general, and siblings are sport-specific but incorrect. 'Setting' is a contextual descriptor and does not affect code selection."
164779007,Special cardiovascular system test abnormal (finding),Follow-up: abnormal special cardiovascular test noted,"This follow-up note indicates recognition of an abnormal special cardiovascular test. No extra attributes like severity, timing details, or a specific test type are included. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It aligns with SCTID 164779007, reflecting an abnormal finding on a special cardiovascular system test. The contextual ‘Follow-up’ label does not affect coding. Parent-level special test abnormal is too broad, and child/sibling concepts tied to particular tests are not supported by the text."
288566000,General practice examination room (environment),Assigned to general practice examination room,"This documentation phrase indicates assignment to the general practice examination room, focusing on the environment. The main concept is a location in a general practice setting used for examination. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The exact code is General practice examination room (environment), SCTID 288566000. Using the parent Examination room (environment) would omit the specialty context, while siblings (consulting room, waiting room) denote different functions. The workflow term 'Assigned' does not change the environmental concept or add attributes."
258467004,Nasopharyngeal washings (specimen),Specimen type—nasopharyngeal washings,"This entry identifies the specimen type explicitly as nasopharyngeal washings, which fits the SNOMED CT Specimen concept 258467004. The term does not introduce unrelated attributes or alternative collection methods; therefore, it is more precise than a parent concept (e.g., nasopharyngeal specimen) and does not map to siblings such as nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate."
224689004,Young offenders center (environment),Service location: young offenders center,"The phrase defines the service location as a young offenders center, which is a pure environmental context. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 224689004 is the most precise match, as it identifies the exact facility type for young offenders. Parent concepts like prison/correctional facility are too general, and alternate youth facility siblings are not indicated. The synonymy is maintained without adding attributes beyond location."
119303007,Microbial isolate specimen (specimen),Microbiology lab specimen: microbial isolate,"This line indicates that the microbiology lab specimen is specifically a microbial isolate, placing it in the Specimen category. The wording avoids organism class, source, or any additional qualifiers. Parent specimens are too general, while organism-specific isolate child concepts would add specificity not present. It differentiates from culture specimens and clinical findings. SCTID 119303007 is therefore the most accurate code."
1332511003,Mammographic digital tomosynthesis - action (qualifier value),Imaging action attribute: mammographic digital tomosynthesis,"This phrasing identifies the imaging action attribute explicitly as mammographic digital tomosynthesis, limiting the semantics to the action qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 1332511003 is the most precise match because it captures tomosynthesis as the mammographic digital method. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling procedure concepts (e.g., 3D mammography procedure) would add unintended semantics of performance. The wording includes no extra attributes (e.g., indication, laterality), ensuring a clean mapping to the action value."
263904004,Traumatic (qualifier value),Mechanism classification: traumatic,"The phrase sets the mechanism classification to “traumatic,” using the qualifier value role of SNOMED CT 263904004 (Traumatic). The category is Qualifier value. No condition, site, severity, timing, or specific type of trauma is stated; it is an attribute label only. Coding to a disorder or finding such as traumatic injury or trauma would be incorrect because the entry does not assert an injury event. Sibling qualifiers are not implied. This is a valid contextual synonymic framing that preserves the same coding intent as “traumatic.”"
373141002,Possible thrombus (situation),Cannot rule out thrombus,"The wording indicates uncertainty, stating that the existence of a thrombus cannot be ruled out, without specifying site or other details. This maps to SNOMED CT 373141002, Possible thrombus (situation), reflecting potential presence. Definitive thrombus concepts (disorder/finding) are not appropriate, and terms indicating screening or evaluation would shift focus away from the possibility itself; the phrasing fits the possible context exactly."
242023009,Asphyxia by burial under powder or solid matter (event),Suffocation from being surrounded by powder or solid matter,"The phrase indicates suffocation (equivalent to asphyxia) resulting from being surrounded by powder or solid matter, which matches the mechanism of burial under such materials and corresponds to SCTID 242023009. Category: Event. It avoids extra attributes and excludes alternative mechanisms like strangulation or drowning. Parent-level suffocation/asphyxia is less specific; avalanche or cave-in siblings are not suggested by the wording."
1441000119105,Exposure to streptococcal pharyngitis (event),Exposure to streptococcal pharyngitis,"The entry states exposure to the disease entity streptococcal pharyngitis, without adding timing, severity, or other qualifiers. This aligns directly with the SNOMED CT Event category and the specific concept Exposure to streptococcal pharyngitis (event) [1441000119105]. Broader parent concepts like Exposure to communicable disease would be less specific, and sibling concepts such as Exposure to streptococcal infection would be too broad because they include non-pharyngeal streptococcal infections. The wording maps precisely to this event exposure and does not imply infection or symptoms."
409390007,Product containing calcium-sensing receptor activator (product),Calcium-sensing receptor activator medicine,"The phrase denotes a medicine (product) whose action is activation of the calcium-sensing receptor, which matches SNOMED CT 409390007 under Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It introduces no added attributes like ingredient names, dose form, or indication, so child concepts such as cinacalcet-containing products are not appropriate. Broader parent product concepts lack mechanistic specificity, and sibling mechanisms (antagonists) are contradicted by the ‘activator’ wording."
411585001,Fox epithelium diagnostic allergen extract (product),Fox epithelial allergen extract — diagnostic use,"The entry indicates an allergen extract from fox epithelial tissue and its diagnostic intended use, aligning directly with the product concept. Category: Product. The term “epithelial” is a clinically acceptable synonym of “epithelium” and does not change the source. The diagnostic context disambiguates from therapeutic extracts, and the wording does not add dosing, concentration, or procedural details, making parent or sibling concepts less appropriate."
287231004,Foreign body of iris removed by magnet (situation),Iris foreign body—removed via magnet,"This conveys that an iris foreign body has been removed and that the removal was via magnet, aligning with a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 287231004 precisely covers the iris site with magnet removal. Using a broader code for removal without method detail would lose specificity, and disorder codes for ongoing foreign body presence would be incorrect given the removal. Sibling concepts targeting other ocular structures or techniques (e.g., needle or forceps) are not appropriate. “Via magnet” is a direct paraphrase of “removed by magnet,” retaining equivalent meaning."
116720009,Hemoglobin C E O A>2< region electrophoresis pattern (observable entity),Template label — Hemoglobin C/E/O A>2< region electrophoresis pattern,"This final entry presents the concept as a template label, but it still denotes the specific electrophoresis pattern for the C/E/O hemoglobins in the A>2< region. It is an Observable entity and corresponds to SCTID 116720009. The entry avoids any clinical interpretation or measurement. Parent categories without the explicit region and variant grouping are too broad, and child/sibling concepts targeting different regions or individual variants are too narrow or misaligned. The contextual phrase 'Template label' does not introduce new attributes."
77926000,Urologic (qualifier value),History section labeled urologic,"The entry indicates that a history section is labeled with the qualifier 'urologic', functioning only as a descriptor. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This is accurately represented by Urologic (qualifier value) [77926000]. No disease, procedure, or specialty service is stated, hence 'Urology' or urinary system disorders would be less precise mappings."
258515000,Coronal sulcus of penis swab (specimen),Swab taken from the coronal sulcus of the penis,"A narrative documentation indicating a swab was taken specifically from the penile coronal sulcus, thereby defining a specimen. It maps to the Specimen hierarchy and best fits SCTID 258515000. The wording avoids broader or different site concepts and introduces no time, severity, or etiologic attributes. As a paraphrase, it remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
385436007,Population (social concept),Population focus noted in documentation,"The documentation notes a focus on the population concept, with no added qualifiers. This fits SNOMED CT 385436007 Population (social concept). More specific or related concepts (e.g., population health, at-risk population, community) are not indicated, making them less appropriate. Category: Social concept."
83319004,Spore test (procedure),Biologic indicator spore testing,"This entry is a synonymic paraphrase indicating spore testing using a biological indicator, which is conventional and does not add device, outcome, or timing attributes. The main concept is the spore test procedure. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 83319004 best fits the concept. Parent concepts like general biological indicator procedures are too broad, and child/sibling concepts specifying device types or test results would be too narrow. The synonym 'biologic indicator spore testing' is clinically equivalent to 'spore test' in this quality assurance context."
3491000146109,Candidozyma auris (organism),Taxonomic entry: Candidozyma auris,"This text treats Candidozyma auris purely as a taxonomic entry, with no clinical attributes implied. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The species-level designation corresponds directly to SCTID 3491000146109. Broader parents or genus-level concepts would be less precise, and no other species or alternative names are invoked. Absence of terms like 'detected' or 'infection' ensures it remains an organism concept rather than a finding or disorder. The 'taxonomic entry' label is contextual and does not change code selection."
165465007,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate outside reference range (finding),RBC sedimentation rate out of range,"Main concept: the RBC (erythrocyte) sedimentation rate is out of range. No indication of high versus low is included, and no other qualifiers are present. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. 165465007 fits because it represents ESR outside reference range in a non-directional manner. Generic parent concepts are less specific, and siblings that specify increased or decreased ESR are not appropriate here. RBC sedimentation rate is a synonym for ESR; out of range aligns with outside reference range."
314332006,Structure of clitoridal artery (body structure),Vessel name recorded: clitoral artery,"Here, the clitoral artery is identified as a named vessel, but the content remains the anatomical structure without additional attributes or clinical findings. There is no mention of laterality, pathology, or procedural details. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. The precise match is Structure of clitoridal artery (SCTID 314332006). More general vessel categories would not reflect the specific clitoral artery, and branch-level child concepts would be too specific for this wording. The phrasing is a documentation context that still denotes the same anatomical entity."
223518003,Sudan (geographic location),Country name recorded: Sudan,"This documents the country name as Sudan; the codeable entity is the geographic location Sudan in the Location category. No added features such as citizenship or administrative subdivisions are included, so it is not better mapped to any parent, child, or sibling concept. SCTID 223518003 is the precise match."
223573000,Kazakhstan (geographic location),Country of residence: Kazakhstan,"This entry identifies Kazakhstan as a residence country; however, the concept represented remains the geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Location—Geographic location. SCTID 223573000 is appropriate because a specific nation is being named. The parent “Country (geographic location)” is too general, and no child location such as a city or province is specified. The residency context does not change the underlying coded concept; it remains the country Kazakhstan."
266891008,Family history of central nervous system disorder (situation),Family history of central nervous system disorder,"The entry states a family history attribute paired with the non-specific target condition category of the central nervous system. The main concept is a situation with explicit context: a family history of a CNS disorder. In SNOMED CT, this maps most precisely to 266891008 (Situation with explicit context). Parent concepts like “Family history of disorder” are too broad, and siblings such as “Family history of nervous system disease” would include peripheral nervous system conditions and therefore are not as precise. No specific CNS disease (e.g., epilepsy, brain tumor) is named, so child concepts are not indicated."
468916005,Environmental sensor (physical object),Environmental sensor hardware,"The entry identifies hardware that functions as an environmental sensor, still expressing a physical device for general environmental sensing. It fits the Physical object category and maps to Environmental sensor (physical object), SCTID 468916005. Broader parents omit the environmental qualifier; narrower children specify a measured variable (e.g., temperature, CO₂). 'Hardware' is a synonym indicating a physical device and does not introduce new attributes, so this wording remains correctly coded to 468916005."
56884009,Structure of postcentral gyrus (body structure),Structure: postcentral gyrus,"This entry explicitly frames the term as an anatomical structure, identifying the postcentral gyrus without additional attributes. The main concept is the postcentral gyrus as a body structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This maps most precisely to Structure of postcentral gyrus (SCTID 56884009). Using a parent like 'Parietal lobe' would lose specificity, and a sibling like 'Precentral gyrus' would be a different cortical fold. No functional labeling is introduced, so child or sibling concepts like 'Primary somatosensory cortex' are not indicated."
712787004,Ustilago nuda diagnostic allergen extract (product),"Ustilago nuda diagnostic allergen extract, for diagnostics","The entry reiterates diagnostic use and specifies the source organism Ustilago nuda, clearly representing a Product—diagnostic allergen extract. The phrasing does not add attributes like formulation or test method, so the exact SNOMED concept 'Ustilago nuda diagnostic allergen extract (product)' is most appropriate. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., non-diagnostic allergen extract, therapeutic extract) are excluded by the wording."
238221000087103,Prosthetic total arthroplasty of left ankle (procedure),Left total ankle arthroplasty,"This entry denotes a Procedure involving complete replacement of the left ankle joint; 'arthroplasty' in this context implies prosthetic joint replacement. The term specifies laterality (left) and total joint involvement (total), mapping exactly to SCTID 238221000087103. It avoids additional attributes like revision, approach, or timing, and does not suggest fusion or partial procedures, making parent concepts (ankle arthroplasty unspecified) and sibling concepts (partial arthroplasty, right ankle total arthroplasty) less precise. 'Total ankle arthroplasty' is a clinically standard synonym for prosthetic total ankle replacement."
21427009,Tetractinomyxon intermedium (organism),Tetractinomyxon intermedium,"The entry is the exact scientific binomial name of the organism, referring solely to the taxonomic entity Tetractinomyxon intermedium. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This precisely matches SCTID 21427009, which represents the organism concept. There are no added attributes such as infection, location, severity, timing, or causation; it is simply the organism name. A parent concept like the genus Tetractinomyxon or any sibling species would be less specific, and child concepts (e.g., particular strains) are not implied. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not change code selection."
223581004,China (geographic location),Reported location: China,"This provides a location value from a report and names China. The concept is the geographic location under the Qualifier value hierarchy; China (geographic location) SCTID 223581004 matches precisely. Parents are too general, and children/siblings like other countries or regions do not fit the wording. The entry contains no extra attributes or events; it simply denotes the place."
429423007,History of Lyme disease (situation),Chart notes indicate history of Lyme disease,"This entry references medical records showing that the patient had Lyme disease in the past. The main concept is a personal historical condition, which is a Situation in SNOMED CT. History of Lyme disease (situation) SCTID 429423007 fits exactly. Parent concepts like History of disease are too broad, and coding Lyme disease (disorder) would imply active disease. The phrasing is a documentation context but retains the same concept."
297211001,Transvascular approach (qualifier value),Transvascular procedural route,"The phrase denotes the procedural route as transvascular, meaning via the vascular system, with no additional attributes like vessel type or site. It is a Qualifier value and maps precisely to Transvascular approach (SCTID 297211001). Parent approach qualifiers do not capture the vascular detail; children such as transvenous/transarterial would be over-specific. Endovascular/intravascular siblings imply intraluminal procedures and thus are less appropriate."
143824007,Structure of intraglandular parotid lymph node (body structure),Intraglandular parotid node (lymph),"The entry uses “node (lymph)” to clarify that the node is lymphatic and specifies intraglandular within the parotid gland. The main concept is an anatomical lymph node situated in the parotid gland tissue. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It aligns with SCTID 143824007 due to the explicit intraglandular parotid lymph node reference. Removing “lymph” could create ambiguity, but including it ensures it does not map to non-lymph nodes. Parent or sibling concepts without intraglandular specificity are less appropriate."
40358007,Non-judicial execution (event),Execution without judicial sentence,"An execution carried out without a judicial sentence indicates non-judicial execution. Category: Event. This is narrower than Execution (event) and clearly not Judicial execution (event). The entry avoids specifying mechanism or perpetrators, keeping the mapping precise to Non-judicial execution."
371524004,Clinical report (record artifact),Documented as a clinical report,"This entry asserts that the documentation is a clinical report, directly naming the artifact. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and matches Clinical report (record artifact) SCTID 371524004. It avoids attributes that would suggest children like Operative report, Laboratory report, or Imaging report, and is more constrained than the parent 'report' by specifying the clinical nature."
31628002,Hospital-based outpatient family medicine clinic (environment),Family medicine clinic — hospital outpatient setting,"This wording specifies a family medicine clinic in a hospital outpatient setting, i.e., a hospital-based ambulatory environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The hyphenated format does not change attributes; it clearly conveys all required elements. A parent such as “Hospital outpatient clinic” lacks the family medicine detail, and “Family medicine clinic” lacks the hospital-based outpatient qualifier. Therefore, 31628002 is most accurate."
51728003,Structure of thalamosensory cortical fibers of internal capsule (body structure),Sensory thalamocortical fibers within the internal capsule,"The concept focuses on the sensory thalamocortical fiber system located within the internal capsule, without extra attributes like laterality or limb segment. This is a Body structure description. The exact SNOMED match is SCTID 51728003, which defines the structure of thalamosensory cortical fibers of the internal capsule. A parent such as “Thalamocortical fibers” without the internal capsule location would be too broad, and any child specifying a particular limb of the capsule would be too narrow given the phrasing. “Sensory thalamocortical” is clinically synonymous with “thalamosensory,” maintaining code equivalence."
358265009,Potassium free hemofiltration solution (product),No-potassium hemofiltration solution,"This phrasing defines a hemofiltration solution with no potassium. The main concept is a product used in hemofiltration characterized by potassium absence. SNOMED CT category: Product. “No-potassium” is clinically equivalent to “potassium-free,” so SCTID 358265009 is the correct match. It avoids additional attributes like buffer type or brand, and is more specific than the parent “Hemofiltration solution” while excluding sibling concepts with potassium."
70549008,Insertion of catheter for central venous pressure monitoring (procedure),History note: CVP catheter placement,"Within a history context, the entry still denotes the procedural action—placement of a catheter for CVP monitoring—without adding method or site. Category: Procedure. The appropriate code remains SNOMED CT 70549008 since the concept is the insertion for CVP monitoring. More general central venous catheter insertion would omit the monitoring intent, and observational CVP monitoring is not a device insertion. The context label does not alter the underlying procedure being coded."
713019007,New patient screening done (situation),New patient screening done.,"The main concept is that the new patient screening has been completed, expressed by the term “done.” This corresponds to a Situation with explicit context in SNOMED CT, not a procedure, because the wording indicates the status of completion rather than the act itself. The most precise match is SNOMED CT 713019007 New patient screening done (situation). A parent concept like generic “screening done” would be less specific, and a sibling or child such as a particular type of screening (e.g., depression screening) would add attributes not present. The phrasing uses a clear completion synonym and does not introduce timing, cause, severity, laterality, or other attributes."
714337009,Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy report (record artifact),EGD report,"“EGD” is the accepted abbreviation for esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and pairing it with “report” specifies a record artifact documenting an upper GI endoscopic procedure. The category is Record artifact. This matches SCTID 714337009 because it is specifically an upper GI endoscopy report. A more general parent (e.g., “Endoscopy report”) misses the upper GI scope, and a procedure code would not describe the document. No timing, severity, or findings are implied; the term remains focused on the artifact."
701733000,"3-prong lower-limb prosthesis socket adaptor, receiver (physical object)",3-prong receiver component for lower-limb prosthetic socket adaptor,"The entry specifies a receiver component, indicates the lower-limb prosthetic context, and the 3-prong configuration, all tied to a socket adaptor. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 701733000 best fits because it denotes the receiver subtype of a lower-limb prosthesis socket adaptor with a 3-prong interface. More generic parent concepts lacking either the receiver designation or the 3-prong qualifier, and sibling variants for different limb or adaptor types, would be less appropriate. The term 'component' is contextual but does not alter the device identity or introduce new attributes."
22151000087106,Paper report (record artifact),Paper report on file,"The phrase identifies a report in paper format, with “on file” as contextual location. The artifact category is Record artifact, mapped precisely to Paper report (record artifact) SCTID 22151000087106. Parent concepts lacking medium are less specific, and electronic or digital siblings are inconsistent with the explicit paper format."
1193576007,Arthroscopy of ankle with removal of loose body (procedure),Operative report: ankle arthroscopy and loose body removal,"Operative report context still describes the same Procedure: arthroscopy of the ankle combined with removal of a loose body. No additional steps or attributes are introduced. A more general parent (ankle arthroscopy) or a different method (open removal, foreign body removal) would not match. The conjunction 'and' maintains equivalence to 'with' and does not alter code selection."
75277002,Oncogene protein H-RAS (substance),HRAS oncogene protein,"This phrasing identifies the protein product of the HRAS oncogene and denotes the same substance as the preferred term. No additional attributes such as abnormal variants, test results, or disease states are present, ensuring accurate Substance coding. A parent like “Oncogene protein” would be nonspecific, and siblings such as K-RAS/N-RAS would not match the stated protein. SCTID 75277002 is the most precise code for HRAS oncogene protein."
773590002,Dietetic care plan (record artifact),Dietetic care plan write-up,"A write-up describing the dietetic care plan still represents the care plan as a record artifact. The wording does not imply action, regimen, or associated conditions—only the plan’s documentation form. It thus fits SCTID 773590002 rather than the generic care plan or any procedural/regimen sibling concepts."
309957000,Neuropathology department (environment),Consultation venue: Neuropathology department,"The text specifies the venue of consultation as the Neuropathology department, highlighting the environment rather than the clinical act. The concept belongs to Environment or geographical location. The best code is Neuropathology department (environment), SCTID 309957000. Mapping to a consultation procedure or to a broader/sibling department would be less precise, since the entry focuses on the setting. The term “venue” does not change the concept; it confirms the department as the environment."
242212000,Accident to glider in collision with tall structure (event),Care summary: accident to glider via collision with tall structure,"This care summary records an accident to a glider and specifies the mechanism as collision with a tall structure. The primary concept is the event, with no added attributes beyond the collision detail. It falls under the SNOMED CT Event category. SCTID 242212000 is the precise code because it encodes a glider accident in collision with a tall structure. A parent concept without the collision mechanism would be less specific, and a child naming a particular structure would be too detailed. The phrase “via collision” is semantically equivalent to “in collision,” not altering the intended coding."
110961009,Chorion cytologic material (specimen),Chorion cytologic material identified as specimen,"The material is cytologic and sourced from the chorion, explicitly labeled as the specimen, which maps to 'Chorion cytologic material (specimen)' SCTID 110961009. Category: Specimen. The wording avoids introducing method or timing. Parents would be overly broad, and siblings like placenta or amnion cytologic materials would not match the stated chorion source."
736386000,Major vascular surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Major vascular surgery inpatient care plan.,"The entry names a care plan specifically tied to inpatient hospitalization for a major vascular surgery. The explicit attributes are major (scope of surgery), vascular surgery (clinical domain), inpatient (setting), and care plan (document type), which together define a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. This precisely matches the concept of a major vascular surgery inpatient care plan as a documented plan of care. Broader parents like generic care plan or inpatient care plan alone would omit either the vascular or major qualifiers, and siblings like vascular surgery inpatient care plan (without 'major') or major surgery inpatient care plan (without 'vascular') would be less exact. The wording directly reflects the preferred term, ensuring the most precise code selection."
441548002,Tropical medicine department (environment),Location: tropical medicine department,"The label 'Location:' is contextual but the coded concept is the tropical medicine department as a place. Main concept: environmental department location. SNOMED CT category: Environment. The exact match is Tropical medicine department (environment) [441548002]. Coding to broader hospital department or to services/clinics would be less precise. The entry does not add care modality, referral, or encounter details; it just designates the environment, preserving the specific department code."
701920000,"Abdominal hernia surgical mesh, synthetic polymer (physical object)",Surgical device: synthetic polymer abdominal hernia mesh,"This describes a surgical device, specifically an abdominal hernia mesh constructed of synthetic polymer. It is a Physical object and aligns with SCTID 701920000. The phrasing does not add procedural status, presence, or site detail beyond 'abdominal hernia', and no brand or variant is mentioned. A parent concept without the material attribute would be less exact, while sibling materials (biologic, metal, composite) are ruled out by the explicit synthetic polymer descriptor. The synonymic ordering does not change the semantics."
1149163003,Revised International Staging System for multiple myeloma (staging scale),Clinic intake: myeloma staging system selected is the Revised ISS,"This intake note indicates that the selected staging system for myeloma is the Revised ISS, clearly identifying the R-ISS scale without adding a stage or other attributes. It fits the Staging scale (Assessment scale) category and should be coded to SNOMED CT 1149163003. A parent concept would be overly generic, and sibling staging systems are excluded because the entry specifies 'Revised ISS.' No child stage levels are provided, so stage-specific codes are not relevant. 'Revised ISS' is a clinically equivalent synonym for R-ISS."
45207006,Dexamfetamine sulfate (substance),Dextroamphetamine sulphate,"This variant uses US 'dextroamphetamine' with UK 'sulphate,' still indicating the sulfate salt of the D-isomer. The entry avoids dose, route, brand, and temporal context, focusing solely on the substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise concept is Dexamfetamine sulfate (substance), SCTID 45207006. Broader or alternate siblings such as the base form or racemic amphetamine sulfate would be less accurate. The mixed spelling synonym is clinically equivalent, maintaining the same code selection."
428942009,History of fall (situation),Documented prior fall event,"The entry denotes a previously occurring fall that has been documented, i.e., History of fall, fitting SNOMED’s Situation with explicit context. It avoids additional attributes such as mechanism, severity, or recurrence. Coding to active fall findings or broader history categories would be less accurate, and more specific child concepts would require details not present here."
1306665006,Photographic extraoral image of full face with full smile and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Frontal full-face extraoral photograph—full smile in centric relation.,"This describes an extraoral frontal full-face photograph with a full smile and jaws in centric relation. Category: Record artifact. It fits SNOMED CT 1306665006. A purely 'frontal' image could risk ambiguity, but 'full-face' clarifies the view, avoiding siblings like profile or partial-face artifacts; and specifying centric relation excludes occlusal or rest-position variants. The terms remain synonymous and do not alter the intended concept."
315197004,Tetanus immunoglobulin G level (procedure),Tetanus IgG antibody level analysis,"“Analysis” here refers to performing a laboratory procedure to quantify the level of tetanus-directed IgG antibodies. Attributes are antigen (tetanus), antibody class (IgG), and property (level). This fits the Procedure category. SCTID 315197004 accurately codes this measurement. Broader parent concepts (general antibody levels) and sibling procedures (antibody titer, IgM level) are less suitable given the specificity to IgG and level. The synonym “analysis” is equivalent to a measurement in lab contexts and does not add extraneous attributes."
277183381000119101,History of traumatic subdural hematoma (situation),Neurology consult: history of traumatic subdural hematoma per records,"The consult note specifies that records show a history of traumatic subdural hematoma, emphasizing past occurrence. This fits the Situation category. The best code is 277183381000119101, which explicitly encodes history of traumatic subdural hematoma. A disorder code would indicate active disease, which is not stated. A parent like History of subdural hematoma (unspecified cause) is less specific than the trauma-qualified wording, and siblings such as nontraumatic variants would contradict 'traumatic.' No added attributes beyond historical context are present."
430802005,Family history of procedure on ovary (situation),Family history: procedure involving ovary,"The phrase sets a family history context and describes a procedure involving the ovary, which directly aligns with the intended anatomical site and intervention class. SNOMED CT category: Situation. It is most precisely matched to 430802005 because it indicates a procedure on the ovary but avoids specifying the type, cause, timing, or laterality. A parent like “Family history of procedure” lacks the ovary focus, while children naming specific ovarian procedures would not be supported by the wording. “Procedure involving ovary” is a safe paraphrase of “procedure on ovary.”"
1010715006,Excision of right uterine adnexa (procedure),Procedure: excision of right uterine adnexa,"This documentation line names the procedure as excision of the right uterine adnexa, with clear laterality and no extra qualifiers. It is a Procedure in SNOMED CT, and SCTID 1010715006 is the exact match. Less specific parents lack laterality; left/bilateral siblings are incorrect; and organ-specific excisions are too narrow. The wording mirrors the preferred term, ensuring an unambiguous mapping."
129292007,Evacuation - action (qualifier value),Documented action: evacuation,"The main concept is evacuation identified as the documented action in a clinical note. Category: Qualifier value. This matches 129292007 by denoting the action attribute only, with no mention of site, target material, or timing of performance. Sibling actions are not suggested, and the 'documented' context does not change the qualifier’s semantics. Thus the code selection remains precise."
224053008,Lanai (geographic location),Event location noted as Lanai,"This notes the location of an event, with the value “Lanai,” a geographic place. Main concept: Lanai (geographic location). Attribute: event location context; no additional clinical qualifiers are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). SCTID 224053008 is the correct code, not a parent region or child locality. The term is clearly the island/place, not an architectural feature."
411213001,Corticosteroid series (product),Corticosteroid therapeutic class,"This names the therapeutic class of medicinal products that are corticosteroids, which aligns with the SNOMED CT product series concept. The best match is 411213001 in the Product hierarchy. Broader classes (steroid) and narrower subclasses (glucocorticoid) would be inappropriate as the entry refers to the entire corticosteroid class. No attributes such as indication, route, or formulation are added, preserving the series-level granularity."
248753002,Capillary refill (finding),Capillary refill recorded in chart,"The statement emphasizes that the capillary refill finding is recorded, with no attributes about speed, time, or normality. The Clinical finding Capillary refill (SCTID 248753002) is the most precise match. Procedure codes for assessment are not warranted because the focus is the presence of the finding entry, not the act of assessment. Child or sibling concepts requiring qualifiers or measurements are not supported."
113243005,Structure of superior pubic ligament (body structure),Structure of superior pubic ligament,"This entry explicitly identifies the anatomical entity as the structure of the superior pubic ligament, aligning exactly with a Body structure concept. It maps precisely to SCTID 113243005 because it uses the same preferred wording and scope. Mapping to a parent like Structure of pubic ligament would be too general, and mapping to siblings (e.g., inferior pubic ligament) would not match the specified superior location. No pathological or procedural attributes are present; the entry solely denotes the anatomical structure."
298469007,Increased passive range of cervical spine left rotation (finding),"Documented increased passive ROM of cervical spine, left rotation","This documentation notes increased passive range of motion of the cervical spine specifically during left rotation, a Clinical finding. It maps to SCTID 298469007. Parent concepts lacking laterality and passive detail are less specific; sibling concepts indicating right rotation or active motion are incorrect. 'ROM' is a standard synonym for range of motion; the entry adds no cause or extent."
411581005,Duck feathers diagnostic allergen extract (product),Allergy testing reagent: duck feather diagnostic allergen extract,"The phrase describes the product as a reagent for allergy testing, specifically a diagnostic allergen extract from duck feathers. Main concept: diagnostic allergen product; attributes: source and diagnostic purpose. Category: Product. It matches 411581005. Parent concepts are overly broad, and therapeutic allergen extract siblings or other bird sources would be incorrect. 'Reagent' is a common synonym for testing product in this context and does not introduce new attributes such as route or concentration."
87309006,Death of unknown cause (event),Expired; cause of death undetermined.,"The term 'expired' is a common clinical synonym for death, and 'cause of death undetermined' specifies the unknown cause. This exactly aligns with 'Death of unknown cause' (87309006) in the Event hierarchy. No details about mechanism or manner are provided, so alternatives like 'Unexpected death' or 'Undetermined manner of death' are not supported. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent and do not add attributes."
294243007,Allergy to flavoxate (finding),Allergies list: flavoxate,"The phrase indicates flavoxate appears on the allergies list, identifying the specific allergen without any reaction attributes. The main concept is an allergy to flavoxate. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It maps to Allergy to flavoxate (finding) SCTID 294243007 precisely, as it denotes the presence of this specific drug allergy. Generic parents like Drug allergy would lose detail, and siblings such as adverse reaction or intolerance would misclassify the statement."
255897001,Oleamidopropyl dimethylamine (in water) (substance),Oleamidopropyl dimethylamine dissolved in water,"The phrase 'dissolved in water' conveys the aqueous state of the compound, equivalent to 'in water.' The main concept is the substance; SNOMED CT category: Substance. No additional attributes such as concentration or use are introduced, and the description excludes alternative solvents or product contexts. Therefore, it matches SCTID 255897001 better than parent (neat compound) or sibling concepts."
338376003,Suspensory systems (physical object),Patient reports having a suspensory system,"The main concept documented is the presence of a suspensory system as a physical object possessed/used by the patient; no details on type, location, or mechanism are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). This maps to SCTID 338376003 because it identifies the device class without extra attributes. A parent device code would fail to capture the suspensory nature, and a child code would require specifics not stated. The patient-reported context does not alter the underlying device concept; it simply frames the documentation style."
441694006,Specimen from axillary lymph node obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),FNA biopsy sample—axillary lymph node,"This entry denotes a sample (specimen) obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy from an axillary lymph node. The main concept is a specimen with specified site and method. It belongs to the Specimen category in SNOMED CT, with 441694006 as the precise match. More general parent concepts omit either site or method, and sibling concepts with different biopsy types are excluded. 'FNA biopsy sample' is a clinically synonymous phrasing for the same specimen type and does not change the coding."
442922000,Streptococcus pyogenes type emm20 (organism),"Microbiology: GAS, emm20","Within a microbiology context, 'GAS' denotes Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), and 'emm20' specifies the typing result. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This succinctly encodes the organism Streptococcus pyogenes type emm20, mapping to SCTID 442922000. A general GAS organism would be a parent and less specific; other emm types are siblings. No test outcome beyond identification of the organism is implied."
299640004,Toe joint - hot (finding),Hot toe joint,"This phrasing identifies a toe joint with the characteristic of being hot. The concept is the presence of increased heat at a toe joint, with no additional information like timing, cause, or laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym of “Toe joint - hot,” mapping exactly to 299640004. More general parents like “Joint - hot” lack the toe-specific site, and any child concepts specifying particular toe joints would be overly granular since this entry does not indicate which joint."
699864008,Maxilla residual ridge finding (finding),Upper jaw residual ridge finding,"Here, the concept is a clinical finding involving the residual ridge of the upper jaw, which is the maxilla. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 699864008 is appropriate because 'upper jaw' is clinically synonymous with maxilla, preserving the exact site. A broader residual ridge finding without site would be less precise, and mandibular residual ridge finding (sibling) would be incorrect. There is no mention of specific ridge morphology or pathology, so no child concept is indicated."
263844007,Maternal postnatal period (qualifier value),Postpartum period (maternal),"This entry conveys the maternal time period after childbirth using the synonym 'postpartum' and explicitly states maternal context, with no other attributes. It belongs to the Qualifier value category. SCTID 263844007 is appropriate because 'postpartum period' in maternal context is clinically equivalent to 'maternal postnatal period.' Using a generic 'postnatal period' would be too broad and potentially neonatal, and terms like 'immediate postpartum' would be too specific. It does not imply a finding or a care activity, so sibling concepts like postpartum state (finding) or postpartum care (procedure/encounter) are not a better fit."
279316009,"Atrioventricular (non-mitral, non-tricuspid) valve structure (body structure)","Specimen annotation: atrioventricular valve tissue—non-mitral, non-tricuspid","This entry annotates a specimen as atrioventricular valvular tissue that is explicitly non-mitral and non-tricuspid. The main concept is anatomical tissue/structure; the attribute is the exclusion of the named valves. Category: Body structure. SCTID 279316009 is the precise mapping because it covers AV valve structures other than mitral and tricuspid. The parent concept would be too broad, and child concepts identifying specific valve types would not fit. 'Tissue' is a valid synonym for anatomical structure in this context and does not change the code selection or add unintended attributes."
309078004,Lymph node tissue specimen (specimen),Follow-up notes reference lymph node tissue specimen,"This follow-up context references a specimen that is lymph node tissue without adding attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Code 309078004 matches exactly, as it denotes tissue from a lymph node used as a specimen. More general parent concepts (lymphoid tissue) or more specific children (sentinel node tissue, prepared variants) would misrepresent the neutral wording. No method, laterality, timing, or preparation information is provided."
309486005,Excised submandibular gland specimen (specimen),"Operative specimen—submandibular gland, excised","This states an operative (surgically obtained) specimen from the submandibular gland via excision, which is equivalent to the excised specimen concept. Category: Specimen. ""Operative"" here serves to reinforce surgical excision without adding extra attributes; it avoids broader ""surgical specimen"" that could include biopsies, keeping the mapping precise to SCTID 309486005."
728288002,Entire dorsal pancreatic duct (body structure),Entire dorsal pancreatic duct,"This entry uses the FSN-style wording that denotes the whole anatomical structure of the dorsal pancreatic duct, with no extra attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and the exact code match is Entire dorsal pancreatic duct (SCTID 728288002). It is more precise than the parent concept of pancreatic duct and does not suggest a sibling such as the main/ventral/accessory ducts. No segmental or partial specification is present, making child concepts like portions or segments inappropriate."
426569006,Family Mycosphaerellaceae (organism),Follow-up note mentions Mycosphaerellaceae family,"In a follow-up documentation context, the entry simply mentions the organism taxonomic family Mycosphaerellaceae, without any clinical qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The specificity aligns with the family level; broader fungal classes or narrower genus/species are not referenced. The synonymic phrasing still represents Family Mycosphaerellaceae, supporting code 426569006."
236966000,Cervical ripening with Prostaglandin E2 (procedure),Cervical ripening employing dinoprostone.,"The term dinoprostone is synonymous with prostaglandin E2, so this denotes cervical ripening with PGE2, mapping to SCTID 236966000 in the Procedure hierarchy. No further attributes like route or formulation are supplied, which would otherwise suggest child concepts. The parent concept is too general without the agent, and sibling concepts (misoprostol/mechanical) are inappropriate."
24544007,"L-erythro-3,5-Diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase (substance)","Record notes: L-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase","‘Record notes’ is contextual metadata; the substance named is precisely L-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase. No attributes such as activity measurement, deficiency, or test are included, keeping it within the Substance category. Parent concepts are broader and less precise; sibling concepts involving different stereochemistry are not referenced. SCTID 24544007 is the exact match for the named substance."
282798004,Non-standard dietary quantity per feed (qualifier value),Per-feed portion size is non-standard,"Using 'portion size' to denote quantity of diet per feed, marked as non-standard, matches 'Non-standard dietary quantity per feed' (SCTID 282798004). The key concept is quantity per feeding with the qualifier 'non-standard.' Category: Qualifier value. The entry does not suggest increase/decrease, specific unit amounts, frequency, route, or composition, thereby avoiding misclassification to sibling qualifiers or findings. The synonym 'portion size' is acceptable and does not change the intended code."
3560001000004100,Presence of ductal carcinoma in situ at superior surgical margin in excised breast specimen (observable entity),Superior surgical margin contains DCIS in the excised breast specimen,"The entry confirms that the superior surgical margin of an excised breast specimen contains DCIS, which directly conveys presence at that margin. The concepts are DCIS, superior margin orientation, and excised breast specimen context, fitting an Observable entity describing a pathology finding. A parent concept for margin DCIS without orientation would be less specific, and siblings for other margins or invasive histology would be inaccurate. Using “contains” is a permissible synonym indicating presence without adding other qualifiers, keeping the code precise."
82327001,Cardiac fluoroscopy (procedure),"On imaging, cardiac fluoroscopy","This entry indicates that the imaging modality used was fluoroscopy applied to the heart, consistent with cardiac fluoroscopy. It does not introduce attributes like contrast or interventional steps. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 82327001 is the correct, specific match. Parent concepts would be under-specified, and child/sibling procedures like coronary angiography or chest fluoroscopy do not fit the wording. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent to cardiac fluoroscopy and supports the same code."
412958004,Urine glutamate measurement (procedure),Urine glutamate measurement procedure,"By explicitly calling it a 'measurement procedure' of glutamate in urine, this entry cleanly maps to SNOMED CT 412958004 (Procedure). It identifies analyte and specimen precisely and avoids broader parent concepts and siblings with other specimens. No new attributes such as timing, severity, or methodology variants are introduced, preserving exactness."
1187353005,Structure of distal urethra (body structure),Region of interest: distal urethra,"This entry indicates the anatomical region of interest is the distal urethra, with no implied findings. It belongs to the Body structure category. The appropriate code is Structure of distal urethra (SCTID 1187353005), as it denotes the distal part specifically. Parent concepts are too broad, and child/sibling concepts like meatus or anterior urethra are either too narrow or different; no extra attributes are present."
284438004,Trade and service environment (environment),Trading and service environment,"Using ‘trading’ as a verbal form preserves the meaning of trade, paired with service, describing the same environment classification. The entry introduces no attributes beyond the environment type. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 284438004 best fits because the wording aligns with trade-and-service domains. Parent concepts like generic environments are too broad, and this does not specify any child environment such as a restaurant or bank, keeping it at the correct level."
208681000,Entire midcervical section of neck of femur (body structure),Surgical field: full midcervical femoral neck,"The entry indicates the surgical field is the full midcervical femoral neck, i.e., the entire midcervical section. The main concept is anatomical; 'full' is a synonym for 'entire'. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps exactly to SCTID 208681000 and not to a parent or sibling anatomical region. No laterality or condition is implied, and the 'full' qualifier disambiguates from a partial midcervical area, ensuring the entire segment is intended."
11158002,"Electromyographic monitor and recorder, device (physical object)",EMG machine for monitoring and recording electromyographic signals,"The entry describes the EMG machine’s function—monitoring and recording electromyographic signals—consistent with the device concept SNOMED CT 11158002. Main concept: EMG monitor/recorder device. Category: Physical object (Device). It is not a procedure, nor does it reference other modalities or accessories. The descriptive wording reflects the inherent function of the device and remains the most precise match rather than a parent generic monitor."
104233009,Antiviral susceptibility test (procedure),Antiviral resistance testing,"‘Resistance testing’ is the complementary term to susceptibility testing and is used interchangeably in laboratory practice to assess whether a virus is resistant or susceptible to antivirals. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This formulation remains general—no virus, no technique—so SCTID 104233009 is the most precise match. Broader antimicrobials or narrower virus/method-specific tests would not fit the neutral, general scope of the entry."
293685007,Allergy to cascara (finding),Allergy to Rhamnus purshiana (cascara),"This names the botanical species Rhamnus purshiana and clarifies it as cascara, describing an allergic disposition to that specific substance. Category: Clinical finding. The exact code is Allergy to cascara (finding), SCTID 293685007. Using the scientific name does not broaden or shift the concept; it references the same allergen. Parent concepts (e.g., allergy to plant) are less specific, and reaction-event codes are excluded by the absence of an episode."
13859001,Premature birth of newborn twins (finding),Pediatric admission: twin newborns—premature.,"The entry conveys that both newborn twins are premature, framed in an admission note. Concepts: twins and prematurity. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. This maps to SCTID 13859001, which specifically represents premature birth of newborn twins. Choosing a generic prematurity code or singleton prematurity would be less precise, and maternal delivery-related codes would be wrong context. The dash is stylistic; ‘premature’ is a direct synonym for ‘preterm’ and does not affect coding."
10523000,Entire vein of the brain stem (body structure),Anatomical entity: vein of brainstem,"This entry identifies the anatomical entity as a vein in the brainstem and introduces no attributes of pathology, laterality, or specific naming. It corresponds to the SNOMED CT Body structure “Entire vein of the brain stem” (SCTID 10523000). Broader parents would be insufficiently specific, and sibling vessel types would be incorrect. Without naming a particular brainstem vein, child concepts are not appropriate. The phrase is a clinically equivalent synonym."
14502000,"Supination, function (observable entity)",Supination function metric,"The phrase treats supination function as a metric—an observable construct—without specifying any measurement outcome. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It is precisely SCTID 14502000, targeting the function related to supination. Parent concepts like general functional metrics or child concepts such as specific supination impairment do not fit because no result, specificity, or abnormality is conveyed. The synonym does not change the intended code."
30408003,Babesia caballi (organism),Babesia caballi taxonomic label,"The phrase conveys a taxonomic label and provides the exact species name Babesia caballi, with no mention of disease, host, or test outcomes. In SNOMED CT this is an Organism concept best represented by Babesia caballi (organism), SCTID 30408003. Parent genus or broader classifications would be less specific, and other Babesia species would be wrong by epithet. The 'taxonomic label' context does not alter the concept."
1362037004,Scheie gonioscopy grading system (staging scale),Scheie classification for gonioscopy,"The text refers to the Scheie classification as applied to gonioscopy, clearly denoting the named grading system without including a particular grade or result. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value (staging scale). The most precise code is 1362037004 for the Scheie gonioscopy grading system. Parent concepts like generic classification or staging scales are too nonspecific, and siblings such as alternate gonioscopy classifications would be wrong. Since no stage or grade is specified, child grade concepts are not appropriate."
16213051000119108,Indwelling catheter tip submitted as specimen (specimen),Indwelling catheter tip submitted as specimen,"The text specifies that the specimen is the tip of an indwelling catheter and that it has been submitted as a specimen. The main concept is a specimen derived from an indwelling catheter tip, with the explicit attribute being its source (indwelling catheter tip). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This exactly matches SNOMED CT 'Indwelling catheter tip submitted as specimen' (16213051000119108). Broader parent concepts like generic device specimens or catheter tip specimens without the indwelling qualifier are less precise, and child or sibling concepts that identify a specific catheter type (e.g., central venous, urinary) or different collection forms (e.g., swab) would be too specific or different. The phrasing uses the preferred term directly, ensuring correct code selection."
411842004,Acarus siro diagnostic allergen extract (product),Acarus siro (flour mite) diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry presents the same product and clarifies the common name flour mite while retaining the precise species Acarus siro, along with diagnostic intent and extract form. This is a SNOMED CT Product and matches SCTID 411842004. Using the common name in parentheses does not alter the code, since the scientific name is present and unambiguous. Parent concepts like unspecified diagnostic allergen extracts are too general, and sibling concepts such as “Acarus siro therapeutic allergen extract” are inappropriate because they denote treatment rather than diagnostics. Substance-only concepts are excluded because this wording indicates a manufactured extract product."
251013007,Pulmonary valve area (observable entity),Echo parameter: pulmonic valve area,"This entry labels the pulmonic valve area as a parameter within an echo context but does not introduce a method-specific observable or a procedure—it simply names the observable. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity; the correct code is Pulmonary valve area (observable entity) SCTID 251013007. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings like aortic or mitral valve area are incorrect given the pulmonic valve is specified."
102961009,Normal evoked potential (finding),Normal evoked potential,"This phrase is a direct statement of a normal evoked potential finding, expressing only the normality of the evoked potential without any additional attributes. It maps most accurately to SNOMED CT 102961009 Normal evoked potential (finding) within the Clinical finding category. A more generic parent would lack the normal designation, while any abnormal or modality-specific child or sibling concepts are not indicated by this wording."
1303664000,Denervation of right hip joint (procedure),Right hip joint articular denervation,"Adding “articular” clarifies the joint-specific nature without introducing technique or indication, making it synonymous with denervation of the right hip joint. This is a Procedure concept. SNOMED CT 1303664000 is the most exact match, as it denotes denervation at the right hip joint. Parent concepts without laterality are overly broad, and siblings like left hip joint denervation do not match. Absence of method details ensures the base denervation procedure remains the correct code."
444950001,Inpatient nursing record (record artifact),Inpatient nursing record referenced,"The entry indicates that the inpatient nursing record artifact was referenced, which identifies the specific document type without introducing other details. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps precisely to Inpatient nursing record (record artifact), and not to parent, child, or sibling concepts like general nursing record, nursing notes, care plans, or admission/discharge records. The synonym choice does not affect code selection."
32338002,Systemic poison chemical warfare agent (substance),Chemical warfare agent (systemic poison),"This parenthetical notation directly qualifies the chemical warfare agent as a systemic poison, representing the Substance concept SCTID 32338002. It does not introduce exposure, diagnostic, or therapeutic context, and no specific agent subclass is named. The parent 'chemical warfare agent' alone is too general, while children like 'nerve agent' or 'blood agent' are not implied. The parenthetical qualifier is a straightforward synonym that preserves code precision."
73563001,Hexose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (substance),Hexose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase,"This is a spacing variant of the same enzyme name, still referring to the exact same biochemical substance. Category: Substance. The phrase precisely denotes the guanylyltransferase for hexose-1-phosphate and does not add timing, severity, or etiologic attributes. Parent concepts such as Transferase (substance) are too broad, and siblings specifying other nucleotide groups (e.g., uridyl- or adenyl-) do not fit the 'guanylyl' wording. The minor orthographic variation ('Hexose 1-phosphate' vs 'Hexose-1-phosphate') is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not change code selection."
364054002,Characteristic of cough (observable entity),Questionnaire: cough characteristics,"Within a questionnaire context, this entry labels the observable entity used to collect descriptive properties of cough, without specifying any particular characteristic. The concept is the attribute of cough. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. It maps to 364054002, the general characteristic of cough observable. Using Cough (finding) would imply the symptom; choosing specific characteristic findings or sibling observables like severity/frequency would add details not present. The context does not change the coding."
465534002,Total wrist carpus prosthesis (physical object),Wrist carpus total replacement device,"The entry denotes a device that provides total replacement of the wrist carpus; “replacement device” indicates a prosthesis. Categorically, this is a Physical object (device) and not a procedure. The focus on the carpus and total replacement makes it more precise than generic wrist prosthesis parents and excludes partial or non-carpus siblings. The wording is a safe synonym and does not add attributes such as laterality or timing."
368387001,Entire skin of palmar surface of thumb (body structure),Whole integument of the thumb’s palmar surface,"The term 'integument' denotes the skin, and 'thumb’s palmar surface' specifies the location, while 'whole' conveys entire coverage of that palmar area. The main concept is a Body structure representing an anatomical site. It is the best match for SCTID 368387001 because it focuses on palmar skin and its entirety. Parent concepts that include non-palmar areas or siblings for dorsal surfaces are less precise. 'Integument' is a legitimate synonym for skin and does not introduce new attributes."
61861000000100,Consent (record artifact),Consent entry exists in EHR,"This entry states that a consent artifact exists as an entry in the electronic health record, clearly referencing a recorded document. It aligns with the Record artifact category and matches Consent (record artifact) SCTID 61861000000100. It avoids event/timing or type attributes, making more specific consent types or situation codes inappropriate. “Entry” is a neutral synonym indicating a record item."
698268008,Clostridium novyi-NT (organism),Catalogued organism — Clostridium novyi-NT,This represents an organism catalog entry specifying Clostridium novyi-NT. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The NT designation ensures correct mapping to 698268008 and distinguishes it from the parent species or other taxa. The catalog context is non-clinical and does not introduce attributes beyond the organism identity.
368138007,Entire subcutaneous olecranon bursa (body structure),Superficial bursa at the olecranon,"The wording refers to the superficial (subcutaneous) bursa located at the olecranon, which is an anatomical Body structure. This unambiguously maps to SNOMED CT 368138007. It avoids parent-level ambiguity (e.g., any elbow bursa) and excludes sibling structures such as the subtendinous olecranon bursa by specifying superficial positioning."
411732006,Mytilus edulis diagnostic allergen extract (product),Mytilus edulis diagnostic allergen material,"The entry denotes a diagnostic allergen material derived from Mytilus edulis, indicating a product for allergy testing. Attributes include species and diagnostic material, with no addition of route, dose, or results. This maps to the Product category and matches Mytilus edulis diagnostic allergen extract (SCTID 411732006). General allergen materials without species are parent-level and less specific, and other species would be sibling concepts. The term 'material' here is a clinically acceptable synonym that still reflects the diagnostic allergen extract product."
711436000,Inhaled steroids used daily (situation),Pulmonary clinic note: daily ICS use,"The entry states daily use of ICS, where ICS stands for inhaled corticosteroids, indicating the inhaled route and daily frequency. This is a Situation with explicit context describing ongoing medication use. It fits “Inhaled steroids used daily (situation)” precisely. Parent concepts omitting daily timing are less specific, and siblings like PRN ICS or oral steroids daily differ in frequency or route. The abbreviation ICS is a clinically accepted synonym for inhaled corticosteroids and does not introduce additional attributes."
365544001,Finding of attendance at work (finding),Goes to work,"As a patient-stated phrasing, 'Goes to work' communicates attendance at work, fitting SNOMED CT 'Finding of attendance at work' (365544001), a Clinical finding. It does not introduce timing (e.g., today or currently), frequency, or ability; it is a generic statement of attendance. Parent concepts around employment status or social role are broader and less precise, while siblings like non-attendance or return-to-work are not implied. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent to attendance."
365985003,Finding of drug injecting equipment hygiene (finding),Drug injecting equipment hygiene — finding documented.,"The main concept is a clinical finding concerning the hygiene of equipment used for drug injection, stated without any qualifiers or outcomes. This aligns with SNOMED CT category Clinical finding and matches SCTID 365985003 exactly. It does not assert good or poor hygiene, nor add timing, cause, or associated behaviors, so narrower children such as poor hygiene or sterile equipment findings would be less appropriate. The wording uses a direct paraphrase of the preferred term with “finding documented,” which preserves the same semantic scope and does not change code selection."
184813002,Government department employee - report only (record artifact),Lab report annotation: government department employee — report only,"The entry is framed as a lab report annotation to convey context, but the coded concept remains “government department employee — report only,” ensuring it is an administrative artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 184813002 exactly aligns with documenting a government department employee for reporting purposes only. Other concepts tied to occupations or specific agencies would not be as accurate."
286146007,Ability to clean domestic sanitary facilities (observable entity),Capacity to clean home sanitary facilities,"This phrasing uses 'capacity' as a clinically equivalent synonym for 'ability,' still referring to the specific domestic sanitary facilities cleaning task in the home context. No additional attributes (performance status, assistance, frequency) are introduced. It is best classified as an Observable entity and maps to SNOMED CT 286146007. A parent concept like capacity for domestic tasks is too broad, while a child concept focused on a single fixture (e.g., toilet only) would be too narrow. Statements of actual ability or inability would be sibling findings rather than the observable."
15375005,Product containing phenanthrene derivative (product),History note: phenanthrene derivative drug product,"In a history context, the term identifies a drug product defined by inclusion of a phenanthrene derivative. There are no added attributes such as dosing, route, formulation, or named active. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product (product). SCTID 15375005 fits because it classifies products containing phenanthrene derivatives. Parent concepts would be too broad, and child concepts specifying particular derivatives would be too narrow for this generic wording. The contextual label does not affect the product code selection."
118362008,Yellow laser light (physical force),Noted: yellow laser light,"The note simply records the presence of the physical agent yellow laser light without introducing a finding of exposure, use, or harm; it remains the concept itself. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. The precise code is 118362008 Yellow laser light (physical force). Parent concepts like Laser light are not specific enough, and sibling yellow non-laser light would be inaccurate. No child-level details such as specific wavelength or pulse mode are given."
223762009,Bohol (geographic location),"Bohol, PH","The use of ‘PH’ clarifies the country while keeping the referent as the named place Bohol. This matches Bohol (geographic location), SCTID 223762009, in SNOMED CT’s Location/Geographic location hierarchy. The country indicator is a contextual clarifier, not a different concept or subtype, so child/sibling options (e.g., island/province variants) are not more appropriate. Parent concepts are less specific."
228822003,Extended focus skin distance (observable entity),Extended focus-to-skin distance attribute,"The wording treats the concept as an attribute while naming it directly as extended focus‑to‑skin distance. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 228822003 is the exact code because it captures the extended form. Using a parent observable without 'extended' would be less precise, and sibling concepts (source‑to‑skin distance, focus‑to‑film distance) are distinct geometric measures. The term 'attribute' is a framing device and does not add detail beyond the concept."
160409001,Family history: Alopecia (situation),Patient reports a family history of alopecia,"This patient-reported statement documents alopecia among relatives, fitting the Situation with explicit context model for family history. The precise SNOMED CT code is Family history: Alopecia (situation) [160409001]. Parent concepts (e.g., unspecified family history) would be too generic, and sibling or child concepts specifying alopecia subtypes or negative histories do not match. The patient-reporting context does not change the code selection; it still denotes family history of alopecia without extra attributes."
217922003,"Accident caused by explosion of, on, or in, machinery (event)",Patient states: accident occurred due to machine explosion,"This patient-reported wording indicates the accident occurred due to a machine explosion, maintaining the necessary causal and machinery details. The concept is an external cause event; no injury or location details are added. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 217922003 fits best because it encodes accidents caused by explosions of, on, or in machinery. A parent “accident due to explosion” lacks machinery specificity, and a sibling “machine explosion” without accident would be incomplete. Patient-reported context does not alter the event coding."
1306646003,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Captured extraoral photograph: 45° view of left half of face, lips closed, teeth in centric occlusion.","This narrative notes the capture of an extraoral photograph depicting a 45-degree view of the left half of the face with lips closed and teeth in centric occlusion. The concept is a Record artifact. The language closely mirrors the preferred term, preserving all attributes that distinguish it from parent concepts (e.g., unspecified extraoral photos) and siblings (e.g., right side or open mouth). Thus, SCTID 1306646003 is the precise match."
765054000,External cardiac electrode (physical object),External cardiac electrode,"The main concept is an electrode intended for cardiac use that is external to the body. No additional attributes such as purpose (monitoring, pacing, defibrillation), timing, or laterality are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This wording precisely matches SCTID 765054000 'External cardiac electrode (physical object)'. Using a broader parent like 'Cardiac electrode' would lose the explicit external specification, and more specific children (e.g., ECG electrode, defibrillation pads, pacing electrodes) are not appropriate because the entry does not specify those functions. The term is the FSN synonym and is clinically equivalent to the concept name."
20426007,Volume history of lung (observable entity),Lung volume history signal,"Referring to the 'signal' conveys the continuous volume history captured over time for the lung. Category: Observable entity. This does not introduce device specificity or interpretation, and it remains focused on volume rather than flow or pressure, avoiding sibling concepts. It is not a static measurement, so SCTID 20426007 is the correct code."
773447000,Forensic psychiatry care plan (record artifact),Forensic psychiatry plan of care document,"The entry specifies a plan of care document for forensic psychiatry, a Record artifact. 'Plan of care' and 'care plan' are clinically synonymous in documentation; therefore this maps to Forensic psychiatry care plan (record artifact) SCTID 773447000. Parent Care plan (record artifact) is too general; siblings like mental health care plan or psychiatry care plan without the forensic subtype are less exact. This does not introduce timing, legal status, or other attributes."
26001000087108,Developmental pediatric specialty (qualifier value),Area of specialty: developmental pediatrics,"The phrase identifies the area of specialty without adding service or occupational semantics, and clearly names developmental pediatrics. The main concept is the specialty qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It does not introduce actions or organizational details, maintaining unique mapping to the specialty. Broader parent concepts are insufficiently specific, and child/sibling service or occupation concepts would be inappropriate. The wording is an acceptable synonym that does not change the code."
473077006,Allergy to teriparatide (finding),Medication allergy—teriparatide,"The phrase denotes a medication allergy, specifying teriparatide, without extra qualifiers like severity or reaction type. This is a Clinical finding and corresponds to Allergy to teriparatide (finding), SCTID 473077006. Naming the exact drug makes it more precise than parent concepts such as “Drug allergy.” It does not imply a non-allergic adverse event or intolerance, which would belong to sibling concepts. The wording is a semantically equivalent synonym for the preferred term, supporting the same code."
271623001,Chest movement unequal (finding),Chest wall movement asymmetry,"This entry indicates that the chest wall moves asymmetrically with respiration—the essence of unequal chest movement. It is a Clinical finding and maps most precisely to Chest movement unequal (finding), SCTID 271623001. ""Asymmetry"" is clinically equivalent to ""unequal"" and does not specify side, degree, timing, or cause. Parent concepts like abnormal chest wall movement are overly broad, while siblings like paradoxical movement are not implied."
1269307001,Structure of wall of radial artery (body structure),Arterial wall—radial artery,"This entry identifies the arterial wall associated with the radial artery, with no additional attributes such as layer, laterality, or disease. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It is a precise match for 'Structure of wall of radial artery' because it specifies the wall of that particular artery. Parent terms covering the entire radial artery would be less accurate, and child terms with layer or side detail are not stated. Sibling walls of other arteries are not referenced."
217860008,"Accident caused by a crowd, by collective fear or panic (event)",Follow-up note: accident due to collective panic among a crowd,"The follow-up documentation states the accident was due to collective panic among a crowd, explicitly matching the collective fear/panic mechanism. Main concept: accident caused by crowd panic. Category: Event. SCTID 217860008 is the most precise code since the accident is linked to crowd panic. Parents like unspecified accident or crowd event are less accurate, and children/siblings such as crush or stampede are not indicated. The follow-up context does not introduce added attributes."
407361009,Genus Lagovirus (organism),Viral genus Lagovirus,"This entry identifies Lagovirus as a viral genus, indicating taxonomy without implying infection or detection. It belongs to the Organism hierarchy, matching Genus Lagovirus (organism) [407361009]. A parent family or sibling genera would not match the stated genus, and species-level viruses would be overly specific. The phrase is a direct synonym expressing the same concept."
722934009,Neonatal difficulty in feeding at breast (finding),History: mother reports newborn has difficulty feeding at the breast,"This patient-reported history states the newborn has difficulty feeding at the breast, i.e., neonatal breastfeeding difficulty. It’s a Clinical finding and maps to SCTID 722934009. The statement does not introduce cause, severity, or outcomes, avoiding mapping to child concepts like poor latch or refusal. Parent concepts lacking neonatal specificity would be less accurate, and maternal problems are not implicated by the wording."
214576004,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving fire starting in motor vehicle while in motion, rider of animal or occupant of animal-drawn vehicle injured (event)",Animal-drawn wagon occupant injured in a noncollision road traffic accident involving a motor vehicle fire that began while the vehicle was in motion.,"All defining elements are present: traffic accident, noncollision, fire originating in a motor vehicle while moving, and the injured party is an occupant of an animal-drawn vehicle (wagon). This is a direct fit to SCTID 214576004 (Event). Broader parents or siblings for alternative victim roles (e.g., pedestrian) or collision events are not appropriate. 'Animal-drawn wagon' is an accepted form of animal-drawn vehicle and does not change the coding."
277971006,Extracorporeal circuit equipment (physical object),Extracorporeal circuit equipment mentioned by patient,"Main concept: extracorporeal circuit equipment; 'mentioned by patient' is a context of reporting and does not modify the object. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The term still denotes the equipment used in extracorporeal circuits, fitting SCTID 277971006. Absence of component or therapy details prevents mapping to children/siblings; choosing a parent device concept would lose the circuit-specific precision."
412823000,Percentage rapid progressive spermatozoa (observable entity),Percentage fast progressive spermatozoa,"This phrasing uses 'fast progressive' as a clinically acceptable synonym for rapid progressive spermatozoa and specifies the percentage. The concept is an Observable entity. No numeric result, timeframe, or interpretation is present, so the entry remains a property name. SNOMED CT 412823000 is the best match because it denotes the percentage rapid progressive spermatozoa. Parent or sibling concepts covering broader or different motility categories would be less accurate. The synonym 'fast progressive' does not alter the intended observable attribute."
288942001,Unable to swallow food (finding),Unable to swallow food,"The main concept stated is an absolute inability to swallow food, with the explicit object being food. This is a Clinical finding and matches SNOMED CT concept Unable to swallow food (finding), SCTID 288942001, which specifically captures failure to swallow food rather than generalized swallowing difficulty. Broader parents like Swallowing problem or Unable to swallow (any material) would be less precise, and siblings such as Unable to swallow liquids or dysphagia (difficulty, not inability) do not fit the wording. The phrasing directly reflects the concept without adding timing, cause, or severity."
264210003,Structure of subfrontal extradural space (body structure),Reference structure—subfrontal epidural space,"The entry designates the subfrontal epidural/extradural space as the referenced anatomical structure, with no additional clinical or procedural detail. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and the most precise match is Structure of subfrontal extradural space (SCTID 264210003). Parent terms are too broad, and sibling concepts such as subfrontal subdural space or extradural spaces in different regions would not correctly represent this specific anatomy."
349994006,Product containing xanthine (product),Xanthine medicine product,"This entry denotes a medicine (product) with xanthine as the ingredient. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). It fits SCTID 349994006 because it aligns with the class of products containing xanthine and avoids added attributes such as dose or route. Parents like generic medicinal product are too broad, and children/siblings with specific formulations or different ingredients would be misaligned. 'Medicine product' is a clinically safe paraphrase of medicinal product."
1003640003,History of past procedure section (record artifact),Radiology report: Past procedures section,"This indicates a section within a radiology report that documents past procedures, with 'section' confirming the record artifact nature. Main concept: section for historical procedures in an imaging report. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 1003640003 is the exact match for a 'History of past procedure' section regardless of report type. Sibling concepts like 'Procedure section' that includes current procedures would be broader and less accurate. No additional attributes are given."
121269009,Deuteroporphyrin measurement (procedure),Deuteroporphyrin level assessed,"The entry indicates that the level of deuteroporphyrin was assessed, which in laboratory terms denotes a measurement. No additional attributes such as specimen or results are present. As a Procedure, this is best coded to SCTID 121269009. Parent concepts that cover porphyrin assessments in general are too broad, and sibling concepts focusing on other porphyrins or non-quantitative detection do not match. ""Assessed"" in this context is a clinically equivalent synonym to measured/quantified."
234928001,Removal of foreign body from cheek (procedure),"Operative note: foreign body removal, cheek","The operative note context lists a foreign body removal with cheek as the site, without adding technique or laterality. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This is equivalent to 'Removal of foreign body from cheek,' supporting SCTID 234928001. Parent concepts are too general and cheek substructure-specific concepts are not implied by the entry."
411768001,Psidium guajava diagnostic allergen extract (product),Include Psidium guajava diagnostic allergen extract in the allergen series,"This instruction identifies the diagnostic allergen extract from Psidium guajava, adding no details about therapeutic intent, component specificity, or formulation. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 411768001 is the correct match since it represents that exact diagnostic allergen extract. Parent concepts omit the species detail, and sibling or child concepts with therapeutic roles or particular fractions are not indicated by the wording."
5531000179105,Nursing report (record artifact),Report authored by nursing,"Authorship by nursing is the defining feature here, directly corresponding to a nursing report artifact. No additional attributes such as event type, content, or time are included. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Nursing report (record artifact) SCTID 5531000179105 is the precise match. More general record artifact codes do not capture the nursing authorship, and specific variants like discharge nursing report would be overly narrow and add context not stated."
440134001,Product manufactured as vaginal dose form (product),Vaginal dose-form medicinal product,"This states a medicinal product whose dose form is vaginal, aligning with a product classified by its dosage form. SNOMED CT category: Product. It maps to SCTID 440134001 because it captures the same attribute—manufactured as a vaginal dose form—without specifying a particular subtype or active ingredient. Parent concepts are too broad (not dose-form specific), and sibling/child concepts (e.g., vaginal cream product or vaginal tablet product) are more specific than this general vaginal dose-form class. 'Medicinal product' is a accepted synonym for pharmaceutical product and does not change code selection."
736369006,Day case care plan (record artifact),Care plan for day case,"This entry conveys that the artifact is a care plan specifically designed for a day case episode. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the best-fitting concept is Day case care plan (record artifact), SCTID 736369006. Parent 'Care plan' lacks the day-case qualifier, and siblings like Inpatient care plan or Discharge plan are contextually different. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase that retains the same meaning and scope."
244896007,Entire sixth internal intercostal muscle (body structure),Anatomic focus: 6th internal intercostal muscle,"The phrase identifies the sixth internal intercostal muscle as the anatomical focus, which is a Body structure. SCTID 244896007 is the correct code for the entire sixth segment of the internal intercostals. The numerical shorthand does not alter meaning. More general internal intercostal muscle concepts or other intercostal muscle types (external/innermost) would be imprecise, and no additional attributes are present."
215227000,Fall from animal-drawn vehicle (event),Fell off horse-drawn carriage,"This entry specifies a fall from a carriage that is drawn by a horse, which is a type of animal-drawn vehicle. The concept is an Event, and Fall from animal-drawn vehicle (event) [215227000] is the most precise match because the vehicle type is explicitly animal-drawn. More general parents such as Fall from vehicle (event) are too broad, and a sibling like Fall from horse (event) would be inaccurate because a horse itself is not a vehicle. The phrase “fell off” is a clinically equivalent way to express a fall and does not add further attributes."
87311002,"Gastric mucosal barrier, function (observable entity)",Gastric mucosal barrier function,"The entry explicitly names the functional property of the stomach’s mucosal barrier, which is an observable parameter rather than a finding or structure. No value, abnormality, cause, or timing is stated. In SNOMED CT, this is an Observable entity, and the most precise match is “Gastric mucosal barrier, function (observable entity)” SCTID 87311002. A parent like a more general mucosal barrier function or a sibling such as gastric mucosal integrity would be broader or different in property, and a child such as impaired gastric mucosal barrier function would add a state not present here."
441445002,Solirubrobacter pauli (organism),Genus and species: Solirubrobacter pauli,"This wording denotes binomial nomenclature, where the genus Solirubrobacter and species epithet pauli are combined as the species name. The main concept is the organism Solirubrobacter pauli, with no additional clinical information. This aligns with the Organism category in SNOMED CT and maps specifically to Solirubrobacter pauli (organism) [441445002]. A parent concept like Solirubrobacter (genus) would be too coarse, and other species within the genus would be siblings, not matches. The phrase clarifies rank without changing the target concept."
242895005,Head butt (event),Follow-up mention: head-butt,"The follow-up context label does not alter the core concept; “head-butt” denotes the event mechanism. Category: Event. No explicit timing, outcome, or intent is introduced beyond acknowledging the event, so SCTID 242895005 is the precise match. Parent event concepts are too general, and children implying injury or different mechanisms do not fit."
1237082000,Replantation of tooth planned (situation),Tooth replantation planned.,"This entry conveys that a tooth replantation procedure is intended but not yet performed. The attribute is planning/intent, fitting the Situation category in SNOMED CT. It maps most precisely to “Replantation of tooth planned (situation)” SCTID 1237082000. Using the synonym phrase order “Tooth replantation” instead of “Replantation of tooth” is clinically equivalent and does not change the meaning or require a different code. Parent concepts (e.g., generic procedure planned) are too broad, and any procedure-performed concepts or other dental procedures would be inappropriate."
698792001,Brightfield illumination (qualifier value),Brightfield illumination applied,"The phrase denotes that the brightfield illumination technique is used, corresponding directly to Brightfield illumination (qualifier value), SCTID 698792001. The main concept is the method of illumination; the entry does not introduce added attributes such as specimen type, stain, objective, or timing beyond use. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value because it expresses a method modifier rather than a distinct procedure or device. A parent concept (unspecified illumination) would lack specificity, and siblings (darkfield or phase contrast illumination) would not match the stated technique. Thus, the qualifier value for brightfield illumination is the most accurate coding."
413323004,Refugee family (social concept),Social history: refugee family,"This entry places the family-level refugee status within social history documentation, still expressing only the social concept. It fits SNOMED CT’s Social concept category and maps to Refugee family (social concept) [413323004]. It does not suggest an individual refugee code, nor any other social factor like homelessness or migration, so parent or sibling concepts would be less precise. The placement in social history does not alter the concept."
464330004,"Ostomy base plate, flat (physical object)",Clinic materials: flat ostomy barrier plate,"Clinic materials label the item as a flat ostomy barrier plate, synonymous with base plate. This falls under Physical object and matches SNOMED CT 464330004. No additional features are implied, making parent concepts too general and siblings (e.g., convex) incorrect."
299774008,Tonic neck reflex present (finding),Tonic neck reflex observed,"The entry indicates that the tonic neck reflex was observed, which is synonymous with being present. This is a Clinical finding and aligns precisely with SCTID 299774008. No details about subtype, laterality, severity, or timing are provided, preventing drift to child or sibling concepts. 'Observed' is an equivalent clinical phrasing to 'present' and does not change the appropriate code."
713031009,History of chronic dissection of thoracic aorta (situation),Patient reports a history of chronic thoracic aortic dissection.,"This patient-reported statement clearly indicates a personal medical history and specifies chronic dissection of the thoracic aorta. The main elements are the history-of context, chronicity, and thoracic aortic dissection. Category: Situation with explicit context. SCTID 713031009 fits best because it exactly encodes a history of chronic thoracic aortic dissection. A current finding/disorder code would be inappropriate due to the explicit history framing, and concepts for non-thoracic aorta or acute dissection do not match. The patient-report context does not change the clinical meaning or code selection."
223388009,Lanzarote (geographic location),Study site: Lanzarote,"This research documentation identifies Lanzarote as the study site, focusing on a single geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Location (geographic location). The correct code is Lanzarote (geographic location), SCTID 223388009. Broader or different locations would not represent the same site. The label 'study site' is context and does not alter the underlying place concept."
108716007,Eflornithine hydrochloride (substance),DFMO hydrochloride,"DFMO is a widely used synonym for eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine); adding 'hydrochloride' clearly indicates the salt form. This remains a Substance concept and aligns with SCTID 108716007. The synonym does not change the coded meaning, as DFMO refers to eflornithine. Parent concepts like the base eflornithine lack the salt specification, and sibling medicinal product or formulation concepts are not appropriate because no route, strength, or dosage is stated."
223692008,El Salvador (geographic location),Address country: El Salvador,"This is a field-style entry specifying El Salvador as the country, with the only concept being the geographic entity itself. In SNOMED CT, it maps to the Geographic location category. SCTID 223692008 is the precise code for El Salvador. A parent concept like Country would be less specific, and neither a child location nor a sibling country matches the named nation."
440132002,Product manufactured as parenteral dose form (product),Dispensing record: parenteral dose form product,"The entry states the product is a parenteral dose form within a dispensing context, with no mention of particular parenteral type, strength, or ingredient. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 440132002 is the correct, specific code because the manufactured dose form is parenteral, expressed generally. Choosing a parent concept would lose the dose-form specificity, and selecting a child concept would require a specified formulation (e.g., solution for injection) that is not present. The dispensing context does not alter the core product classification."
77665000,Ventrohysteropexy (procedure),Uterine fixation to abdominal wall (ventral),"By specifying uterine fixation to the abdominal wall and clarifying ventral, this text maps to ventrohysteropexy. The main concept is a surgical Procedure. SNOMED CT 77665000 is appropriate because the anchor site is the anterior abdominal wall. Parent hysteropexy lacks the site, and other site-specific siblings (e.g., sacral) are excluded. The wording does not add timing, technique, or indication."
1286759003,Presence of metastatic discontinuous spread of malignant neoplasm of cecum and/or colon and/or rectum to pericolic tissue (observable entity),Imaging impression: discontinuous metastatic spread to pericolic tissue from colorectal cancer is present.,"The entry asserts presence of discontinuous metastasis to pericolic tissue in the context of colorectal cancer, framed as an imaging impression. This remains an Observable entity of presence. It matches SCTID 1286759003 because it specifies the colorectal origin, pericolic site, and discontinuous pattern. Concepts for general metastasis or other locations would be less precise. The imaging context does not introduce additional attributes; it simply varies the documentation setting."
702261009,Gas chromatography analyzer detector (physical object),Gas chromatography analyzer detector,"The main concept is the detector component of a gas chromatography analyzer. This is a Physical object (Device) in SNOMED CT. The wording explicitly names the detector and ties it to a gas chromatography analyzer, which makes SCTID 702261009 the most precise match. It is not the entire gas chromatography analyzer (parent device) nor a specific detector type (e.g., flame ionization or electron capture), so children or siblings are less appropriate. The entry contains no additional attributes beyond the device identity."
346532000,Intravenous nutrition - amino acids (product),Supply: IV nutrition amino acids,"The phrase describes a supply item for IV nutrition with amino acids as the nutrient, indicating a product. This is Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). SCTID 346532000 fits because it specifies intravenous nutrition with amino acids and no other components. It excludes broader PN or TPN and avoids procedure notions. The supply context does not introduce concentration, brand, or dose, keeping the mapping to the exact product concept."
328717006,Gluten-free pasta anellini (product),Pantry stock: gluten-free pasta anellini,"The entry identifies a stocked item that is the product “gluten-free pasta anellini.” The concept type is Product and the attributes are gluten-free and anellini pasta, exactly matching SCTID 328717006. It avoids collapsing to the parent category of gluten-free pasta by retaining the anellini shape, and it introduces no shape substitutions or brand details that would imply siblings or children."
223873009,Derbyshire (geographic location),Derbyshire (county),"This entry clarifies the type of location by appending '(county)' to 'Derbyshire', which maps directly to SNOMED CT 223873009 Derbyshire (geographic location). It introduces no additional attributes such as timeframe, status, or relationship to a patient. The category is Geographic location (Location). It excludes broader parents like England/UK and narrower siblings like specific towns or districts. The synonymic qualifier '(county)' maintains the same concept and supports precise code selection."
218047001,Accident caused by needle (event),Event: accident attributed to needle,"The entry labels this as an event and specifies the accident is attributed to a needle, which directly corresponds to 'Accident caused by needle (event)' SCTID 218047001. No injury, anatomical, or procedural attributes are included, so narrower clinical finding or complication codes are not justified. 'Attributed to' is a causal synonym and does not alter the concept. Broader accident events lack the stated needle cause, and child concepts specifying needle types are not supported by the text."
773430001,Obstetric care plan (record artifact),Obstetric care plan discussed with patient,"The phrase indicates that the documented obstetric care plan exists and was discussed; the core concept is the plan artifact itself. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This aligns with “Obstetric care plan (record artifact)” because the subject is the documented plan, not a care procedure or condition. A general care plan discussion would be less specific, and antenatal-only or birth-only plan discussions would be narrower alternatives. The entry preserves equivalence without introducing cause, severity, or timing."
416358008,Cancer shared care medication card (record artifact),Cancer shared-care medication card on file,"The entry denotes that the specific artifact—a cancer shared-care medication card—is present in the record. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The phrase contains the full conceptual scope: cancer, shared care, and medication card, exactly aligning with SCTID 416358008. The contextual phrase “on file” does not change the artifact being referenced. A parent concept like record artifact would be too general, and sibling artifacts such as generic shared care cards without the cancer focus would be less precise."
5041003,"Adhesive strip, device (physical object)",Adhesive strip,"This entry names the object succinctly as an adhesive strip, which in clinical documentation denotes the device form factor of a strip with adhesive. It fits the Physical object (Device) category and corresponds to SCTID 5041003. It does not imply tape (a roll) or a wound-specific closure strip, nor does it imply a padded bandage; thus, child or sibling concepts like Adhesive tape or Adhesive bandage are less appropriate. The omission of the word 'device' does not alter the concept; it remains the same device."
227388008,Cinnamon (substance),Nutrition note includes: cinnamon,"The entry indicates that cinnamon is included in a nutrition note, but the context does not specify preparation, species, dose, or related conditions. The primary concept is cinnamon as a material, categorized in SNOMED CT as a Substance, best represented by Cinnamon (substance) [227388008]. Mapping to broader parents (e.g., food substances) would lose specificity, and mapping to specific children like cinnamon extract or ground cinnamon would add unstated attributes. The mention remains the pure substance."
781405001,Medicinal product package (product),Packaged medicinal product,"This phrase is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term, indicating a medicinal product in its package without specifying any other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The wording aligns precisely with 781405001 Medicinal product package (product). A parent concept like Medicinal product would lack the packaging dimension, whereas children naming specific substances, strengths, or pack sizes would add detail not present here. Siblings such as Medicinal product form (dose form) or container-only physical object concepts are not appropriate because the entry centers on the packaged product entity."
423100009,Results section (record artifact),Section: Results,"The phrase “Section: Results” denotes the labeled portion of a clinical document dedicated to results. This is a Record artifact rather than a clinical finding or test outcome. The exact match is Results section (record artifact) [423100009], as it specifies a section title and not the content of the results themselves. Using “Section: Results” is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of “Results section,” without implying any parent section type or child section subtype. It does not introduce attributes such as laboratory versus imaging, status, or content details, ensuring precise mapping."
328433005,Lorenzo's oil liquid (product),Dispense record: Lorenzo's oil liquid,"The text refers to a record of dispensing but the coded content remains the product Lorenzo's oil liquid. The main concept is a Product in SNOMED CT, mapping to SCTID 328433005. There is no inclusion of dose, route, or indication. A parent concept lacking the liquid form would be insufficiently specific, while a sibling specifying another dose form would be wrong. The 'dispense record' context does not modify the product concept."
392429002,Horse dander specific immunoglobulin E antibody measurement (procedure),Specific IgE to horse dander,"This phrasing identifies the same procedure: measuring allergen-specific immunoglobulin E for horse dander. The main concept is an IgE antibody measurement targeted to a single allergen, horse dander. Category: Procedure. It does not broaden to a panel or to a different antibody class (e.g., IgG), and it avoids suggesting skin testing. The wording matches SNOMED CT 392429002 more precisely than parent concepts that omit the allergen and than sibling concepts for other animal danders. The synonym “specific IgE” is standard and clinically equivalent to the preferred term without adding new attributes."
450348001,Biopsy of lesion of lung (procedure),Lung lesion biopsy carried out,"This statement indicates that a biopsy was carried out on a lung lesion. The core concept is a Procedure with a specified target (lesion in the lung). The best match is SNOMED CT 450348001, biopsy of lesion of lung. The entry avoids approach, guidance, or laterality, preventing misclassification to more specific children, and it remains more precise than a generic lung biopsy parent concept because of the lesion focus."
764815005,Psychologically prepared to undergo surgery (finding),Patient is mentally ready to proceed with surgery,"This documentation indicates mental readiness to proceed with surgery, aligning with psychological preparedness. The main concept is the patient's psychological readiness; the wording 'to proceed' stays within the scope of readiness without implying consent or scheduling. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. 'Mentally ready' is a synonym of 'psychologically prepared,' so SCTID 764815005 is the precise match, not a broader parent or sibling such as physical readiness or consent status."
429050006,History of malignant neoplasm of skin (situation),History of cancer of skin,"This statement reflects a historical condition of cancer involving the skin, i.e., a past malignant neoplasm of the skin. Category: Situation with explicit context. The entry avoids specifying histology, location within the skin, or other attributes, so mapping to subtype children (melanoma, BCC, SCC) would be inappropriate. It is more specific than a general 'history of cancer' because the site is specified. SNOMED CT 429050006 is appropriate."
185816000,Well man monitoring default (finding),Patient defaulted from well man monitoring,"This is a Clinical finding documenting that the patient defaulted from well man monitoring. The specific SNOMED CT concept SCTID 185816000 is the precise fit because it ties the default to the well man monitoring program. Parent concepts like generic monitoring default lack the program specificity, and sibling codes for different programs or refusal would be inaccurate. The inclusion of “patient” does not add attributes beyond identifying the subject and maintains the same semantics."
390981004,Seminal fructose level (procedure),Follow-up note: seminal fructose level reviewed,"In follow-up context, the focus remains the specific test that determined fructose level in semen; ‘reviewed’ reflects clinical workflow but does not change the procedure being referenced. Category: Procedure. SCTID 390981004 is appropriate, as the underlying concept is the seminal fructose level measurement. Coding to a general ‘review of results’ artifact would lose the specificity of the actual procedure; parent or sibling concepts (e.g., full semen analysis) are broader than intended. No method or result is stated."
405079000,Health promotion behavior (observable entity),Health promotion behavior,"The entry states the exact concept 'health promotion behavior' without any qualifiers, modalities, timing, or extent. The main medical concept is a person's behavior that promotes health. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Observable entity, as it represents an observed or reportable behavior rather than a disorder or procedure. The most precise match is Health promotion behavior (observable entity) because the wording exactly matches the preferred term. Broader parent concepts like health-related behavior would be less specific, and child or sibling concepts that name particular behaviors (e.g., exercise behavior, dietary behavior, risk-taking behavior) are not specified and thus less appropriate."
16848541000119108,History of primary malignant neoplasm of right main bronchus (situation),"Previous diagnosis: primary malignant neoplasm, right mainstem bronchus","“Previous diagnosis” signals a historical situation. The malignant neoplasm is primary and situated in the right mainstem bronchus (synonym for main bronchus). This fits the SNOMED Situation concept precisely. Parent terms without laterality or site specificity would be too general, and siblings involving left or unspecified bronchus or secondary neoplasms would be incorrect. The synonyms used do not change the clinical meaning or code selection."
706964007,Response to treatment shows pulse decreased (situation),Documented: pulse decreased due to treatment effect.,"The statement records that the decrease in pulse is due to the effect of treatment, i.e., a response to therapy. Attributes present are the treatment-response context and decreased pulse direction; no extra details are introduced. This maps to the Situation hierarchy, SCTID 706964007. Coding as a generic adverse effect or as a standalone decreased pulse finding would misrepresent the context; nothing indicates harm or abnormality beyond the response. Sibling concepts with different directionality or different physiologic measures are not indicated. 'Due to treatment effect' is synonymous with 'response to treatment' in context."
260413007,None (qualifier value),None to report,"“None to report” communicates that the reportable value is none, without adding any attribute details. The concept is a Qualifier value indicating absence/zero and maps to None (qualifier value) [260413007]. It is not equivalent to ‘Unknown,’ ‘Not applicable,’ or ‘Negative,’ as no uncertainty, irrelevance, or test result is implied. The phrasing is a patient or clinician contextual paraphrase that remains semantically ‘none.’"
223680008,Spain (geographic location),Travel history includes Spain,"This entry references Spain within a travel history context, but the coded concept is solely the geographic location Spain. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). There are no added attributes that narrow or broaden the location; it does not specify parts of Spain or alternate places. SCTID 223680008 is the precise match; parent classes are too general, and child or sibling locations are not named."
118144006,Screening test for red cell enzyme deficiency (procedure),Hematology screening test for RBC enzyme deficiency,"Main concept: hematology screening test targeting RBC enzyme deficiency; 'hematology' indicates domain without adding method or specificity. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This maps to 118144006 as a red cell enzyme deficiency screen. A generic parent like 'hematology screening' would be too broad, and child concepts for specific enzyme deficiency screens would be over-specified. It avoids diagnostic assay terminology, keeping it within the screening procedure scope."
285402002,Vapor pressure (physical force),Vapor pressure noted,"Although phrased as a documentation remark, the sole technical concept present is vapor pressure, a Physical force. No additional attributes such as measurement values, temperature, or specific material are mentioned; therefore, Vapor pressure (physical force) [285402002] remains the most precise code. Coding to a parent Physical force would lose specificity, and siblings (e.g., Gas pressure) are not appropriate. The context word “noted” does not alter the concept; it simply indicates mention in documentation."
223815009,Waterford (geographic location),Residence: Waterford.,"The entry lists Waterford as a residence; the coded place remains the geographic location “Waterford.” SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The specific concept Waterford (geographic location) SCTID 223815009 is appropriate because the text names a particular place without adding qualifiers (no county, state, or hospital). A parent concept would be overly broad, and a child/sibling like County Waterford or a facility in Waterford would be incorrect given the absence of those qualifiers. “Residence” is contextual and does not change the location entity."
58517005,Structure of fetal lower extremities (body structure),"Lower extremities of the fetus, body structure","This entry identifies the entity as the fetus’s lower extremities and explicitly labels it as a body structure, which corresponds to the SNOMED CT Body structure concept SCTID 58517005. It contains no added attributes such as laterality, findings, or procedural actions. A non-fetal lower extremity structure would be too general, and a specific component (e.g., fetal foot) would be too narrow. The phrasing is a semantically equivalent representation of the same anatomical concept."
1222764006,American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I:25 (qualifier value),Per AJCC staging: Stage I,"The phrase indicates that, according to the AJCC staging system, the stage is I, with no substage, site, or modality specified. The main concept is AJCC Stage I. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value and precisely matches American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I:25 (qualifier value). Selecting a generic parent like Stage I would not reflect the AJCC framework; child concepts such as IA/IB are not warranted here. Sibling concepts (TNM Stage I or clinical/pathologic AJCC Stage I) introduce additional attributes. The wording is a standard, semantically equivalent way to denote the AJCC Stage I qualifier."
223545002,Namibia (geographic location),Namibia specified in chart,"‘Namibia’ is specified within the chart, and the only substantive concept is the geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location), and SCTID 223545002 corresponds to Namibia. No additional attributes (timing, cause, demographic status) are included. Broader parents or other geographic entities would not be as precise. The wording serves as context for documentation and does not change the intended code selection."
705434002,Activities-of-daily-living-training assistive device (physical object),Occupational therapy ADL training assistive device,"This describes an assistive device for ADL training within the typical occupational therapy domain, which is consistent context rather than a new attribute of the object. No usage or provisioning action is stated. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 705434002 is the most precise code since it encodes assistive devices used to train ADLs. Using a general assistive device parent or an ADL device without training would be less accurate. Mentioning “occupational therapy” reflects common use and does not alter the device concept."
171463005,Open biopsy of lesion of frontal lobe of brain (procedure),Open brain biopsy focused on a frontal lobe lesion,"This entry describes an open brain biopsy with the target localized to the frontal lobe lesion. Category: Procedure. The wording is a paraphrase that preserves both the open approach and precise site, aligning with 'Open biopsy of lesion of frontal lobe of brain' (SCTID 171463005). It excludes other lobes, needle or stereotactic techniques, and tumor-specific codes, making this concept the most accurate match."
218026000,Accidents caused by powered household appliances and implements (event),Indication: accident with powered household appliances and implements,"As an imaging or diagnostic indication, this entry conveys that the exam is prompted by an accident due to powered household appliances and implements, mapping directly to SCTID 218026000. Category: Event. There are no added attributes such as injury characteristics or timing beyond the causal event. A parent accidental event code would be insufficiently specific, and siblings like non-powered appliances would be incorrect. The phrasing is equivalent and supports the same code."
353355004,Gluten-free cookies (product),Packed gluten-free cookies,"This entry indicates the product gluten-free cookies being packed, without specifying packaging type or quantity. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 353355004 is the most precise match. The verb ‘packed’ adds context but not product attributes. Parent concepts like generic gluten-free food are too general, and sibling cookies without gluten-free specification are not consistent with the wording."
224066008,Massachusetts (geographic location),State of Massachusetts,"The phrase identifies Massachusetts specifically as a U.S. state, which is simply clarifying the same geographic entity. The main concept is the location Massachusetts with no extra clinical attributes. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location), matched to Massachusetts (geographic location) [224066008]. Referring to it as a ‘state’ does not change the concept, and broader locations (e.g., United States) or different jurisdictions are not implied."
364074009,Regularity of heart rhythm (observable entity),Review of heart rhythm regularity,"The phrase denotes reviewing the attribute ‘heart rhythm regularity’ without outcome specification. It is an Observable entity. The most precise code is Regularity of heart rhythm (observable entity), SCTID 364074009, as it captures the regularity property of cardiac rhythm. Parent concepts are too general; pulse-focused observables are siblings and not cardiac rhythm; and findings like ‘regular rhythm’/‘irregular rhythm’ introduce values. Contextual wording (‘review’) does not change the observable."
452201000124102,Probable (qualifier value),Pathology comment: probable,"This text applies the qualifier “probable” in a pathology comment, with no other attributes or conditions specified. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The best match is Probable (qualifier value) [452201000124102], as it encodes the exact likelihood qualifier. Parent concepts of generic certainty would be overly broad, and sibling qualifiers like suspected or definite convey different certainty degrees. The pathology context does not introduce additional semantic attributes."
444831002,Machine hemodialysate specimen obtained after mixing (specimen),Patient reports: sample of the hemodialysis machine fluid was taken after mixing,"A patient-reported phrasing identifies a sample of fluid from a hemodialysis machine and specifies that it was taken after mixing, which is clinically equivalent to a mixed machine hemodialysate specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The reference to hemodialysis machine fluid makes it clear this is hemodialysate, not peritoneal dialysate, and the after-mixing qualifier points to SCTID 444831002. No other attributes are introduced that would take it to a parent or sibling concept."
107291000,Family Viperidae (organism),Viperidae family (organism),"This entry explicitly identifies the organism taxonomic family Viperidae. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. By specifying 'family' and the name Viperidae, it aligns exactly with the Family Viperidae concept and avoids attributes like exposure or envenomation. Parent groups such as reptiles or snakes are broader, and species/genus-level vipers are narrower. 'Organism' clarifies the taxonomic intent without changing code selection."
735329003,Vascular surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient vascular surgical plan of care,"The phrase uses 'vascular surgical' as a synonym for 'vascular surgery' and 'plan of care' as a synonym for 'care plan,' together indicating an inpatient care plan artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and SCTID 735329003 is the best match. Parent codes lack the specialty and setting specificity, and sibling concepts for outpatient care plans or non-vascular surgical plans are not applicable. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent and do not change the code selection."
235561000112100,Neuroendocrine neoplasm suspected (situation),Assessment: neuroendocrine neoplasm suspected.,"In the assessment section, the clinician documents suspicion of a neuroendocrine neoplasm, without asserting confirmation or specifying site/behavior. This is a Situation with explicit context and is most precisely coded as “Neuroendocrine neoplasm suspected (situation)” 235561000112100. Parent concepts like “neoplasm suspected” fail to capture the neuroendocrine nature, and child concepts (e.g., suspected neuroendocrine carcinoma) introduce a subtype not mentioned. The wording is a direct statement of suspicion and does not alter the code."
64004006,Conflagration (physical force),Imaging caption: Conflagration,"Using ‘Conflagration’ as an imaging caption labels the depicted physical-force event without introducing other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 64004006 is the precise coding target for the concept of conflagration. Using a broader fire concept would be less specific, and no subtype (e.g., forest or structural fire) is indicated. The context (caption) does not alter the underlying concept or add clinical attributes."
3981000181102,Lederbergia graminis (organism),Microbiology organism name: Lederbergia graminis,"This line presents the species Lederbergia graminis as an organism name in a microbiology context without asserting presence or disease. It belongs to the Organism category in SNOMED CT and maps to Lederbergia graminis (organism), SCTID 3981000181102. The contextual label 'Microbiology organism name' does not introduce new attributes such as causative role or site. Using broader parent taxonomy or sibling species would be less precise given the explicit species. No finding or disorder concepts are appropriate because the entry does not claim patient-level presence or pathology."
1287812009,Hailstorm (event),Hailstorm,"The entry denotes the specific weather event of a hailstorm without any added attributes such as time, location, or severity. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Event hierarchy, and the most precise code is Hailstorm (event) [1287812009]. Broader parent concepts like Storm (event) or Weather event would be less specific, and sibling concepts like Thunderstorm or Snowstorm describe different phenomena. No causal or exposure context is introduced, so it remains coded as the event itself."
430248009,Specimen from nasopharyngeal structure (specimen),Nasopharynx specimen collected,This note indicates a specimen was collected and its source is the nasopharynx. Category: Specimen. The correct code is 430248009 because it reflects specimens from the nasopharyngeal structure without extra attributes. More specific children like nasopharyngeal swab specimen are not appropriate because the method is not stated; broader parents are too general. The phrasing remains within the same conceptual boundaries.
702270007,Bilirubinometer (physical object),Bilirubin measurement instrument,"The wording identifies an instrument for measuring bilirubin, i.e., a bilirubinometer. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This maps to SCTID 702270007 since it describes the exact device class and avoids specifying subtypes like transcutaneous or laboratory analyzer platforms. Parent categories such as general measurement instruments are too broad, and sibling devices (e.g., spectrophotometer) add technical characteristics not mentioned. The synonym retains the same device meaning."
242625003,Bite of rodent (event),Complaint: rodent bite,"Main concept: patient complaint is a rodent bite event. No attributes like severity, location, timing, or species are added. SNOMED CT category: Event. This maps to SCTID 242625003. A parent such as “animal bite” is overly broad, and any child specifying the rodent type or injury characteristics would not be supported by the text."
223585008,South east Asian country (geographic location),Geographic location: Southeast Asian country,"This entry presents 'Southeast Asian country' as a value under a generic label 'Geographic location,' but the coded content is the country-level entity in Southeast Asia. Category: Geographic location. The value matches SCTID 223585008 precisely. The label does not add attributes that change the concept; it only indicates context. Parent concepts (country) or region-only concepts are less specific, and no child country is named, ensuring correct granularity."
364513001,Size of foot (observable entity),Foot size (observable entity),"Including “(observable entity)” explicitly frames this as a measurable attribute rather than a disorder or finding, which aligns directly with Size of foot (SCTID 364513001). No lateral side, dimension, value, abnormality, method, or time context is added. The term excludes procedure wording (e.g., measurement) and avoids related but distinct siblings like Shoe size or Length of foot. Parent observables such as Size of body system or body structure are overly general and not as precise. The synonym “foot size” is clinically identical to the preferred term and appropriately coded to this observable."
125113004,Normal tissue morphology by gross inspection (finding),Specimen gross assessment shows normal tissue morphology.,"This frames a pathology/specimen context with a gross assessment showing normal tissue morphology, which is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 125113004 matches, as it represents normal morphology determined by gross inspection. A parent concept of normal morphology lacking modality is less precise; microscopy-based siblings would be incorrect. The use of “specimen gross assessment” is a common synonym for gross inspection and is clinically equivalent."
59842000,Nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (substance),Nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase,"The entry explicitly names the enzyme nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase, which is a biochemical substance. In SNOMED CT this maps to the Substance category, and SCTID 59842000 is the precise concept for this specific enzyme. Broader parent concepts like “enzyme” or “transferase” are too generic, and sibling enzymes such as nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) act on a different substrate and would be incorrect. No additional attributes (e.g., organism, isoform, activity level, or clinical finding) are introduced, so the substance concept is the exact match."
1193632009,Cabo Verde (geographic location),Cape Verde,"This entry uses the English synonym Cape Verde for the country known officially as Cabo Verde, representing a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. Cape Verde is a clinically and administratively recognized equivalent name for the same country, so SCTID 1193632009 is the appropriate code. The phrase does not imply a different concept such as the archipelago distinct from the sovereign state, nor does it add context like travel or residence, keeping it specific to the country."
103223006,"Peripolesis, function (observable entity)",Hematology observable—peripolesis function,"Framing peripolesis function as a hematology observable provides domain context but continues to point to the specific observable entity. No result or abnormality is implied, so 103223006 is the correct SNOMED CT code in the Observable entity hierarchy. Broader parents (hematology cell function) would be underspecified, and sibling observables (chemotaxis function) reflect different cell behaviors. The context qualifier is synonymous and does not alter code selection."
114435006,Salmonella IIIb 17:k:z (organism),Taxonomic entry: Salmonella IIIb 17:k:z,Framing as a 'taxonomic entry' still points to the organism Salmonella IIIb 17:k:z and adds no clinical findings or qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This best matches SCTID 114435006 because the IIIb 17:k:z formula is definitive. More general taxonomy (parents) or different serovars (siblings) are not as precise. The context is administrative/identificational and retains the same concept.
242544000,Exposure to radiant heat from open solid fuel fire (event),Exposure to radiant thermal energy from an open peat fire,"The entry describes exposure to radiant thermal energy (radiant heat) from an open peat fire, peat being a solid fuel. This aligns with SNOMED CT Event SCTID 242544000. General heat exposure parents lack the source detail, and sibling concepts regarding flames, burns, or smoke are not appropriate here. “Radiant thermal energy” is a clinically equivalent formulation of radiant heat and preserves the specific coding intent."
216347001,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, factory loading platform (environment)",History: poisoning occurred on the factory loading platform,"The history note identifies the poisoning’s place of occurrence as the factory loading platform, which is precisely the environment concept targeted. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. Mentioning poisoning is within the FSN scope without adding details such as agent or dose. Broader or different location codes would be less appropriate. This corresponds to SCTID 216347001."
229937009,Custard powder (substance),Custard powder item,"Referring to it as an item does not change the concept: it is the substance custard powder. No additional attributes like brand, flavor, or reaction are added. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, matched to Custard powder (substance), SCTID 229937009. More general product or food categories would be less precise for this wording."
399622002,Specimen from thyroid obtained by total thyroidectomy (specimen),Lab request: thyroid specimen (total thyroidectomy),"This lab request-style entry specifies a thyroid specimen and includes the procurement method in parentheses, which still explicitly conveys total thyroidectomy and maps to SNOMED CT 399622002 (Specimen). It does not add attributes like pathology findings or laterality. A broader thyroid specimen code would be less precise due to missing method, and procedure codes or specimens from partial thyroidectomy would be inappropriate. The parentheses formatting does not alter the clinical meaning."
441755002,Product containing peroxisome proliferator-activated alpha receptor agonist (product),Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonist drug product,"This entry identifies a drug product defined by PPAR-α agonist activity, with no mention of specific substance, strength, or route. SNOMED CT category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). SCTID 441755002 is appropriate because it codes for products containing PPAR-α agonists. Broader parent classes (all PPAR agonists) are less precise, and narrower child classes (specific fibrate products) are not indicated. The term “drug product” preserves the product-level focus and does not change the code selection."
264361005,Health center (environment),Care setting: health center,"This communicates that the setting of care is a health center. The main concept is the environment/setting, fitting the Environment or geographical location category. The most specific SNOMED CT code is 264361005 Health center (environment). It does not imply a clinic, hospital, urgent care, or a community-designated center, avoiding sibling or child codes. The phrase remains a semantically equivalent way to denote the health center environment."
703487004,"Anion gap based on sodium, chloride and bicarbonate ions (observable entity)","Follow-up item: review anion gap (Na, Cl, HCO3 method)","The entry asks to review the anion gap calculated by the Na, Cl, HCO3 method, with the calculation basis explicitly stated. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. Even in follow-up context, the observable is the three-ion anion gap, making SCTID 703487004 the most precise code; adding potassium or corrections would shift to sibling concepts. There is no abnormality or order status coded here. The wording is a contextual paraphrase that remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
118428007,"Flexible fiberoptic endoscope, device (physical object)",Flexible fiberoptic scope (endoscope),"The term ‘scope’ is a widely accepted synonym for ‘endoscope,’ and the parenthetical clarifies the device class, with explicit ‘flexible’ and ‘fiberoptic’ characteristics. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). This is more specific than a generic scope/endoscope and does not drift into child concepts (e.g., bronchoscope) or sibling modalities (e.g., video endoscope). It refrains from any procedure or site detail, fitting 118428007 exactly."
1853451000004102,Gleason scoring system for prostatic cancer composite method (staging scale),Gleason composite method classification—prostatic cancer,"The entry denotes the classification system for prostatic cancer as the Gleason composite method, corresponding to the staging scale artifact. SNOMED CT category: Staging scale (assessment scale). It is a reference to the method, not to a particular scored outcome or diagnosis. Parent concepts lacking 'composite' are less specific, and sibling concepts like grade group or individual Gleason score values are excluded, making this code the correct match."
394604002,"Ear, nose and throat surgery (qualifier value)",ENT surgical specialty,"The entry identifies ENT and asserts it is a surgical specialty, which corresponds exactly to the intended qualifier value for ENT surgery. The category is Qualifier value, with 394604002 as the precise code. It does not suggest procedures, consults, or departments, thus avoiding incorrect mapping to procedural or organizational concepts. Parent concepts are too broad and sibling specialties are different domains, making this code the best fit."
468541007,"Diskectomy system, percutaneous, automatic (physical object)",Pre-op note: automatic percutaneous discectomy system on tray,"The entry identifies a specific device/system for discectomy that is automatic and percutaneous, referenced during pre-op preparation. Category: Physical object (Device). The presence of both qualifiers supports mapping to SCTID 468541007. Generic discectomy systems without automation or approach details would be parents and less precise, while manual or non-percutaneous devices would be siblings. The note context does not alter the device concept; it remains a physical object."
66199009,Nitrogen fixation gene (observable entity),Research record: nitrogen fixation gene,"Main concept: a research context notation of the nitrogen fixation gene, presented as the observable target. Category: Observable entity. This corresponds to SCTID 66199009, as it cites the gene class without adding details. A parent-level gene observable would not capture the nitrogen fixation specificity, and child-level named genes would be excessively specific. No additional attributes or results are introduced."
442114006,"Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar 6,7:-:1,2 (organism)","Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 6,7:-:1,2 (organism)","Adding “(organism)” clarifies the category without altering the taxonomic identification, which is the Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar 6,7:-:1,2. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This text maps to SCTID 442114006. Parent concepts would be overly broad; sibling serovars would be different antigenic formulas. No clinical attributes are present, ensuring the coding remains at the organism level."
422040009,Subfamily Nycteribiinae (organism),Nycteribiinae [subfamily],"The bracketed 'subfamily' clarifies the taxonomic rank of Nycteribiinae without altering meaning. In SNOMED CT this is an Organism and corresponds directly to Subfamily Nycteribiinae (422040009). It does not indicate a different level (family, genus, species) or introduce any clinical context beyond naming the organism, so parent, child, or sibling concepts would be less accurate."
1306656004,Photographic extraoral image of left half of face with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Imaging record: extraoral left facial half photograph with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion.,"The statement conveys an imaging record artifact showing an extraoral photograph of the left facial half, with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. This directly matches SCTID 1306656004. Concepts for full-face, right-sided, or smiling/retracted images would be incorrect; the wording uses equivalent synonyms without altering the defined attributes."
105351001,Trimipramine measurement (procedure),Quantify trimipramine level,"Quantifying the level is equivalent to measuring trimipramine concentration, without additional attributes. This is a Procedure and corresponds to Trimipramine measurement (105351001). More general parent concepts on quantifying substances lack the specific analyte focus, and sibling analyte measurements are not applicable. No specimen or method is indicated, avoiding child concepts and supporting the base measurement code."
411806007,Ephestia kuehniella diagnostic allergen extract (product),Ephestia kuehniella allergen extract for diagnostic use,"The entry conveys that the allergen extract is intended for diagnostic use and derives from Ephestia kuehniella, which defines a specific product. This matches SNOMED CT Product concept SCTID 411806007. The phrase “for diagnostic use” is essential to differentiate it from therapeutic allergen extracts and avoids ambiguity. Parent concepts lack species detail, and sibling species would not be correct. No attributes like brand, formulation, dose, or procedural actions are present, ensuring the concept remains the diagnostic allergen extract product for this species."
216441001,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, harbor (environment)",Place of occurrence: harbor (accident/poisoning),"This phrasing identifies the environmental setting for an accident or poisoning as a harbor, which is precisely the scope of SNOMED CT 216441001. It encodes only the place-of-occurrence context without adding mechanism or other attributes, fitting the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. Parent concepts without specifying harbor would be too general, and alternatives like dock or marina are different location types, making the given harbor concept the most accurate match."
468483000,"Dental occlusal splint, preformed (physical object)",Preformed occlusal splint available,"This notes availability of a preformed occlusal splint; the object is a premanufactured occlusal device. Category: Physical object (Device). The explicit 'preformed' makes SCTID 468483000 the most precise match. Parent concepts would be underspecified, and siblings indicating custom-made devices or other mouthguards would be incorrect. No added attributes like indication, site, or material are present."
284437009,Farm track (environment),Location described as farm track,"The entry describes the location and names it as a farm track, focusing strictly on place without adding other clinical elements. Category: Environment or geographical location. The phrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term, specifying the exact environment and avoiding broader or different locations. Code 284437009 is the most accurate selection."
1290318003,Hodapp Parrish Anderson glaucoma staging system (staging scale),Glaucoma staged using Hodapp–Parrish–Anderson system,"This entry states that glaucoma staging is performed using the Hodapp–Parrish–Anderson system, identifying the specific staging scale without assigning a stage or other attributes. The main concept is the named staging tool; no severity, laterality, or associated conditions are mentioned. In SNOMED CT, it maps to an Assessment scale/Staging scale. The explicit naming of the Hodapp–Parrish–Anderson system makes SCTID 1290318003 the precise match. A parent like general glaucoma staging lacks the specific methodology, and siblings denote alternative systems. The phraseology is a usage context but still denotes the same scale, not altering the code."
309263001,Rectal polyp specimen (specimen),Rectal polyp tissue specimen,"This is a specimen terminology indicating tissue taken from a rectal polyp. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The best match is 309263001 'Rectal polyp specimen (specimen)' since it captures both the source lesion (polyp) and the anatomical site (rectum). Parent concepts like 'rectal tissue specimen' lack the lesion specificity, while 'polyp specimen' lacks site specificity. No collection method or processing attributes are stated, so child concepts with method qualifiers are inappropriate. 'Tissue specimen' is a standard synonymic phrasing that does not change the underlying concept."
469590003,Hyperthermia system generator (physical object),Generator for hyperthermia system,"The phrase names the generator specifically as a component of a hyperthermia system, emphasizing its role providing energy. Main concept: hyperthermia system generator. No additional attributes (e.g., power level, modality, operational state) are present. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. SCTID 469590003 is the precise code, as it represents the generator within the hyperthermia system. Using a broader code for the entire system would not reflect the component-level specificity, and children/siblings that specify a particular energy type or an applicator/console would be misaligned. The wording is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term, maintaining equivalence."
764132007,Product containing dopamine receptor antagonist (product),Formulary entry: dopamine receptor antagonist product,"A formulary listing for a product defined by dopamine receptor antagonist pharmacology indicates a medicinal product class without specifying individual ingredients or dosage forms. SNOMED CT category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product, best matched by “Product containing dopamine receptor antagonist (product)” SCTID 764132007. Mapping to a substance concept would be incorrect because this concerns products, and selecting a child product would be too specific given the generic phrasing."
441790005,"Heart murmur, undetermined whether functional or organic (situation)",Summary: Heart murmur—uncertain if innocent/functional or organic/pathologic.,"The summary identifies a heart murmur and expresses uncertainty between innocent/functional and organic/pathologic categories, exactly matching the Situation intent of 441790005. Parent 'Heart murmur' lacks the uncertainty; child/sibling concepts that fix the murmur as functional or organic would contradict the entry. The synonyms used are standard clinical equivalents and do not introduce extra attributes."
223672001,Netherlands (geographic location),Country: Netherlands,"This format is typical of structured clinical or administrative documentation where the value is the geographic place. The main concept conveyed is the Netherlands as a country, with the label 'Country:' serving only as context. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 223672001 correctly codes the value. Concepts like 'Residence in Netherlands' or 'Nationality: Dutch' would add additional semantics not present here; this entry encodes only the place value. No parent/child/sibling alternatives fit better than the named country."
771259006,Product containing tetracycline structure (product),Tetracycline-class medication product,"This phrase identifies a medication product in the tetracycline class, i.e., based on tetracycline chemical structure. It should be coded to Product containing tetracycline structure (771259006) in the Pharmaceutical/biologic product category. The entry remains class-level and product-focused, avoiding substance-level mapping and not naming specific derivatives, dose forms, or routes, so child concepts are not appropriate. The term “class” is a clinically equivalent way to denote the structural grouping."
434619003,Methanocorpusculum bavaricum (organism),Methanocorpusculum bavaricum (organism),"Main concept: Methanocorpusculum bavaricum as an organism, explicitly noted without any clinical finding or presence statements. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The wording reproduces the fully specified name, which maps directly to 434619003. Parent concepts (genus-level or Archaea) are too general, and child/sibling concepts (other species or findings of presence) are not indicated."
214436006,Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving fall down stairs of motor bus while boarding or alighting (event),Noncollision MVA; fall down motor bus steps while alighting.,"This statement captures a noncollision motor vehicle accident involving a fall down the steps (stairs) of a motor bus during alighting. Main concept: Event of noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident with fall down bus stairs while alighting. SNOMED CT category: Event. SCTID 214436006 is the most precise match because it includes the noncollision attribute, the motor bus, the stair mechanism, and the alighting context. A generic bus accident or a collision-based MVA would be less accurate. Using “steps” for “stairs” and “alighting” for “getting off” are equivalent synonyms and do not introduce additional attributes or change the code selection."
773597004,Orthopedic care plan (record artifact),Orthopaedic care plan record artifact,"This entry explicitly labels the item as a 'record artifact' and specifies the orthopaedic care plan. Category: Record artifact. Orthopedic care plan (record artifact) [773597004] precisely fits the description. Using the parent Care plan artifact would be less specific because the specialty qualifier is important. The spelling 'orthopaedic' is a synonymous variant, and stating 'record artifact' does not change the concept—it matches the hierarchy classification."
263917001,Underactive (qualifier value),"Underactive, as recorded","The entry indicates that the recorded value is “Underactive,” which is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT (263917001). No attributes like timing, severity, or organ/system are added, maintaining the purity of the qualifier. Broader or different qualifiers (e.g., “Reduced”) would not match the exact wording, and disorder/finding concepts would add unintended specificity. Therefore, the Underactive qualifier value is the most precise code choice."
432045005,Entire urinary tract proper (body structure),Entire urinary tract proper,"The main concept is the anatomical body structure of the urinary tract proper taken in its entirety. This is a Body structure category term in SNOMED CT. The phrase explicitly includes both the qualifier “proper,” which denotes the tract itself (excluding accessory tissues) and “entire,” which specifies the whole structure rather than a part. This matches SNOMED CT 432045005 exactly. Broader parents such as “urinary system” or siblings like “entire urinary tract” (which may be interpreted to include renal parenchyma) are less precise, and children like “upper” or “lower” urinary tract are too specific. No additional attributes (severity, timing, laterality) are introduced."
412178008,Echinacea + bioflavonoid + vitamin C (product),Discharge plan includes echinacea with bioflavonoid and vitamin C,"The discharge plan references a product that includes echinacea, bioflavonoid, and vitamin C. The SNOMED CT category is Product. This maps to SCTID 412178008, since it identifies only those three ingredients and no extra details (like dose or form) that would narrow to a child concept. Parent or sibling concepts lacking one of the components or indicating different combinations are not appropriate given the explicit listing."
1290112006,Product containing phytocannabinoid (product),Patient reports use of a plant-derived cannabinoid product,"The patient-reported context indicates use but does not modify the product’s identity: a plant-derived (phytocannabinoid) cannabinoid product. Category is Product. The wording avoids specificity (e.g., THC/CBD), formulation, indication, or regulatory status, preventing mapping to children or other siblings. It is explicitly plant-derived, so synthetic cannabinoid products are excluded, making SCTID 1290112006 the correct match."
297290004,Afro-Asiatic language (qualifier value),Afro-Asiatic language specified,"The entry shows the specified value is 'Afro-Asiatic language', i.e., the language group qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. The most precise code is 297290004; broader parents (Language) or sibling groups are not appropriate, and naming a specific Afro-Asiatic language would be too granular. No additional attributes are implied."
61092003,Common diving petrel (organism),Bird: Common diving petrel,"This entry identifies the bird species as the common diving petrel, which corresponds to SNOMED CT Organism concept 61092003. The category is Organism. The “Bird:” prefix is a contextual classification consistent with the species and does not add attributes such as exposure or injury. A generic bird concept (parent) would be too broad, and another diving petrel species (sibling) would be incorrect. The species-level organism code is most accurate."
305465003,Under care of intensive care specialist (finding),Care supervised by critical care consultant,"The statement indicates that care is being supervised by a critical care consultant, i.e., an intensive care specialist, which is a Clinical finding and maps to Under care of intensive care specialist (305465003). It does not add attributes like reason for care or place of service. 'Critical care consultant' is a regional synonym for intensivist and does not alter the concept; generic 'under care of specialist' or other specialist types would be less specific."
117638008,3-Hydroxysebacate measurement (procedure),3-hydroxysebacate measurement,"The entry explicitly names the procedure of measuring the compound 3-hydroxysebacate, with no added attributes such as specimen, method, timing, or related conditions. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This is a direct match to the concept 3-hydroxysebacate measurement (SCTID 117638008). Broader parent procedures like general organic acid measurements or unspecified analyte measurements would be less precise, and child concepts specifying specimen or technique would be too detailed. The exact preferred term ensures the most precise code selection."
700637001,Infant inguinal hernia truss (physical object),Inguinal hernia support belt (infant),"This phrase describes a support belt for inguinal hernia intended for an infant; in clinical usage, an inguinal hernia support belt functions as a truss. It is a Physical object. SCTID 700637001 is appropriate because the device is infant-specific and for inguinal hernia support. A generic belt or non-infant truss would be less precise. ‘Support belt’ is a clinically equivalent synonym for truss in this context and does not introduce new attributes."
438370008,Vascular disease risk assessment declined (situation),Patient declined proposed vascular disease risk assessment.,"The entry records refusal of a proposed vascular disease risk assessment, focusing on the declination. This is a Situation with explicit context; SNOMED CT code 438370008 is the most accurate match. The term 'proposed' does not alter the concept—it remains a refusal of that specific assessment. Broader 'procedure declined' or different-domain risk assessment concepts would be less appropriate based on the wording."
369283008,Entire lateral recess of fourth ventricle (body structure),Region labeled: complete lateral recess of the fourth ventricle,"Main concept: labeling the complete lateral recess of the fourth ventricle. Explicit attribute: “complete” indicates the entire structure. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This aligns best with SCTID 369283008, which specifically denotes the entire lateral recess. A generic or unspecified parent concept would not reflect completeness, and sibling or child concepts involving laterality or substructures (e.g., walls) are not indicated. The labeling context does not introduce new clinical attributes; it identifies the anatomical entity."
281152007,Entire pancreaticoduodenal lymph node (body structure),Anatomic site: pancreaticoduodenal lymph node,"Framed as an anatomic site, this entry identifies the pancreaticoduodenal lymph node as the referenced structure, implicitly the whole anatomical node without any additional clinical modifiers. It belongs to the Body structure hierarchy and corresponds to SCTID 281152007. Parent-level nodes are too broad, and other abdominal lymph nodes (siblings) are distinct sites, making them less appropriate. The contextual label “Anatomic site” does not change the structure being named, so the same code applies."
118340008,Pulsed laser beam (physical force),Pulsed laser light beam,"Adding 'light' acknowledges that lasers are coherent light sources and does not introduce a new attribute. The entry still denotes a laser beam with pulsed emission, matching the Physical force concept. Parent 'Laser beam' lacks the pulsed specification, and siblings indicating different emission modes would be inaccurate. The term remains clinically equivalent to 'pulsed laser beam,' justifying SCTID 118340008."
256241002,Direct current (physical force),Unidirectional electric current,"The term 'unidirectional' indicates an electric current flowing in one direction, which is the defining property of direct current. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. This is an exact synonym for Direct current (physical force), without implying exposure, injury, or device use, and is therefore more specific than parent electric current and distinct from alternating current."
704767006,Radiation therapy treatment planning workstation (physical object),Radiation therapy planning workstation unit,"The term “unit” here refers to the physical workstation apparatus used in radiation therapy treatment planning. No extra attributes (e.g., brand, location) are present. Category: Physical object; code: 704767006. “Unit” is a neutral synonym for a discrete piece of equipment and does not alter the intended concept. Parent categories are overly general, while siblings such as delivery consoles or imaging units carry different purposes. Software/system concepts would be incorrect because the entry denotes hardware."
397966007,Documents (qualifier value),Type: Documents,"The phrase declares 'Documents' as a type value, which fits a categorical/qualifier context rather than an instance of documentation. The main concept is 'Documents (qualifier value)'. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. This maps to SCTID 397966007 because it serves as a type designation for an attribute field. Choosing a record artifact code would imply a concrete document, not a value selection. No additional attributes (e.g., electronic, clinical, legal) are introduced, keeping the selection generic and linked to the qualifier value."
256240001,Alternating current (physical force),"Alternating current, physical force","The entry explicitly labels alternating current as a physical force, matching the SNOMED CT hierarchy. No additional attributes (exposure, injury, magnitude, timing) are present. This maps directly to Alternating current (physical force) [256240001]. A more general parent like Electrical current (physical force) would be less exact, and siblings such as Direct current are incompatible with 'alternating'. Therefore, 256240001 is the most precise concept."
224646003,Terraced house (environment),Patient’s home is a terraced house,"The statement identifies the patient’s home environment as a terraced house, directly corresponding to the environment concept SCTID 224646003. No additional details (e.g., location specifics or event context) are added. A general house category would be insufficiently specific, and other housing forms would be inaccurate, confirming 224646003 as the best match."
4241000179101,Laboratory report (record artifact),Laboratory report (record artifact),"The entry mirrors the preferred term with an explicit mention of the artifact category, making the mapping unambiguous. It is a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. No attributes such as result interpretation, timing, or departmental subtype are introduced. Choosing a parent report artifact would be less specific, and sibling reports (radiology, operative) would be incorrect. SCTID 4241000179101 is the exact concept intended."
432982004,Specimen from peritoneum obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Fine needle aspiration cytology specimen—peritoneum,"The text indicates a cytology specimen produced by fine needle aspiration from the peritoneum, classed under Specimen. SCTID 432982004 is the specific code tying peritoneum to the FNA biopsy method. More general parent codes lack the method detail, while sibling codes for peritoneal fluid or washings represent different specimen types. The phrase “cytology specimen” is commonly used for FNA material and is clinically equivalent without changing the underlying concept or code."
715189003,Referral to critical care service (procedure),ED note: referral to critical care service,"The ED context indicates where the documentation occurs, while the main act remains a referral to the critical care service. No additional qualifiers (e.g., urgency, indication) are included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and SCTID 715189003 is the precise match for referral to critical care service. Sibling concepts such as transfer/admission or consult requests are different procedural intents. The ED note context does not change the encoded action."
83543000,Structure of cartilage of auditory canal (body structure),Cartilaginous portion of the auditory canal,"Main concept: the cartilaginous portion of the auditory canal as an anatomical site. No attributes like laterality, segment extent, or pathology are added. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. This phrase precisely targets the cartilage component of the ear canal, matching Structure of cartilage of auditory canal (83543000). A parent such as auditory canal structure would include bone and soft tissue beyond cartilage; a sibling such as auricular cartilage is unrelated. Children specifying side or finer subparts are not implied here. The paraphrase remains equivalent to the concept."
388495005,Genus Chrysocyon (organism),Taxonomy entry reads Chrysocyon (genus),"The entry reports a taxonomy designation of Chrysocyon at genus level, making the concept clear. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It most precisely matches Genus Chrysocyon (388495005), excluding family-level parents and species-level children. Siblings are irrelevant because the genus is explicitly named. The phrasing is a contextual paraphrase that maintains identical coding scope."
23961000181104,Agrococcus versicolor (organism),Agrococcus versicolor,"The main concept is the species-level organism Agrococcus versicolor. No clinical context, site, presence, or disease is asserted; it is simply the taxonomic name. In SNOMED CT this belongs to the Organism category, and the precise match is the species concept Agrococcus versicolor (organism). A parent such as Agrococcus (genus) or Bacteria (organism) would be too broad, and any sibling species would be incorrect. The entry uses the exact species name, so it does not introduce attributes that would shift coding to a finding (e.g., organism present) or disorder."
773389007,Product containing renal hormone (product),Discharge medication: renal hormone–containing product,"This note indicates a discharge medication and specifies it as a product containing a renal hormone. The discharge context does not change the product’s classification. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and the appropriate mapping is “Product containing renal hormone (product).” Parents like generic drug product categories lack renal specificity, and children naming particular renal hormones are too specific, as none is identified."
223782008,Western Australia (geographic location),Residence: Western Australia,"Here Western Australia is specified as the residence location; the coded concept is the geographic location Western Australia (geographic location), SCTID 223782008. The main concept is the location, with “Residence” serving only as context. Category: Geographic location. This does not map better to the parent country or a sibling state, and it avoids subregional specificity, making the state-level concept the precise selection."
81202007,Absent muscle function (finding),Clinical impression: muscle function absent,"The clinician’s impression records the absence of muscle function, which is a Clinical finding. This aligns with SNOMED CT 81202007 as it denotes complete absence without additional qualifiers. Parent concepts such as impaired muscle function are less precise, and siblings like weakness or paresis suggest partial function. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase and does not change the code selection."
408473007,Public health dentistry (qualifier value),Specialty designation: dental public health,"This states a specialty designation with the value 'dental public health,' an accepted synonym for public health dentistry. The main concept is the specialty as a Qualifier value, corresponding to SNOMED CT 408473007. No occupation, department, or action is implied. Parent dental categories are too general, and sibling specialties do not match the designation given, supporting the precise choice of this qualifier."
421753003,New Hampshire (geographic location),U.S. state: New Hampshire,"The concept is the U.S. state named New Hampshire. Category: Location (Geographical location). The phrasing 'U.S. state' is contextual but does not add attributes; it confirms the geopolitical level and maps to 421753003. Parent concepts such as 'United States of America' or 'New England region' are too broad, and child concepts like specific towns are absent. The synonym is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and remains uniquely codable to the state."
541261000124104,Chaetomium novozelandicum (organism),Documented taxonomic species: Chaetomium novozelandicum,"This states the taxonomic species explicitly, with no added clinical attributes. The main concept is the organism, mapping to the SNOMED CT Organism category. The best match is SCTID 541261000124104 for Chaetomium novozelandicum. Using a parent (genus or higher taxa) would be less precise, and siblings refer to other species. The phrase 'documented' is contextual and does not shift coding away from the organism concept."
223499005,Antarctica (geographic location),Referenced location: Antarctica,"The text specifies the referenced location as Antarctica. The main concept is Antarctica, and the category is Location/Geographic location. The contextual phrasing does not introduce new attributes; it simply points to the named location. This aligns directly with 223499005 and avoids mapping to broader or different geographic concepts such as Antarctic region or specific Antarctic sub-areas."
219329006,Hanging of unknown intent (event),Reported hanging of unspecified intent,"This describes a reported hanging event where intent is unspecified/unknown, categorized as an Event. SCTID 219329006 is exact because it captures both hanging and unknown intent. Intent-specific children like accidental or self-harm are excluded, and generic undetermined-intent events are overly broad. The term “unspecified intent” is synonymous with unknown intent; the word “reported” is context and does not change the underlying concept."
223757008,Regions of Malaysia (geographic location),Regional areas in Malaysia,"This entry is synonymous with the preferred term, expressing the plural set of regional locations situated within Malaysia. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. It maps to SCTID 223757008 because it refers to regions generally, not to the country per se or to individual named regions. Choosing a parent like Malaysia or a specific child region would misrepresent the stated scope. No external attributes (e.g., travel, residence, timing) are implied, keeping the code selection precise."
303010008,Hepatitis A gamma globulin given (situation),Hepatitis A gamma globulin was given,"The sentence states plainly that hepatitis A gamma globulin was given, indicating a completed administration event. This falls under the Situation hierarchy and corresponds exactly to Hepatitis A gamma globulin given (situation), SCTID 303010008. Using a broader concept without hepatitis A would be less precise, and vaccine-related codes would misrepresent passive immunization. The wording is a direct synonym for the preferred term and does not introduce any additional attributes."
255549009,Anterior (qualifier value),Imaging report uses 'anterior' as the location descriptor,"Within an imaging context, 'anterior' is explicitly the location descriptor, indicating forward orientation and nothing else. This is a Qualifier value, so Anterior (qualifier value) [255549009] is the exact match. Selecting a parent positional concept would be too general, and siblings (posterior, superior, inferior) are not supported by the text. No anatomy or compound directional term is included, preventing a more specific child mapping."
11478001,Sacral spinal cord structure (body structure),Anatomical landmark: sacral spinal cord,"This describes the sacral spinal cord as an anatomical landmark, remaining within the Body structure domain. The correct SNOMED CT match is Sacral spinal cord structure (11478001). Using 'landmark' does not add pathology or procedural detail. A general spinal cord parent would be less precise, and child concepts like individual sacral segments would be too specific. Siblings such as cauda equina or conus medullaris are not indicated."
2617007,Fall from scaffold (event),Fell off scaffold,"“Fell off scaffold” unambiguously identifies the mechanism as a fall from a scaffold, with no added context like intentionality, timing, or injury. This is an Event and corresponds directly to 2617007 |Fall from scaffold (event)|. Parent concepts like generic fall or fall from height would be less specific. Sibling mechanisms (ladder, stairs, roof) are not supported here. The phrase “off” is a natural linguistic variant of “from,” and does not alter the clinical concept or code selection."
324116004,Product containing aminoglycoside (product),Dispensed item: product containing aminoglycoside,"The core concept is a product that contains an aminoglycoside, noted in a dispensing context. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The mapping is to SNOMED CT 324116004, as the entry refers to a product-level class containment (aminoglycoside) without naming a specific molecule or dose form. A parent-level antibiotic product is less precise, and child-level specific agent products are not implied. The dispensing context does not introduce attributes that change the product code selection."
223591005,Malaysia (geographic location),Malaysia entered as location,"The entry indicates Malaysia has been entered as the location, aligning with Malaysia (geographic location) SCTID 223591005 under the Qualifier value hierarchy. The documentation verb ""entered"" does not add clinical attributes or change meaning. Parent concepts like Asia or Country are too broad, and child concepts such as regional subdivisions are not specified. The country-level Malaysia concept remains the most precise match."
256639008,Biological glue (substance),Biological tissue glue,"The phrase denotes a glue substance intended for tissue, with biological origin, which directly matches Biological glue (substance). The SNOMED CT category is Substance and the best code is SCTID 256639008. It avoids procedural application language and does not specify a particular subtype, ensuring it is not better mapped to a child like fibrin glue or albumin-glutaraldehyde adhesive."
18507001,"Osteotomy, subtrochanteric, with external fixation and cast (procedure)",Subtrochanteric osteotomy—external fixation and casting performed,"This documentation states a subtrochanteric osteotomy with both external fixation and casting performed, exactly matching the SNOMED CT Procedure 18507001. The core elements are the anatomical site and the dual stabilization methods. Parent concepts lacking method specificity or different-site osteotomies would be less precise. The noun “casting” is a direct synonym of “cast application,” and the overall phrasing does not introduce additional attributes."
364089000,Systemic arterial feature (observable entity),Property of systemic arteries,"This wording denotes a generic observable property of systemic arteries and is conceptually equivalent to 'systemic arterial feature'. The main concept is an observable entity tied to the systemic arterial circulation. The most accurate SNOMED CT code is Systemic arterial feature [364089000] because the phrase specifies systemic arteries and remains non-specific about which property. A broader parent (Arterial feature) would not capture the systemic qualifier, and a sibling like Pulmonary arterial feature is clearly not intended. No child concept is implied due to the lack of a specific property name."
162486004,Exercise relieves symptom (finding),Symptom control via exercise.,"The entry indicates that symptoms are controlled through exercise, which in clinical usage reflects relief due to exercise and maps to Exercise relieves symptom (SCTID 162486004), a Clinical finding. ""Control"" here is equivalent to relief in the context of exercise as the relieving modality. Using a more general parent concept would omit the exercise factor, and siblings representing different relieving mechanisms or exercise-induced exacerbation would misrepresent the stated relationship."
442039000,Measurement of albumin gradient between serum specimen and ascitic fluid specimen (procedure),SAAG measurement,"“SAAG” is the common clinical acronym for the serum–ascites albumin gradient. The entry denotes the measurement procedure, making it a Procedure. It matches SCTID 442039000 because the procedure specifically calculates the gradient between serum and ascitic fluid albumin concentrations. More general laboratory procedures or ascitic fluid analysis would be nonspecific, and results-only findings of SAAG would be a different category (Clinical finding/Observable). The synonym is standard clinical shorthand and does not alter the concept."
444933003,Home hospice service (qualifier value),Hospice services in the home,"This entry communicates that the hospice services are delivered in the home, which is the same qualifier value represented by home hospice service. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value because it specifies service-type/setting rather than a procedure or clinical finding. Parent concepts (e.g., hospice service) lack the home specificity, and sibling concepts (e.g., hospital hospice service) are incorrect given the location. The plurality does not alter meaning; SCTID 444933003 remains the precise match."
51654000,Freezing weather (physical force),Patient-reported weather: freezing,"The entry captures a patient’s report that the weather is freezing, which still denotes the environmental physical force of freezing weather. Category: Physical force. Patient-report context does not change the concept or add new attributes such as exposure or severity. It is distinct from other cold-related phenomena. The appropriate code is Freezing weather (physical force) SCTID 51654000."
160301004,Family history of endocrine disorders (situation),Family history significant for endocrine disorders,"The phrase indicates the presence of endocrine disorders within the family history. ‘Significant’ is commonly used in clinical notes to denote relevance but does not introduce severity or specify a particular disorder. The SNOMED CT category is Situation (family history), and SCTID 160301004 directly captures this documentation. It avoids more specific child codes by not naming a particular endocrine disease and remains distinct from siblings such as personal history of endocrine disease. Thus, the general family-history-of-endocrine-disorders concept is the most exact match."
315442003,Born in Hungary (finding),Radiology report demographics indicate born in Hungary.,"The demographic detail in an imaging report states the patient was born in Hungary, which remains a Clinical finding of birthplace. The most precise SNOMED CT code is 'Born in Hungary (finding)' [315442003]. The reporting context adds no new attributes. Broader parent concepts or sibling country findings would be less suitable. The wording is an equivalent expression of the same finding."
704369007,Fatigue due to treatment (finding),Symptom: tiredness related to treatment,"The documented symptom is tiredness (fatigue) with a relationship to treatment as cause. Category: Clinical finding. This maps to SCTID 704369007, as it captures fatigue and treatment causation without additional attributes or specifying therapy types. The parent 'Fatigue' concept omits the causal detail, and child/sibling concepts naming specific treatments or adverse events are not supported. 'Tiredness' is a clinically accepted synonym for fatigue."
223698007,Antigua and Barbuda (geographic location),Country recorded as Antigua and Barbuda,"This indicates an administrative recording of the country value, which is Antigua and Barbuda. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223698007 is the exact match for the nation. No additional attributes about the relationship to the patient (e.g., birth, residency) are specified, and there is no implication of a parent region or child locality, ensuring precise coding to the country."
768622009,Product containing cerium and/or cerium compound (product),Product with a cerium compound,"The wording specifies a product that contains a cerium compound, placing it under SNOMED CT product concept 768622009, which covers cerium and/or cerium compounds as ingredients. The category is Product. No route, dose, indication, or specific compound name is given, so it remains appropriately general. It is more precise than a parent concept of generic product and does not fit substance-only concepts. While the text emphasizes a compound, the broader concept explicitly includes products containing cerium compounds; naming a particular compound (e.g., cerium oxide) would risk a child concept, which is not done here, ensuring correct mapping to the given code."
35971002,Ambulatory care site (environment),Encounter location: ambulatory care site,"The entry records the encounter location and identifies it as an ambulatory care site, indicating a non-inpatient care environment. The main concept is the care environment; there are no explicit attributes beyond location type. Within SNOMED CT, this is an Environment or geographical location, and 35971002 is the precise match. Parent concepts (e.g., healthcare facility) are too broad, while children or siblings such as outpatient clinic, urgent care center, or primary care clinic would add specificity that the text does not include."
242362008,Accidental ingestion of clove oil (event),Accidentally swallowed clove oil,"“Swallowed” directly indicates ingestion, and “accidentally” conveys unintentional nature; the substance is clove oil. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242362008 precisely matches the described event. Parents that omit the specific agent or siblings for other essential oils are inferior matches. The statement does not imply poisoning, clinical findings, or symptoms, so disorder or finding codes are not appropriate. The synonym “swallowed” does not change code selection because it is equivalent to ingestion."
702910007,Pelvic floor clinic (environment),Patient seen at the pelvic floor clinic,"The phrase indicates the site where the patient was seen, namely a pelvic floor clinic, which fits Pelvic floor clinic (environment) SCTID 702910007. Category: Environment or geographical location. The encounter context (“seen at”) does not add attributes to the clinic concept; it remains an environmental reference. More general clinic concepts or siblings like departments/centers would be less specific than the explicit clinic term used here."
767014001,Allergy to hypothalamic hormone (finding),Patient reports hypothalamic hormone allergy,"The statement captures a patient-reported allergy with the allergen class being hypothalamic hormone, without adding details such as severity or specific agents. It is a Clinical finding and maps to SCTID 767014001. Parent concepts like 'Allergy to hormone' would be too broad, and children specifying an individual hypothalamic hormone are not stated. The wording reflects documentation context but remains semantically equivalent to 'Allergy to hypothalamic hormone.'"
44249009,Structure of temporoparietal muscle (body structure),Temporoparietalis (muscle),"The text identifies the named muscle 'temporoparietalis' and clarifies it as a muscle, conveying just the anatomical entity. In SNOMED CT this is a Body structure, with the specific concept Structure of temporoparietal muscle (44249009). No laterality, condition, or procedure is implied. Using the formal anatomical name avoids mapping to nearby structures like temporalis or temporoparietal fascia, ensuring the precise match."
223803005,Leitrim (geographic location),"Leitrim, Ireland","This phrasing identifies the place 'Leitrim' and clarifies country context ('Ireland') without changing the underlying concept, which remains the geographic location Leitrim (SCTID: 223803005). Category: Location (Geographic location). Adding the country does not introduce new clinical attributes; it simply disambiguates the place identity and does not shift coding to a parent concept (e.g., Ireland) or a child/sibling place. Thus, the precise code for Leitrim as a geographic location is appropriate."
898189008,Contact with hot or corrosive substance (event),Event documented: contact with hot or corrosive substance,"The wording explicitly frames the occurrence as an event and specifies contact with a hot or corrosive substance, matching the SNOMED CT Event concept Contact with hot or corrosive substance (event) [898189008]. The documentation phrasing does not introduce attributes like timing, intent, or injury and does not constrain the event to only heat or only corrosive contact. Therefore, more general or more specific related concepts would not fit as precisely."
359561007,Brockman operation (procedure),Discharge summary: Brockman operation,"Within a discharge summary context, the named concept remains the Brockman operation, categorized as a Procedure. The best code match is Brockman operation (procedure) SCTID 359561007. Coding to a generic parent would sacrifice specificity, and no qualifiers (e.g., site, indication, variant) appear that would suggest a different concept. The context of a discharge summary does not add clinical attributes; it merely indicates where the procedure is documented, so the code stays the same."
367786005,Entire fetal bone of thoracic cage (body structure),Entire fetal thoracic cage skeletal bones,"The term “skeletal bones” emphasizes the bony elements; paired with “entire fetal thoracic cage,” it clearly targets the complete set of bones of the fetal thoracic cage. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps to 367786005 because it references all bones making up the fetal thoracic cage without implicating other tissues or conditions. Parent concepts lack the explicit whole-set attribute, and child concepts for single components (e.g., ribs alone) would not fit. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent."
261476002,Approach via tracheostomy tube (qualifier value),Entry through tracheostomy tube,"This indicates that the entry point/approach is through a tracheostomy tube, which matches the qualifier 'Approach via tracheostomy tube'. Category: Qualifier value. 'Entry' is a synonym for approach in procedural contexts and adds no further details. It is not a procedure concept and does not drift to siblings like stoma-only or endotracheal approaches, ensuring precise mapping to 261476002."
411780009,Cynodon dactylon diagnostic allergen extract (product),Cynodon dactylon diagnostic allergen extract listed in test set,"This identifies the Cynodon dactylon diagnostic allergen extract product as part of a test set, without changing the product’s identity. It maps to the SNOMED CT Product SCTID 411780009. The listing context is neutral and does not imply therapeutic use, mixtures, or general allergen substances. No additional attributes such as concentration or result are present. Thus, the specific diagnostic product code is the best fit."
114402001,Salmonella Agbara (organism),Salmonella Agbara (organism),"The parenthetical explicitly clarifies the taxonomic nature of the term, pointing to the organism entity and nothing else. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, matching SCTID 114402001 precisely. This avoids mapping to disorder or infection findings, and is more specific than parent concepts such as Salmonella genus. The synonym usage simply disambiguates the entity type and does not add clinical attributes."
702813008,Acquired immune deficiency syndrome clinic (environment),Services provided at the AIDS clinic,"The entry notes that services occur at the AIDS clinic, keeping the focus on the environment rather than specifying service types. The core concept is the clinic environment dedicated to AIDS. SNOMED CT category is Environment. It aligns with “Acquired immune deficiency syndrome clinic (environment)” SCTID 702813008. Parent clinic concepts are less specific, and sibling HIV clinics are not implied by the wording. No additional attributes are introduced beyond the clinic location."
236842007,Subcutaneous alcohol injection of the vulva (procedure),Ethyl alcohol injected into vulvar subcutaneous layer,"The entry specifies injection of ethyl alcohol into the subcutaneous layer at the vulva, covering agent, route/tissue plane, and site, defining a Procedure. This is the precise match to SCTID 236842007. Parent concepts like generic subcutaneous injections or alcohol injections lacking site are too broad, and siblings with different routes (e.g., intradermal) would not fit. 'Ethyl alcohol' is synonymous with 'ethanol' in clinical context."
216345009,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, garage, place of work (environment)",Place of occurrence of accident/poisoning: workplace garage.,"The entry explicitly states the place where an accident or poisoning occurred as a garage that is part of the workplace. This matches the SNOMED CT Environment category and aligns precisely with 216345009, “Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, garage, place of work (environment).” It is more specific than parent concepts such as generic place of occurrence or generic workplace, and it excludes siblings like home garage or public parking garage by specifying workplace. The wording uses standard phrasing for location context without adding mechanism, severity, or timing, so the concept and code remain unchanged."
31049000,Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (organism),Species: Misgurnus anguillicaudatus,"Main concept: species designation for Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, with no other clinical or contextual attributes. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The species-level binomial directly matches SCTID 31049000. Parent or sibling organism concepts would be less precise or incorrect. The simple species label maintains the focus on the organism and does not add any attributes."
16087131000119103,High risk medication monitoring indicated (situation),Monitoring recommended for high-risk medicines,"“Recommended” is clinically equivalent to “indicated” in documentation and describes a situation where monitoring should occur due to high-risk medicines. This places the entry squarely in SNOMED’s Situation hierarchy. It avoids adding details like modality or schedule, and does not assert that monitoring has been performed. Thus, the exact concept of high-risk medication monitoring indicated is the most precise match, not a general recommendation for monitoring or a specific therapy child."
608865002,Microscopic examination of specimen from urethra (procedure),Urethral sample assessed under microscopy,"The wording signals that a sample from the urethra was assessed using microscopy, which is a laboratory Procedure. It maps to SCTID 608865002 because it combines the microscopy method with the urethral specimen source without adding technique qualifiers. A parent concept lacking the urethra detail is too broad, and any child/sibling concepts specifying Gram staining or other modalities are too narrow and not supported by the text. 'Assessment under microscopy' is equivalent to 'microscopic examination.'"
5584006,Hospital-based outpatient peripheral vascular clinic (environment),Care location: hospital-based ambulatory peripheral vascular clinic,"The entry specifies the care location as a clinic that is hospital-based, ambulatory (a standard synonym for outpatient), and peripheral vascular. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 5584006 is the most precise because it combines hospital-based status, outpatient/ambulatory care, and peripheral vascular specialty. Parent concepts that omit the specialty or hospital-based attribute, or siblings for other specialties (e.g., cardiology) or inpatient settings, would not fit. Using “ambulatory” as a synonym for outpatient is clinically equivalent and does not change the intended concept."
773442006,Podiatric surgery care plan (record artifact),Podiatric surgical care plan discussed,"This phrasing shows that the podiatric surgical care plan was discussed, affirming the existence of the artifact tied to the surgical domain of podiatry. The category is Record artifact. It best matches the podiatric surgery care plan concept since it specifies both care plan and specialty. A generic surgical plan or non-surgical podiatry plan would be less aligned. 'Discussed' describes interaction with the artifact, not a different concept."
705769004,Broach (physical object),Broach noted in the instrument list,"This narrative mentions 'broach' as an instrument included, emphasizing the object name. The main concept remains the broach device. SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The correct code is 705769004. Choosing a parent term like 'surgical instrument' would be less specific, and child/sibling terms (e.g., endodontic broach) are over-specified. The phrase adds documentation context but no attributes of cause, anatomy, size, or use."
263779004,Hyperreflexic (qualifier value),Patient states reflexes are brisk,"Patient-reported description 'brisk' for reflexes is a recognized synonym for 'hyperreflexic' in clinical practice. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, appropriately coded to Hyperreflexic (qualifier value) [263779004]. The entry remains an adjectival value applied to reflexes without new attributes, avoiding mapping to a distinct clinical finding or more specific reflex-type concepts."
161483005,History of Bell's palsy (situation),Past history of Bell's palsy.,"The phrase states that Bell's palsy occurred previously, conveying a historical context only. This belongs to the Situation with explicit context category and aligns directly to History of Bell's palsy (161483005). It is not an active disorder, and it is specific to Bell's palsy rather than to a broader neurologic history concept."
426376002,Family Fusobacteriaceae (organism),Fusobacteriaceae (bacterial family),"The entry clarifies that Fusobacteriaceae is a bacterial family, reinforcing the taxonomic level and organism category. No clinical attributes such as infection or body site are introduced. It most precisely maps to Family Fusobacteriaceae (organism) SCTID 426376002. Parent concepts at higher taxonomic ranks are too general, and child or sibling taxa are at different taxonomic levels. The parenthetical adds clarity without altering the meaning, keeping the mapping at the family-level organism."
411848000,Glycyphagus domesticus diagnostic allergen extract (product),IDT reagent: Glycyphagus domesticus diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry identifies the intradermal testing (IDT) reagent as Glycyphagus domesticus diagnostic allergen extract, focusing on the product used. The main concept is a diagnostic allergen extract product, SNOMED category Product. It fits 411848000 since it denotes the diagnostic preparation from the specified mite, not an immunotherapy extract or a different organism. A parent concept like unspecified diagnostic allergen extract lacks species detail, and siblings such as therapeutic preparations would not match. The IDT context affirms diagnostic purpose without altering the product code."
129006008,Walking (observable entity),Walking annotated,"This phrase notes that walking was annotated, keeping the core concept as Walking (observable entity) SCTID 129006008. Annotation is documentation context and does not add attributes such as assistance, speed, or duration. The entry avoids clinical findings (gait or ability) and does not drift into child observables (e.g., walking speed), making the walking observable the exact code."
119397002,Specimen from penis (specimen),Specimen source listed: penis,"This report-style wording indicates the specimen source is listed as the penis and provides no information about specimen type or technique. It is a Specimen concept and aligns with SNOMED CT 119397002 'Specimen from penis (specimen)'. Broader parents fail to reflect the specific anatomical site, while child concepts (e.g., swab or tissue) add granularity not present in the entry. Sibling concepts for other sources would be incorrect. The phrase is semantically equivalent to the preferred term and does not alter code selection, making 119397002 the precise match."
217846006,Accidentally struck - object falling from stationary vehicle (event),Struck by a package dropping from a stationary delivery van.,"It describes being struck by a package that dropped (fell) from a delivery van that was stationary, fulfilling the accidental strike and falling object from stationary vehicle criteria. This matches SNOMED CT 217846006 (Event). Parents without the vehicle-source detail are less specific, and siblings involving motion or non-falling mechanisms would be inaccurate. 'Dropping' denotes falling and 'stationary' is explicit, ensuring precise mapping."
418161006,Vehicle accident (event),Vehicular accident,"This is a clinically safe synonym of vehicle accident, indicating the event of an accident involving a vehicle, with no added attributes such as mechanism, cause, or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Event. The best match is Vehicle accident (event), SCTID 418161006, because the phrase does not restrict to motor vehicles or traffic-related contexts. Parent concepts like transport accident are too broad, and siblings/children like road traffic accident or motorcycle accident are too specific and not implied here. The synonym does not alter code selection since it is semantically equivalent."
216329007,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, farm (environment)",Incident location: farm (accident/poisoning),"By qualifying 'incident' with 'accident/poisoning', the entry states the place of occurrence as a farm, directly mapping to SNOMED CT 216329007. The main concept is the environment of occurrence, and the category is Environment or geographical location. 'Incident' here is a generic term narrowed appropriately to accident/poisoning, maintaining semantic equivalence. Broader or alternative place-of-occurrence concepts are less precise, and child/sibling places (home, street) are not supported by the text."
285716008,Thermal agent (physical force),Thermal agent in imaging request,"The imaging requisition context states a thermal agent, which aligns with SNOMED CT Thermal agent (physical force) SCTID 285716008. It remains an agent identification without extra attributes like direction (hot/cold) or effects. Parent Physical force is too general, and child concepts for hot or cold are not supported by the wording; therefore, Thermal agent is the most precise match."
21661003,Barometric pressure (physical force),Surrounding atmospheric pressure,"This phrase identifies the atmospheric pressure present in the surroundings, synonymous with barometric pressure as a physical force. The precise code is Barometric pressure (physical force) [21661003]. There is no implication of measurement, change, or clinical condition. Parent Pressure (physical force) is too broad, and other pressure types pertain to different environments or media."
234257007,Excision of femoral lymph nodes group (procedure),Excision of the femoral lymph node group,The entry expresses the surgical removal of the specified femoral lymph node group. Category: Procedure. It corresponds exactly to Excision of femoral lymph nodes group (SCTID: 234257007) and avoids attributes like laterality or radical block dissection. Parent concepts involving broader regional lymph nodes or sibling concepts like biopsy would be less precise given the clear excision of the femoral group.
698490005,Urine dipstick test declined (situation),Urine dip test refused.,"The phrase conveys refusal of the urine 'dip' test, a common shorthand for dipstick testing. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This maps most precisely to Urine dipstick test declined (SCTID 698490005) because it indicates the specific test and the refusal. A parent concept like Procedure refused or Urine test declined would be overly general, and a sibling like Urinalysis microscopy declined would not match. 'Refused' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'declined' without adding attributes."
249008,Ryania (organism),Ryania genus,"The main concept is the plant genus Ryania; the word 'genus' clarifies the taxonomic rank without specifying a species. In SNOMED CT, the correct code is Ryania (organism) SCTID 249008 under the Organism hierarchy. A parent concept such as a general plant category would be less specific, and any child species would be more specific than the entry indicates. The wording does not introduce clinical attributes or situational qualifiers; it simply denotes the taxonomy. 'Genus' here is a clinically equivalent synonym for the organism taxon level and maintains precise coding."
29001000087102,Swab from external stoma wound (specimen),Swab specimen from external stoma wound,"This is a straightforward description of the specimen type and source: a swab from an external stoma wound. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It maps to SCTID 29001000087102 specifically, avoiding broader parents without the external qualifier. Sibling concepts involving different sites or internal stoma mucosa are not implied. The synonym “specimen” does not alter the code selection."
68474009,Giant salamander (organism),Chart entry: giant salamander,"The wording indicates a documentation context (chart entry) naming giant salamander and does not introduce any attribute beyond the organism identification. It maps cleanly to SNOMED CT 68474009 in the Organism category. Broader parents or other amphibian organisms are not referenced, and no child species are specified, making Giant salamander (organism) the precise match. The context label does not change the concept selection."
705339008,Assistive clothing (physical object),Supplies: adaptive apparel,"This supply list entry specifies adaptive apparel, which is synonymous with assistive clothing. The concept is a physical object and is best coded as Assistive clothing (physical object) SCTID 705339008. The supply context does not introduce procedural content or additional attributes; it only identifies the object type. It is not generic clothing and does not imply protective or therapeutic garments, so the assistive clothing code is the most appropriate."
421088005,North Carolina (geographic location),Imaging site location: North Carolina,"The context is an imaging report field; the location value is North Carolina, which is the concept to be coded. This aligns with North Carolina (geographic location), SCTID 421088005. The main concept is the geographic location; procedural context does not alter the place concept. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. The entry remains specific to the named state and does not suggest parent country or child city, supporting the precise match."
53175000,Oil of celery (substance),Substance identified in records: celery oil,"The entry states that the records identify the substance celery oil; this is context about documentation rather than a clinical detection or product specification. As a Substance category concept, it aligns with SNOMED CT Oil of celery (53175000). Broader categories or different celery-derived substances would be less precise. The synonym 'celery oil' is equivalent to 'oil of celery' and does not change code choice."
309179009,Nasal polyp specimen (specimen),Accessioned nasal polyp specimen,"This standard lab phrasing indicates that the specimen, sourced from a nasal polyp, was accessioned. The main concept is a specimen; no additional attributes are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the exact match is 'Nasal polyp specimen.' It avoids broader parent concepts and excludes method-specific or preservation-specific child concepts, as well as the sibling disorder."
184880006,Application to register disabled report (record artifact),Application form for disabled report registration,"This entry denotes the same application artifact, presented as a form used for disabled report registration. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 184880006 is the correct and most specific code since the document is the application to register a disabled report. Parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling artifacts like disability benefit applications or certificates would be inaccurate. The phrase 'for ... registration' retains equivalence to the preferred term without additional attributes."
417128001,Bisphosphonates contraindicated (situation),Medication contraindication—bisphosphonates.,"This entry records a medication contraindication specifically for the bisphosphonate class, with no mention of reasons, routes, or timing. It falls under the SNOMED CT Situation category and maps most accurately to 417128001 (Bisphosphonates contraindicated). A broader medication contraindication concept would be nonspecific, and a child concept for a single bisphosphonate agent would be overly specific. The phrasing is a safe paraphrase that retains the same clinical scope."
55161005,Stripping of fascia (procedure),Surgical record: stripping of fascia,"The surgical record entry names the procedure as stripping of fascia, with no additional attributes such as site or technique. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 55161005 fits exactly. Parent concepts lack specificity, and siblings indicating release/excision are different actions. No child concept is invoked because no specific fascia is mentioned."
223712004,South American country (geographic location),South American country,"The main concept explicitly stated is a sovereign country within the continent of South America. This belongs to the SNOMED CT category Geographic location, and the most precise match is South American country (geographic location), SCTID 223712004. The wording does not specify any particular named country (which would be a child concept) nor broaden to a continent or region (which would be a parent or sibling concept like South America). It also avoids introducing attributes such as time, quantity, or associated conditions. The phrase is a direct use of the preferred term and therefore maps exactly to the given concept."
369283008,Entire lateral recess of fourth ventricle (body structure),Chart note: entire lateral recess of the fourth ventricle identified,"Main concept: documentation identifies the entire lateral recess of the fourth ventricle. Explicit attribute: “entire” emphasizes the whole structure; no laterality or condition specified. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 369283008 best fits, as the entry explicitly refers to the whole recess. Parent or unspecified structural concepts are less specific, and child/sibling entries such as right/left lateral recess or adjacent structures would add attributes not stated. The verb “identified” is contextual and does not change the anatomical entity."
447497003,Stagonopleura guttata (organism),Listed organism Stagonopleura guttata,"Stating ‘listed organism’ followed by the species name indicates only the organism concept and aligns with the SNOMED CT Organism category. No attributes such as exposure or disease are added. The exact species Stagonopleura guttata should be coded with SCTID 447497003, rather than broader or alternative taxa."
449205006,Nottingham histologic grading system (staging scale),Grading performed according to Nottingham histologic grading system,"The entry states that grading was carried out using the Nottingham histologic grading system, specifying the scale rather than an outcome. Category: Assessment scale (staging scale). It maps to the scale concept (449205006). A generic grading approach would be a parent concept, and grade-specific findings would be children, none of which are indicated here."
1365799003,Photographic intraoral direct image of left buccal segment with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),Record artifact: left buccal segment direct intraoral photo with teeth in centric relation.,"This statement explicitly labels the item as a record artifact and specifies a direct intraoral photographic image of the left buccal segment with teeth in centric relation. The main concept is an imaging record artifact with attributes: photographic modality, intraoral site, left buccal view, direct technique, and jaw relation (centric relation). The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and SCTID 1365799003 is the most precise mapping. Alternatives like broader intraoral photo artifacts or siblings such as right buccal or indirect mirror photos would be less accurate. The entry maintains fidelity to the FSN without adding extraneous attributes."
881310021000119100,Phenytoin taken at lower dose than instructed (finding),Phenytoin: patient taking below the directed dose,"The entry identifies phenytoin and the finding that the patient takes a dose below that which was directed, matching the notion of lower dose than instructed. The medical concept is a patient-level medication-use finding specific to phenytoin. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. SCTID 881310021000119100 is the most accurate because it encodes this precise underdosing relative to instructions for phenytoin. A generic parent like incorrect dose taken would be less specific, and siblings such as phenytoin omitted or taken at higher dose would not align. 'Directed dose' is a clinically equivalent synonym for 'instructed dose,' not altering the code."
705802004,Surgical drill handpiece (physical object),Handpiece for surgical drill,"This phrasing denotes the handpiece component intended for a surgical drill and is clinically equivalent to 'surgical drill handpiece.' The main concept is the handpiece itself. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It does not imply the full drill assembly, nor any specific attributes like specialty, power type, or sterility. Thus, it maps precisely to Surgical drill handpiece (705802004) and not to parent/sibling concepts such as surgical drill or dental drill handpiece."
458090002,Escherichia coli serogroup O7 (organism),Lab organism: Escherichia coli serogroup O7,"The entry labels the taxonomic entity in a laboratory context, naming E. coli with serogroup O7. Category: Organism. This corresponds precisely to the organism concept, not to a clinical finding or observation, since no presence/positivity or specimen site is asserted. A parent concept lacking serogroup detail would be less specific; siblings representing other O groups would be incorrect. The synonymic structure does not alter the code selection."
258576008,Suprapubic aspirate specimen (specimen),Sample type: suprapubic aspirate,"This documentation indicates the type of sample is a suprapubic aspirate, which is synonymous with a specimen designation. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, mapped to Suprapubic aspirate specimen (258576008). More general parent terms lack the suprapubic qualifier, and child or sibling terms that specify fluid type or catheterization introduce attributes absent from this entry. The use of 'sample type' is common and does not change the code."
6795009,"Spontaneous placental expulsion, function (observable entity)",Spontaneous placental expulsion function,"The entry names the observable physiological function of the placenta being expelled spontaneously, without implying a procedure or event. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. This precisely matches SCTID 6795009 because it refers to the function itself rather than a performed delivery or a disorder. Broader parents like placental expulsion function (without specifying spontaneity) would be less precise, and siblings such as induced or assisted expulsion functions would be inaccurate. The wording is a direct restatement of the preferred term and does not add attributes."
737435003,Malnutrition clinical management plan (record artifact),Malnutrition management plan stored in the record.,"The phrase confirms a recorded management plan for malnutrition, emphasizing a plan artifact. The main concept is the presence of a malnutrition clinical management plan; it does not add attributes such as severity or timing. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 737435003 is the precise code matching this documentation. Broader plan artifact codes would be less specific, and disorder/procedure codes describe different domains (condition or action) rather than the record artifact."
223875002,Dorsetshire (geographic location),From Dorsetshire,"Although the wording indicates origin, the only codable entity explicitly named is Dorsetshire itself. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. The preposition ‘from’ is contextual and does not alter the geographic concept, so SCTID 223875002 is the correct code. Coding a parent area (e.g., England) would be too broad, and choosing a child (e.g., a municipality within Dorsetshire) or sibling county would not reflect the text. No clinical attributes are introduced; the entry identifies the specific location."
216392008,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, bank (environment)",Follow-up note: prior accident/poisoning happened at the bank,"In follow-up documentation, the prior event location is identified as the bank, mapping directly to the bank place-of-occurrence environment concept. The SNOMED category is Environment or geographical location. A parent concept would lose bank specificity; siblings (home, street, park) are not supported by the text. No mechanism, severity, or timing beyond the fact of prior occurrence is introduced. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent representation of 'place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, bank', supporting SCTID 216392008."
312229007,Deuteron radiation (physical force),Deuteron beam (radiation),"This wording focuses on the radiation constituted by a beam of deuterons, without adding attributes such as exposure context or treatment intent. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 312229007 applies best because the particle specified is the deuteron; broader categories like particle radiation or ionizing radiation would not capture the specificity, and sibling particles (proton, neutron) would be incorrect. The parenthetical '(radiation)' clarifies the modality and is a clinically equivalent synonym to the concept."
217624000,Accident due to high air pressure from rapid descent in water while diving (event),Accident: high pressure from rapid descent in water while diving,"The concise phrasing still captures the essential elements: an accident characterized by high pressure from rapid descent in water during diving. Main concepts: accident, high pressure, rapid descent, water/diving context. Category: Event. SCTID 217624000 exactly matches this mechanism and setting. It is more specific than generic diving accident codes and does not imply outcomes. The brevity does not introduce or omit attributes that would lead to a parent or sibling concept."
28331006,Backdraft (physical force),Backdraught (physical force),"Main concept: backdraft, using British spelling and explicitly marked as a physical force. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. This is a direct synonym and precise representation of Backdraft (physical force), SCTID 28331006. More generic parents or alternative siblings (e.g., Explosion) would be less accurate. No severity, timing, or injury attributes are introduced."
80591003,"N-Acetyllactosaminide beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (substance)","Enzyme: n-acetyllactosaminide β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase","Prefacing with 'Enzyme:' maintains the reference to the same specific substance, emphasizing its nature without changing the concept. This clearly denotes the β-1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with n-acetyllactosaminide acceptor, mapping to SCTID 80591003 in the SNOMED CT Substance hierarchy. The label avoids broader parent categories and does not introduce an isoform child. The contextual tag does not add clinical attributes such as severity or timing; it remains a substance identification."
441927008,Time of patient arrival to location for anesthesia (observable entity),Clock time of arrival to the anesthesia area,"This entry identifies the clock time of arrival to a location for anesthesia, clearly an Observable entity. SNOMED CT 441927008 precisely covers 'time of patient arrival to location for anesthesia.' It does not suggest anesthesia start, incision time, or non-anesthesia locations. Parent concepts like general arrival time are too broad, and child/sibling concepts naming a specific site are not indicated by the wording. The term 'anesthesia area' is a clinically safe synonym for 'location for anesthesia.'"
82830000,"Robotic arm, device (physical object)",Equipment list entry: robotic arm device,"The context 'equipment list entry' does not alter the device identity; it remains a Physical object, Device. The core concept is a robotic arm device, which is the precise match to SNOMED CT 82830000. No usage, application, or patient-related attributes are introduced, so broader robotic equipment categories are not as specific and specialized subtypes (e.g., surgical camera arms) are not indicated by this wording."
223552000,West African country (geographic location),Country in West Africa,"This entry specifies a national-level geographic entity situated within West Africa, directly aligning with West African country (SCTID: 223552000). The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. No specific nation is named and no qualifiers (e.g., coastal, francophone) are introduced, so the concept remains at the correct granularity. A parent concept referring to West Africa as a region would not capture the 'country' level, and a child listing a specific nation would be more detailed than the text provides. The phrasing is a straightforward paraphrase and keeps code selection unchanged."
273961005,Butyrophenone (substance),Follow-up note: butyrophenone named,"In a follow-up context, the entry simply names the substance butyrophenone and does not add attributes such as dose, route, derivative class, product, assay, or clinical events. This aligns with SNOMED CT 273961005 (Substance). Broader parent concepts lack specificity, and sibling/child concepts (e.g., derivatives or medications) are not indicated. The appropriate code remains Butyrophenone (substance)."
1167355007,Dual energy X-ray photon absorptiometry heel scan T score (observable entity),DEXA calcaneal T-score,"This phrase denotes the T-score obtained via DEXA (a common synonym for DXA) at the calcaneus (heel). The observable is the T-score for a DXA heel scan. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 1167355007 fits because it encodes the heel site and the DXA method for a T-score. Parent concepts that lack anatomical site or method are too general, and sibling concepts such as calcaneal Z-scores or DXA at other skeletal sites are inappropriate. “DEXA” and “calcaneal” are clinically equivalent synonyms for DXA and heel, respectively, without introducing new attributes."
15496002,Public swimming pool (environment),Public swimming baths,"This UK-usage term refers to a publicly accessible swimming pool facility, making it a clinically equivalent environment expression. Category: Environment or geographical location. Public swimming pool (environment) [15496002] is the best match because 'swimming baths' in healthcare contexts denotes a swimming pool open to the public. It is more specific than the parent 'Swimming pool (environment)' and excludes private pool siblings. No additional attributes are introduced."
277512003,Eponymous serotypes U-Z (qualifier value),Eponymous U–Z serotype grouping,"The phrase denotes the U–Z grouping of eponymous serotypes, clearly a categorical qualifier rather than a disorder or observation result. It maps to the Qualifier value 277512003 because that code represents the eponymous serotypes U–Z range. More general or different letter groupings would be less precise or incorrect, and individual serotype names would be overly specific. 'Grouping' is a synonymous way to express a classification bucket and does not introduce new attributes beyond the qualifier value."
193775002,Entire first left posterolateral branch of circumflex branch of left coronary artery (body structure),Dissection note: entire first posterolateral branch from the left circumflex branch of the left coronary artery,"This describes the entire first posterolateral branch that emanates from the left circumflex (the circumflex branch of the LCA), including branch order and type. It is a Body structure. The specificity matches SCTID 193775002, distinguishing it from the general PL branches (parent) and from siblings such as second PL or OM branches. “Entire” ensures the whole named branch is intended, and “from” is a clinically equivalent synonym for origin without adding extra attributes."
261778002,Electrical frequency (physical force),Electric frequency,"The synonym ""electric frequency"" is a clinically equivalent way to denote the frequency of an electrical signal and is understood as the oscillation rate in hertz. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It maps directly to Electrical frequency (physical force) and avoids introducing context such as mains power or specific equipment. Parent categories would be less specific, and sibling concepts (voltage, current) are distinct electrical parameters. No additional attributes (numeric value, timing, cause) are present."
372665008,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (substance),Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent type (substance),"Using “agent type (substance)” clearly indicates the ingredient class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, matching SNOMED CT 372665008. There is no mention of administration, product forms, or dosing. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Parent anti-inflammatory classes are too general; children (specific NSAID substances) are not specified. This avoids any product interpretation and remains properly situated within the substance hierarchy."
5177007,Electrocardiographic axis finding (finding),Documented ECG axis finding,"Conveys that an axis finding has been documented on an ECG. Category: Clinical finding. It remains generic, not indicating left/right deviation, normal/abnormal, or which waveform’s axis is being referenced, making SCTID 5177007 the most precise match over broader or narrower alternatives."
242620008,Bite of large carnivore (event),Encounter reason—large carnivore bite,"This indicates the encounter is due to the event of a large carnivore bite. Category: Event. It does not specify species or add other attributes, aligning precisely with SNOMED CT 242620008. Using ‘encounter reason’ is contextual and does not change the underlying coded concept."
285337003,Radiant heat (physical force),Radiant heat documented,"This statement records the presence of the physical agent radiant heat without adding contextual attributes. Category: Physical force. It maps best to SCTID 285337003, avoiding broader heat concepts and differentiating from sibling forces such as hot objects or convection. Because no exposure or injury is implied, parent or child concepts are less appropriate than the specific radiant heat concept."
737358001,Open repair of obstructed incisional hernia (procedure),Clinic documentation: open incisional hernia repair with obstruction,"This clinic note entry identifies an open repair and specifies that the incisional hernia is obstructed. Main concepts: repair, open approach, incisional hernia, obstruction (expressed as 'with obstruction' which is clinically equivalent to 'obstructed'). SNOMED CT category: Procedure. Code 737358001 matches exactly. Parent concepts without obstruction and siblings with laparoscopic approach or strangulation/incarceration would be incorrect for this wording."
257724008,Urban main road (environment),History note setting: city main road,"“City main road” explicitly denotes an urban (city) main/primary road as the setting. The main concept is an environmental location. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location (environment). This is semantically equivalent to “Urban main road.” Parent terms like “City road” or “Urban area” are less specific, and siblings like “Rural main road” or “Urban street” would not match. The history note label is contextual and does not introduce new attributes to the environment."
264953006,Closure of fenestration of pleura (procedure),Operative procedure: closure of fenestration of pleura,"This explicitly names the operative procedure and mirrors the preferred term. The main concept is the surgical Procedure closing a pleural fenestration. It is more specific than parent categories like generic pleural procedures and avoids children focused on technique or location details. No extraneous attributes are added, ensuring the most precise match is SNOMED CT 264953006."
242308009,Accidental ingestion of alder buckthorn berries (event),"Patient statement: ""I accidentally ate alder buckthorn berries.""","This patient-reported wording clearly describes accidental eating (ingestion) of alder buckthorn berries. The concept is an exposure event with the intent accidental and the agent specified; no outcomes or timing details are introduced. It belongs to the Event category and maps to SCTID 242308009. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts implying poisoning or intentional ingestion would be inaccurate. The synonym ‘ate’ is equivalent to ingestion in this context and does not alter the code selection."
406094009,Number of mitoses per 10 high power fields (observable entity),Observable: number of mitoses per 10 HPF,"The entry explicitly labels the concept as an observable and states the number of mitoses per ten high-power fields, including the count property and 10 HPF denominator. It is an Observable entity and precisely fits SNOMED CT 406094009. Any parent without the denominator or sibling observables using different denominators or units would not match as specifically as this one."
260404005,Strong (qualifier value),Qualitative label: strong.,"This documents the qualitative label ""strong"" and introduces no additional clinical attributes beyond naming the value. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, making Strong (qualifier value) [260404005] the correct code. The context term ""Qualitative label"" does not alter the meaning; it remains the pure qualifier. Alternatives such as severity modifiers are not invoked, and siblings (e.g., moderate) are not mentioned. The mapping is appropriately specific to ""strong."""
111971002,Venous pressure outside reference range (finding),Venous pressure: outside normal limits,"The statement indicates venous pressure is beyond normal limits, with no further attributes. The core concept is a Clinical finding of venous pressure deviation from normal range. SNOMED CT 111971002 is the precise match since it reflects an out-of-range venous pressure result without specifying increase/decrease or central vs peripheral site. Parent categories would be overly broad, and direction-specific or site-specific children would be inappropriate given the neutral wording. The colon notation does not alter the clinical meaning."
69873004,Viscosity measurement (procedure),Viscosity evaluation,"An evaluation of viscosity denotes performing a measurement of viscosity. The concept is procedural and does not specify specimen or method. In SNOMED CT, this is categorized as a Procedure and maps to SCTID 69873004 Viscosity measurement (procedure). It is not a parent generic diagnostic procedure nor a child tied to a particular fluid. The synonym ""evaluation"" is equivalent to measurement in this context and does not introduce new attributes."
362017007,Entire septum primum (body structure),Septum primum,"The entry refers directly to the anatomical structure called the septum primum, with no added attributes such as pathology, timing, or modifiers. This is a Body structure in SNOMED CT, and the most precise match is Entire septum primum (body structure) SCTID 362017007. Broader parent concepts like interatrial/atrial septum or cardiac septum would be less specific, and sibling structures such as septum secundum or valve of foramen ovale are different entities. The term is the standard synonym for the FSN and does not change code selection."
1306662009,Photographic extraoral image of full face with lips closed and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),Frontal extraoral facial photo—full-face—lips closed; jaws positioned in centric relation,"The main concept is a frontal (full-face) extraoral photographic record, with explicit attributes of lips closed and centric relation for jaw positioning. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. The inclusion of each defining attribute makes this the best fit for SCTID 1306662009. It would be less appropriate to select a parent like “Extraoral facial photo” because that lacks full-face and positional details, or siblings indicating a profile view or different jaw relation (e.g., centric occlusion). ‘Frontal’ here is a synonym for full-face view and does not add or alter attributes."
104477004,Adipate measurement (procedure),Adipate assay,"An ‘assay’ denotes performing a test to measure adipate, which is a procedural activity. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the best match is 104477004 (Adipate measurement). The term does not specify specimen or technique and therefore does not map to a more detailed child concept. A parent concept would be overly generic, and an observable sibling would represent a variable or result rather than the assay itself. ‘Assay’ is a clinically accepted synonym for measurement in laboratory contexts and does not alter the intended concept."
242132008,Off-road land vehicle in collision with ridden animal (event),Impact between off-road land vehicle and animal being ridden,"The wording captures a collision (‘impact’) involving an off-road land vehicle and an animal that is being ridden, which matches the concept’s elements. The category is Event, and the best fit is SCTID 242132008. Parent concepts would be less specific by omitting the off-road or ridden attributes, while child concepts specifying particular vehicles (e.g., quad bike) or animals (e.g., horse) would be more detailed than stated. ‘Animal being ridden’ is a clinically equivalent synonym for ‘ridden animal.’"
1285052006,Insertion of dental bridge onto tooth (procedure),Install tooth-borne dental bridge,"This statement indicates installing (inserting/placing) a tooth-borne dental bridge, which falls under Procedure. ""Install"" is used colloquially in some notes but remains synonymous with clinical insertion. It excludes implant-supported bridges and does not add details like material or site. Broader or unrelated procedures (e.g., removable partial denture insertion) would be incorrect, so SCTID 1285052006 is the accurate mapping."
871501004,Allergy to chenodeoxycholic acid and/or ursodeoxycholic acid (finding),Documented allergy to ursodeoxycholic acid and/or chenodeoxycholic acid,"This sentence uses the explicit and/or construction and the full substance names, mirroring SNOMED CT 871501004. The main concept is a recorded allergy to UDCA or CDCA, with no added attributes, fitting the Clinical finding hierarchy. More general allergy concepts are insufficiently specific, and single-agent allergy concepts are too narrow compared with the and/or phrasing."
224022006,Quebec (geographic location),Quebec,"The entry is the unqualified place name “Quebec,” referring to the Canadian province as a geographic entity. Main concept: a province-level place. No attributes (such as time, relation, or clinical qualifiers) are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). SCTID 224022006 precisely represents the province of Quebec; choosing a parent like “Canada” would be overly broad, and a sibling/child like “Quebec City” would be overly specific and incorrect. The bare name is the canonical form and codes directly to the provincial geographic location."
52204003,Salmonella Romanby (organism),S. Romanby,"This is a standard abbreviated synonym for Salmonella Romanby, with 'S.' denoting the Salmonella genus and 'Romanby' the specific serovar. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It maps directly to SCTID 52204003 because it identifies the exact organism, not a parent group or another strain. The abbreviation does not change meaning or introduce attributes, so a broader parent concept or sibling serovar would be inaccurate."
766035009,History of difficult venous access (situation),Patient reports a history of difficult IV cannulation.,"This statement is patient-reported but still denotes historical difficulty with IV cannulation, which is clinically synonymous with venous access. As a Situation with explicit context, History of difficult venous access (situation) 766035009 fits best. Using a finding concept would be inaccurate because the phrasing is historical. The synonym 'IV cannulation' does not change the concept and avoids adding attributes like cause or severity."
21902005,Struck by falling rock or stone (event),Radiology referral reason: struck by falling stone,"The referral reason specifies being struck by a falling stone, which identifies both the object and the mechanism with no added injury or anatomical site. This is an Event. SNOMED CT 21902005 is the precise match as it covers being struck by a falling rock or stone. Parent concepts that only say falling object are overly general, and sibling concepts involving thrown stones or particular injuries are not supported by the text. The referral context is documentation and does not change the coded concept."
223912006,Isle of Man (geographic location),Facility location: Isle of Man,"The main concept is the geographic location named as the facility’s place. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223912006 matches the Isle of Man specifically. A parent (e.g., British Isles) or sibling (e.g., Channel Islands) would be inaccurate, and no sublocation is provided. The context ‘facility location’ does not change the coded concept from the place itself."
289035008,Ability to feed self with right hand (observable entity),Observed: able to self-feed with right hand.,The phrase indicates an observed ability to perform self-feeding using the right hand. This is an Observable entity capturing functional capacity. SCTID 289035008 fits exactly due to the combination of ability and right-hand specification. Parent concepts are too general by lacking laterality; siblings for left hand or for inability are not aligned with the wording. ‘Able’ is a valid synonym for the concept of ability without altering the coding.
223508008,African country (geographic location),Any African country,"This phrasing keeps the concept at the level of a sovereign country located in Africa without identifying a particular one. The main concept is a geographic location, category Geographic location. It does not introduce context like travel or residence. Coding to 'Country (geographic location)' would miss the continent specificity, and coding to a named country would add detail not present. Siblings for other continents are excluded. Use SCTID 223508008."
151111000119100,Yellow fever vaccination given (situation),Documentation of yellow fever vaccination given,"This entry indicates that documentation exists showing the yellow fever vaccination has been given, which expresses the completed immunization event without adding details like date or lot number. The concept is a situation of vaccination given, in the Situation with explicit context category. It maps to Yellow fever vaccination given (situation), SCTID 151111000119100, as it affirms the event occurred. Mentioning 'documentation' does not change the clinical concept or require a different code; it does not introduce child-level attributes or shift to status-only findings."
770573007,Airway endoscopy report (record artifact),Airway endoscopy report text,"Describing the report as “text” still denotes the document artifact for the airway endoscopy without adding clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps to SCTID 770573007 since the underlying concept is the airway endoscopy report itself. Coding to general endoscopy reports would be too broad; coding to specific airway procedure reports (e.g., bronchoscopy report) would be too narrow. The synonym does not change the intended code selection."
246558001,Cerebral dominance (observable entity),Brain hemispheric dominance (observable entity),"The wording indicates the observable entity that captures hemispheric dominance within the brain. It does not add values, laterality, or functional qualifiers and thus corresponds to the generic observable entity. More specific concepts (left/right or function-specific dominance) are excluded by the neutral phrasing, making SCTID 246558001 the correct and most precise code."
440700005,History of aortoiliac atherosclerosis (situation),Medical history lists aortoiliac atherosclerosis,"This entry indicates that aortoiliac atherosclerosis is part of the medical history, defining a historical situation. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It should be coded to SCTID 440700005 because it explicitly concerns past history of the specific vascular condition. Parent codes for history of atherosclerosis in general are too broad, and the active disorder or sibling concepts with occlusion/stenosis would be inaccurate. There are no added attributes like severity, laterality, or symptomatology."
223354003,Alderney (geographic location),Residence: Alderney,"“Residence” is a contextual label indicating the field where the location appears; the codable value is the place name “Alderney.” The concept remains a Geographic location (Location) and should be coded as Alderney (geographic location) SCTID 223354003. A parent region would be imprecise, and any sibling location would be incorrect. The context does not change the location identity or add clinical attributes; it simply describes usage (residence) for the same geographic concept."
82107009,Radiation (physical force),Radiation energy,"The concept described is radiation considered as energy, which is equivalent to radiation as a physical force. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and Radiation (physical force) [82107009] is the most precise match. No type of radiation, exposure event, or therapeutic use is mentioned, so children like Ionizing radiation or sibling concepts like Radiation exposure are less appropriate."
309221000,Terminal ileum resection specimen (specimen),Terminal ileum resection tissue specimen,"The entry indicates a tissue specimen from the terminal ileum obtained via resection. The medical concept is a resection specimen from the terminal ileum, belonging to the Specimen category. SCTID 309221000 matches exactly. Parent concepts that reference the ileum generally or small intestine resection are less specific, and biopsy/excision terms would be incorrect as they denote different collection methods. 'Tissue specimen' is a clinically typical descriptor and does not introduce new attributes beyond the defined specimen."
370447005,Galegine (substance),Galegine listed in components,"This indicates galegine as a component substance, maintaining focus on the specific chemical. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and Galegine (substance) SCTID 370447005 is the exact match. It does not specify a particular product, dosage, or formulation; therefore, product concepts are less appropriate. Parent classes are overly broad, and sibling substances are distinct entities."
410537005,Action status unknown (qualifier value),Action status recorded as unknown,"The wording indicates documentation of the qualifier ‘unknown’ applied to action status; this adds context but no new clinical attributes. It should be coded as the Qualifier value Action status unknown (410537005). The phrase remains specific to action status, avoiding general unknown qualifiers or other status values. Documentation phrasing does not change the underlying status meaning or use of the qualifier. Therefore, parent or sibling concepts are less appropriate than this precise match."
1258911006,Choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy of calculus of biliary tract (procedure),Choledochoscopic EHL of bile duct calculus.,"This is a concise statement of electrohydraulic lithotripsy performed choledochoscopically on a bile duct calculus. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The abbreviation EHL is standard for electrohydraulic lithotripsy and is clinically equivalent. It avoids specificity to a single duct (e.g., common bile duct) and excludes sibling techniques or approaches, making the given concept the most precise match."
860643007,No postural drop in blood pressure (situation),No reduction in blood pressure on position change.,"The phrase asserts that with a change in position, blood pressure is not reduced, directly encoding the absence of postural drop. Main concept: no decrease in BP with posture; attribute: position change context. SNOMED CT category: Situation. This most precisely maps to No postural drop in blood pressure (situation) [860643007]. Parent or sibling concepts that focus on hypotension or general BP responses would be less specific; the entry is absolute and singularly about the absence of a drop. The synonym ‘reduction’ is equivalent to ‘drop’ and does not alter code selection."
447407009,Specimen from necrotic tissue (specimen),Specimen from necrotic tissue,"The entry explicitly states a specimen that consists of necrotic tissue. The main concept is the specimen type, with the attribute being the tissue state (necrotic). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This matches exactly SCTID 447407009 'Specimen from necrotic tissue (specimen)'. More general parents like 'Tissue specimen' are too broad, and children or siblings that specify body site, method of collection, or cause are not indicated by the wording. The phrasing uses the preferred term, so it is a precise match without introducing additional attributes."
45893009,Cold weather (physical force),Cold weather conditions,"This phrasing expresses the same concept as 'cold weather,' focusing on meteorologic conditions being cold. Category: Physical force. The best match is SNOMED CT 45893009 because the term refers to weather rather than general environment or measured temperature. Parent 'weather' concepts are too general, and siblings like 'cold climate' or 'low ambient temperature' shift scope away from weather. The added word 'conditions' is a neutral descriptor and does not introduce new attributes."
76264001,Structure of anterior meniscofemoral ligament (body structure),Surgical anatomy: ligament of Humphrey,"This entry references the ligament of Humphrey in a surgical anatomy context, still denoting the anterior meniscofemoral ligament Body structure. The appropriate SNOMED CT concept is 'Structure of anterior meniscofemoral ligament' (SCTID 76264001). No additional attributes (injury, repair, laterality) are implied. It specifically points to the anterior variant, not the posterior Wrisberg ligament, and is more specific than generic meniscofemoral ligament."
1371374007,Site of vaccine product administration not appropriate (event),Vaccination delivered to the wrong body site,"This statement denotes that the vaccination was delivered to an incorrect body site, which is an event of inappropriate site selection. The SNOMED CT category is Event, and SCTID 1371374007 is the exact match given the vaccine-specific focus on site appropriateness. It does not introduce route or specific anatomy, avoiding drift to sibling or child concepts."
399440009,Specimen from ureter obtained by nephroureterectomy (specimen),"Pathology specimen — ureter, obtained at nephroureterectomy","In pathology report style, the entry indicates a ureter specimen and explicitly links procurement to nephroureterectomy. This places the term squarely in the Specimen category. A parent like ‘Specimen from ureter’ lacks the procedural qualifier, and siblings tied to other surgeries would not match. No timing, laterality, or condition modifiers are present, preserving exactness."
121738009,alpha-Aminoisobutyrate measurement (procedure),alpha-aminoisobutyrate test,"The wording conveys a laboratory test to measure alpha-aminoisobutyrate and does not introduce any specimen, interpretation, or timing attributes. It is a Procedure. SCTID 121738009 precisely fits because it identifies the measurement of alpha-aminoisobutyrate. More general parent procedures would be insufficiently specific, and any child or sibling that adds specimen or relates to a different analyte would not match this wording. ‘Test’ is a common synonym for measurement and is clinically equivalent."
411879001,Sunflower seed specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Sunflower seed allergen extract for testing,"The entry describes an allergen extract product used for testing, explicitly tied to sunflower seed. No mention of test type or dose is made. It belongs to the Product category. SCTID 411879001 is the most precise code as it represents sunflower seed specific diagnostic allergen extract. A parent diagnostic extract concept is overly broad, and siblings (e.g., pollen extracts or immunotherapy products) do not match the diagnostic testing intent and seed source."
3713005,Release for de Quervain's tenosynovitis of hand (procedure),Release of radial styloid tendon sheath for de Quervain's (hand),"This clarifies the anatomical focus—the radial styloid tendon sheath—released for de Quervain's in the hand. Category: Procedure. This is clinically synonymous with de Quervain's first dorsal compartment release and fits SNOMED CT 3713005. A parent like 'radial styloid tendon sheath release' without the disease context would be less specific. Siblings that reference wrist-only site or different interventions would not match. No extra attributes (laterality, timing, approach) are added."
80580005,Exposure to attack by marine animal (event),Reported exposure to attack by a marine animal,"The wording indicates that an exposure event to attack by a marine animal has been reported, without adding temporal qualifiers, species, mechanism, or injuries. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 80580005 is the most precise match because it captures the exposure to attack by marine animals. A more general parent would omit the marine qualifier, and a more specific child would introduce details not present here. The term 'reported' reflects documentation context and does not alter the underlying event concept."
411538007,House dust specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic extract—house dust allergen,"The wording presents a diagnostic extract tied to the house dust allergen, which is consistent with a house dust specific diagnostic allergen extract. The main concept is a diagnostic product. SNOMED CT category: Product. The dash-separated structure does not add attributes; it remains more specific than generic diagnostic extracts and excludes therapeutic forms or other allergen sources."
216357000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, baseball field (environment)",Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning: baseball field,"The main concept explicitly identifies the place of occurrence for an accident or poisoning as a baseball field. This aligns with SNOMED CT concept 216357000, which is categorized under Environment or geographical location and specifically denotes the baseball field as the environmental site where an accident or poisoning occurred. Choosing this code is more precise than the parent concept for place of occurrence of accident or poisoning (environment), and avoids siblings like sports field unspecified or football field. No additional attributes such as cause, severity, timing, or activity are introduced, making this the exact match."
223658005,West European country (geographic location),National state in Western Europe,"‘National state’ is a synonym for ‘country’; paired with ‘Western Europe,’ it represents West European country. The main concept is a country-level geographic location; no additional qualifiers are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. This selection is more specific than European country because of the western qualifier and avoids mapping to the regional Western Europe concept by keeping country granularity."
218023008,Accident caused by powered snow blower (event),Mechanism: powered snow blower accident,"The concept is documented as a mechanism of the event: an accident involving a powered snow blower. This is categorized as an Event and best coded as SCTID 218023008. The term adds no extra attributes about injuries, severity, location, or occupational context. Parent concepts like Accidental event are too generic, and siblings concerning other powered tools or nonpowered devices would not be appropriate. The 'mechanism' prefix is a common clinical context and does not alter the concept itself."
115497005,Albumin bound thyroxine (substance),Albumin-bound thyroxine (T4–albumin complex),"This entry provides both the preferred term and an explicit synonym phrase indicating the T4–albumin complex, clearly identifying the substance. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It is an exact match to SCTID 115497005 because it specifies albumin as the binding protein, excluding free T4 and other protein complexes like TBG-bound thyroxine. The synonym wording is clinically equivalent and does not introduce additional attributes."
223503004,North America (geographic location),Residence documented: North America,"Residence is a contextual label; the concept to encode is North America as the specified location. The main concept remains North America. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. North America (geographic location) SCTID 223503004 is the exact match. Broader geographic parents or alternative continental siblings (e.g., Europe, South America) do not fit the wording, and no country-level specificity (e.g., Canada) is present. The context does not introduce attributes that change the code."
183996000,Sterilization requested (situation),Patient requests permanent birth control method.,‘Permanent birth control’ denotes sterilization in clinical practice; the entry expresses a patient request without specifying method or sex. The appropriate code is SNOMED CT Sterilization requested (situation) 183996000. It is more specific than general contraception request and does not reflect a provider-initiated procedure request or any counseling/consent status.
427726005,Wisconsin (geographic location),Clinical location: Wisconsin,"The context label 'Clinical location' frames the data element but the coded entity remains the place 'Wisconsin.' The SNOMED CT category is Location; the concept Wisconsin (geographic location) is SCTID 427726005. No additional clinical attributes are expressed, avoiding drift to finding or event concepts. Broader parent geographies or narrower child localities are not suggested. Therefore, 427726005 is the most precise mapping for this entry."
360049003,Pancreatic duct prosthesis (physical object),Wirsung duct prosthesis,"“Wirsung duct” is a clinically accepted synonym for the pancreatic duct. The entry denoted a prosthesis for that duct, which is a physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 360049003 fits exactly. A parent term lacking the anatomical site is too broad, and children or siblings that specify device subtype (e.g., stent) or different ducts (e.g., bile duct) would be inaccurate. The anatomical synonym preserves equivalence and does not add attributes."
12141009,"Determination of outcome, death avoidable (finding)",Quality and safety review finding: death avoidable,"The context of a quality and safety review is given, but the substantive finding is that the death was avoidable, which matches Determination of outcome, death avoidable. This is a Clinical finding capturing a conclusion. It is not a Q&S procedure or root cause classification; it is the outcome determination itself. No cause, timing, or other attributes are added. It avoids broader parents and excludes siblings like unavoidable death, making the provided SNOMED concept the most precise fit."
258493006,Urinary bladder calculus specimen (specimen),Pathology specimen—bladder stone,"This entry frames the item explicitly as a pathology specimen and identifies it as a bladder stone, i.e., a urinary bladder calculus. Category: Specimen. The code for 'Urinary bladder calculus specimen' is the best fit because the material and bladder source are precise. Parent 'Urinary calculus specimen' is too general, and siblings for other sites do not match. The presence of 'specimen' distinguishes it from the disorder/finding of a bladder stone in a patient."
285483005,Difficulty performing lip rounding (finding),Difficulty rounding lips observed during evaluation,"This entry reports observed difficulty with the exact action of rounding the lips, without adding severity, cause, or timing beyond the evaluation context. It is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 285483005 is the most accurate match, as it encodes difficulty performing lip rounding. Parent concepts would be too broad, and sibling or child concepts like inability or different lip movements are not supported by the wording. The evaluation context is a documentation setting and does not affect the coding choice."
722242001,Gastrointestinal telemetric monitoring system receiver (physical object),Patient-reported: GI telemetry receiver,"Despite the patient-reported context, the entry identifies the GI telemetry receiver device itself. The concept is a Physical object. SCTID 722242001 is the exact match, as it denotes the gastrointestinal telemetric monitoring system receiver. Generic receivers or non-GI devices would be too broad, and sibling components (transmitters, sensors, recorders) would misclassify the role. The context label does not add attributes like malfunction or usage status; it simply frames the mention, leaving the device concept intact."
438804005,Tissue specimen from transplanted kidney (specimen),Kidney transplant graft tissue specimen,"The term 'kidney transplant graft' is a clinically standard way to refer to the transplanted kidney. Specifying 'tissue specimen' identifies the material. This aligns with SNOMED CT concept 438804005 in the Specimen category. It does not add collection method or clinical indications, so it should not be coded to method-specific children or to broader tissue specimen parents."
254291000,Staging and scales (staging scale),Staging scale framework,"This describes the scale as a framework for staging, still identifying the artifact of a staging scale without a specific name or result. The SNOMED CT category is Staging scale, and code 254291000 addresses the generic concept. It is not a better fit for general assessment scale categories or for any specific staging system. The term 'framework' is a descriptive paraphrase that does not alter the underlying concept or introduce attributes."
40446008,Physaloptera (organism),Identification: Physaloptera nematode,"The entry identifies the organism as a nematode and specifies the genus Physaloptera, keeping the concept at the organism/genus level. The term ‘nematode’ is a descriptive classifier and does not alter code selection because the genus is given. This excludes parent-level coding and child species, mapping best to SCTID 40446008."
16212931000119109,Specimen from cranium bone obtained by craniotomy (specimen),Specimen: cranium bone; obtained at craniotomy,"The entry identifies the specimen type (cranium bone) and the acquisition method (obtained at craniotomy), which precisely matches the target Specimen concept. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. A parent like “Specimen from cranium bone” omits the method, and a sibling like “Specimen from scalp obtained by craniotomy” would change the tissue. The concise phrasing remains uniquely codable to the concept without adding attributes such as laterality or diagnosis."
18213006,Electricity (physical force),Electricity as the physical force,"This wording explicitly frames electricity within the Physical force category, matching Electricity (physical force), SCTID 18213006. It avoids introducing context such as exposure, injury, or hazard. It does not narrow to measurable aspects (current, voltage) or devices. Thus, parent concepts are too broad, and related children/siblings are not indicated; the selected concept is the most precise fit."
224886008,Treatment room (environment),Treatment room,"The entry explicitly names the environment as a treatment room, which directly corresponds to SNOMED CT concept 224886008. The main concept is a physical care setting used for delivering treatment, with no added attributes such as department, specialty, or procedure type. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This is the most precise match because it specifies a treatment room, not a more general parent like Room (environment) nor a sibling such as Examination room, Procedure room, or Operating room. No synonym is used here; the wording is identical to the preferred term."
242637001,Bite of midge (event),ED intake: midge bite,"The concept recorded at ED intake is a midge bite, with no added details such as location, severity, timing, or number of bites. This corresponds to the Event category in SNOMED CT. Bite of midge (event), SCTID 242637001, is the most precise match due to explicit organism and event. A broader insect bite event would be less exact, and the text does not imply a disorder or injury code. Intake context is metadata and does not change the event coding."
56242006,"Light, electromagnetic radiation (physical force)",Noted agent: light (electromagnetic radiation),"The agent being noted is light, clarified as electromagnetic radiation, with no additional attributes implied. This is a Physical force in SNOMED CT and matches 56242006 exactly. It does not suggest broader coverage (electromagnetic radiation generally) nor specify a narrower subtype like UV or IR, keeping the mapping uniquely aligned with the intended concept."
429677001,History of arthroscopy of knee joint (situation),Intake: history of arthroscopy of knee joint,"During intake, this statement records that the patient previously underwent knee joint arthroscopy, with no laterality or additional attributes provided. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context. It maps directly to SCTID 429677001, which captures history of knee arthroscopy. Broader concepts (e.g., history of knee surgery) or different-site arthroscopy histories are less precise, and using a procedure concept would misstate the temporal context. The phrasing is a straightforward synonym preserving code intent."
443601000124107,Modular carbohydrate formula component (product),Modular component for formula — carbohydrate,"This indicates a product that is a modular component for a formula, specified as carbohydrate. Category: Product. It aligns most precisely with 443601000124107. A broader parent like 'Formula component' lacks the carbohydrate designation, while a child would have a specific carbohydrate subtype. Siblings (protein/fat modular components) are excluded by the explicit carbohydrate wording. The synonym keeps the same clinical meaning."
16214691000119105,Specimen obtained from breast by ultrasound guided needle biopsy (specimen),"Laboratory specimen: breast, ultrasound-guided needle biopsy","The entry labels a laboratory specimen sourced from the breast and collected by ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. As a Specimen concept, this is precisely the SNOMED CT target. The lab context does not change the clinical attributes. It remains more specific than general breast specimens and avoids the over-specificity of core/FNA children or different guidance siblings. It clearly is not a procedure entry."
1217119006,Drug-coated coronary artery stent (product),"Stent—coronary artery, drug-coated","This entry expresses a stent intended for the coronary artery with a drug coating, matching the FSN attributes. The main concept is a device product: coronary stent with drug coating. SNOMED CT category: Product (device). It is not a generic coronary stent (parent) and is not a particular drug-eluting subtype (child). No additional attributes like timing, laterality, or implantation status are included, so it remains codable to the product."
448850006,Genus Mellivora (organism),Catalog entry: Mellivora genus,"The catalog context is administrative, while the core concept is the genus Mellivora. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No additional biological attributes are introduced, and the rank is clearly genus. A species code such as Mellivora capensis would be too narrow, and higher taxa too broad. The precise match remains SCTID 448850006."
371528001,Pathology report (record artifact),Path report,"This is a common clinical shorthand for a pathology report and refers to the same record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, and the most precise match is 371528001 Pathology report (record artifact). Although abbreviated, the phrase does not imply a different subtype (e.g., histology, cytology) and does not add scope beyond pathology, so parent concepts like Laboratory report are less accurate. It is not a finding or result entity; it denotes the document itself, maintaining equivalence to the preferred term."
387560008,Alfentanil (substance),Toxicology analyte name: alfentanil,"Naming alfentanil as the analyte focuses on the substance being measured or targeted, not on results or procedures. The SNOMED CT category is Substance; Alfentanil (substance) 387560008 is most precise. Observable or finding concepts would apply if a measurement or detection result were stated, which is not the case here."
14890006,"Small intestine secretion, function (observable entity)",Small intestine secretion function (physiologic),"The parenthetical “physiologic” clarifies the nature of the function without changing meaning, maintaining the focus on the small intestine’s secretory function as an Observable entity. This maps to SNOMED CT 14890006 and does not indicate a test, procedure, or result. Broader intestinal secretion functions or narrower segment-specific functions are not appropriate given the scope. Sibling observables for absorption or motility are separate physiologic domains. The entry avoids any attribute modifiers, ensuring precise coding."
1299103002,Pediatric wheelchair (physical object),Pediatric wheelchair,"The main concept is a wheelchair specifically designed for pediatric patients. This is a Physical object in SNOMED CT, corresponding to Pediatric wheelchair (SCTID 1299103002). The wording precisely matches the device subtype with pediatric sizing and design, without specifying manual vs powered or any special features. Using the parent concept Wheelchair (physical object) would lose the pediatric specificity, and child/sibling concepts such as powered pediatric wheelchair or manual pediatric wheelchair would be over-specific given no such attribute is stated."
242930001,Assault by physical restraint (event),Forensic documentation: assault by physical restraint,"The entry specifies the assault mechanism as physical restraint in a forensic context, still focusing solely on the event. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It maps to SCTID 242930001, more precise than general assault and not suggesting alternative mechanisms. The context label does not add attributes that would shift to different SNOMED concepts."
69457004,Candida albicans aspartic proteinase (substance),C. albicans aspartyl protease,"This phrase names the same enzyme substance, using standard abbreviation and the synonym “aspartyl protease” for aspartic proteinase. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 69457004 is the most accurate match. Parent concepts lacking species or enzyme class detail are too broad, and child concepts (distinct SAP isoenzymes) are not specified. Other protease classes (e.g., serine or metalloproteases) would be sibling concepts and are not suggested by the entry."
42061000087105,Combined specimen from swab of anterior naris and axillary fossa and inguinal region (specimen),"Lab specimen type: combined swab of anterior naris, axillary fossa, inguinal region","The entry declares the lab specimen type as a combined swab involving the anterior naris, axillary fossa, and inguinal region, directly corresponding to SCTID 42061000087105 (Specimen). The phrase remains confined to specimen source specification without new attributes. It is more precise than parent categories of combined specimens without site details and does not align better with siblings specifying other site sets."
170370000,Administration of first dose of vaccine product containing only Hepatitis B virus antigen (procedure),Follow-up: first dose of HBV-only vaccination documented as administered,This follow-up note confirms that the first dose of an HBV-only (monovalent) vaccination was administered. The concept is a Procedure. The 'first dose' attribute aligns with the dose-specific nature of the code and excludes siblings for subsequent doses. 'HBV-only' ensures it is not a combination product. A generic parent without dose specificity is less precise given the wording. The context ('Follow-up') does not introduce new clinical attributes; it simply indicates documentation timing. SCTID 170370000 is the most accurate code selection.
416774000,Scheduled - priority (qualifier value),Priority: scheduled,"The entry explicitly states a priority value of 'scheduled', which is a qualifier applied to requests, orders, or tasks. The main concept is the priority classification itself; no additional attributes such as urgency level, timing beyond the value label, or clinical context are added. This fits the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value and maps most precisely to Scheduled - priority (qualifier value) (416774000). More general parents like Priority (qualifier value) would be too broad, and siblings such as Urgent - priority or Routine - priority do not match the wording. The phrasing is a direct expression of the scheduled priority value and does not alter the code selection."
767235005,Gadolinium compound (substance),Noted material: gadolinium compound,"This entry designates the material as a gadolinium-containing compound, which codes to SNOMED CT 'Gadolinium compound' (767235005, Substance). The context does not add attributes that would shift coding to contrast agents or specific named gadolinium derivatives. Because the term clearly indicates a compound and not the element alone, parent concepts like 'Gadolinium (substance)' are less precise than the selected compound class."
411573009,Cat serum albumin diagnostic allergen extract (product),Panel item: cat albumin diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry situates the product as part of a diagnostic panel while specifying it is a cat albumin diagnostic allergen extract, which matches the product concept. The main concept is the diagnostic product; no test results or modality are added. Category: Product. It avoids broader cat allergen mixes and unrelated cat components, and it is more specific than general albumin extract parents. The synonym “cat albumin” is equivalent to cat serum albumin, maintaining the same code."
46316000,Cosmic radiation (physical force),Patient statement includes cosmic radiation,"This patient-reported context includes cosmic radiation by name, without attributes like risk or exposure. The concept is still the physical force. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. SCTID 46316000 is the most accurate match; parent or sibling radiation concepts are not indicated. The phrasing does not introduce a different concept; it remains cosmic radiation."
19215005,Entire left renal artery (body structure),Left renal artery (body structure),"The entry explicitly denotes the anatomical category and the specific vessel: left renal artery. The main concept is an anatomical body structure, and it precisely corresponds to SNOMED CT Entire left renal artery (SCTID: 19215005). It is more exact than the parent Renal artery due to laterality and does not imply a branch or segment, avoiding child concepts. The parenthetical ‘body structure’ reiterates the category without changing meaning."
16212811000119105,Tissue specimen from donor cornea (specimen),Pathology specimen: donor corneal tissue,"The entry indicates a pathology specimen whose type is donor corneal tissue. The main concept is a specimen of corneal tissue from a donor. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This aligns with “Tissue specimen from donor cornea.” The “pathology specimen” context is a reporting label and does not change the specimen’s identity or add attributes. Broader corneal specimen codes without donor origin would be less precise, and other ocular tissues would be anatomically inaccurate."
120815006,Antibody to Human coxsackievirus B5 (substance),Report reference to the coxsackievirus B5 antibody,"The entry indicates that a report references the antibody specific to coxsackievirus B5, but it does not provide measurement, status, or isotype attributes. This fits the SNOMED CT Substance category. The most accurate code is 120815006 Antibody to Human coxsackievirus B5 (substance). Assigning a procedure or observation finding code would be inappropriate because only the substance is identified. Broader parents or serotype-mismatched siblings would not reflect the precise B5 specificity."
445364004,Swab of axilla (specimen),Specimen identifier: axillary swab,"This indicates the specimen’s identifier corresponds to an axillary swab. It remains a Specimen and matches Swab of axilla (specimen), SCTID 445364004. The adjective “axillary” is equivalent to “of the axilla.” No added attributes are present. Parent swab specimen is too broad; siblings for other sites do not fit the specified axilla source."
870687002,Difficulty managing residence-related activities (finding),Trouble managing home-related tasks,"This entry uses the synonym “trouble” to convey the same idea as “difficulty,” focused on tasks related to the home/residence. The main concept is functional difficulty in managing residence-related tasks, without introducing severity, cause, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. It aligns best with 870687002 because it refers generally to home-related management activities, not to a specific subtask. Parent concepts about general ADLs are too broad, and sibling concepts like housing instability or inability to perform personal care are not implied. The synonym “trouble” is clinically equivalent to “difficulty” and does not change the code selection."
736353004,Inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient care plan maintained,"The phrase references the ongoing existence of a documented inpatient care plan within the record, highlighting a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It should be coded to Inpatient care plan (record artifact) because the inpatient setting is explicit. Parent or sibling concepts would either be too general or imply different settings or roles not stated. The wording does not add clinical attributes; it simply affirms the artifact’s presence."
293665008,Allergy to magnesium trisilicate (finding),Magnesium trisilicate noted as an allergy,"The entry denotes that magnesium trisilicate is on the allergy list, capturing the Clinical finding of allergy to that substance. SCTID 293665008 is precise for this allergen. Parents are too generic; siblings like antacid allergy or magnesium allergy would be broader or different. No reaction details are given, so child concepts describing specific manifestations are not applicable."
737427001,Clinical management plan (record artifact),Discharge paperwork includes a clinical management plan,"This statement situates the clinical management plan within discharge paperwork, indicating its presence as a documented artifact without adding clinical details or time-based attributes beyond context. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. Clinical management plan (record artifact) [737427001] is the most precise code since it names the plan as a record artifact. A parent Record artifact would be less specific, and sibling artifacts such as Care plan or Treatment plan are not referenced. The discharge context does not alter the core concept."
721916007,Physician consulting initial evaluation note (record artifact),Consulting MD initial evaluation note,‘MD’ is a common synonym for physician and does not alter the concept; the entry describes a record artifact documenting an initial evaluation by a consulting physician. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This best matches SCTID 721916007 because it is the specific physician consulting initial evaluation note. A parent concept like initial evaluation note without consulting or author specification would be less precise; sibling concepts like subsequent consult notes or reports would represent different document types or times.
272081000,Unit of energy expenditure (qualifier value),Reporting unit for energy expenditure,"This entry conveys that the unit being referenced is the one used to report energy expenditure, without naming the unit itself or adding additional qualifiers. As a unit descriptor, it is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT. The most precise concept match is Unit of energy expenditure, which defines the unit dimension for reporting energy expenditure measurements. Using the parent Unit of measure would lose specificity, and a sibling like Unit of energy would be inaccurate because it does not imply expenditure. Any named unit (e.g., kcal/d) would move to a child-level unit concept and is deliberately not introduced, preserving the correct abstraction."
863993005,Nintedanib esilate (substance),Nintedanib esilate (substance),"This entry restates the concept with its hierarchy designation, directly naming the substance Nintedanib esilate. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It avoids any product-level attributes and is more specific than the parent “nintedanib (substance)” by specifying the salt. Sibling medicinal products or dose forms are not implied. Hence, the exact match is Nintedanib esilate (substance)."
11345007,Tribromsalan (substance),Chemical: tribromsalan,"The phrase identifies the item as a chemical and names it Tribromsalan, keeping the focus on the substance itself. Category: Substance. No dosage form, brand, or clinical context (e.g., administration or allergy) is given, so the precise code is Tribromsalan (11345007). Broader chemical families or function-based concepts are not indicated, and similar-sounding siblings (e.g., triclosan) are not referenced, ensuring unambiguous mapping to the specific substance."
1376032007,Squash vegetable (substance),Grocery item documented: squash vegetable,"As a grocery item, ‘squash vegetable’ denotes the edible squash substance, which is a SNOMED CT Substance. The wording lacks added attributes such as preparation, cultivar, or clinical context. Squash vegetable (substance), SCTID 1376032007, is the most accurate code. Parent categories are overly broad, while child/sibling concepts detailing specific types would not be supported. The grocery setting simply references the same substance."
736394007,Cystoscopy care plan (record artifact),Cystoscopy care plan present,"This entry asserts the presence of a care plan for cystoscopy, referring to the artifact’s existence rather than any action. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The wording aligns with “Cystoscopy care plan (record artifact)” and avoids implying orders, scheduling, or the procedure itself. A parent generic care plan would be less specific, and siblings like procedural, order, or planned situation concepts do not fit the artifact-focused statement."
176319004,Cryotherapy to prostate via perineal probe (procedure),Discharge summary: perineal probe cryotherapy to the prostate,"The discharge context records the procedure as cryotherapy to the prostate via perineal probe. Category: Procedure. Contextual labels do not alter the coded concept; crucially, the perineal probe approach is present, maintaining specificity. There is no mention of attributes that would shift coding to history or planned procedure concepts. Thus, it maps accurately to Cryotherapy to prostate via perineal probe rather than a parent or sibling."
1141821002,Flexible video bronchoscope (physical object),Bronchial videoscope (flexible),"The phrase identifies a video scope intended for the bronchi and explicitly states flexibility. This is a Physical object. The correct code is SCTID 1141821002 Flexible video bronchoscope, as it indicates the bronchoscope's target anatomy (bronchial), technology (video), and form factor (flexible). More general video endoscopes or non-flexible/ non-bronchial scopes are less specific and therefore less appropriate."
348519002,Hospital quality absorbent cotton (physical object),Hospital-quality absorbent cotton stock,"The word 'stock' provides inventory context but the coded object is hospital-quality absorbent cotton. Category: Physical object. The exact mapping is SCTID 348519002. Parent codes would omit the quality grade, and siblings that refer to different cotton products or sterilization states are not supported by the entry, ensuring this concept is the most precise."
257684001,Railway running on roadway (environment),Roadway hosting on-road railway,"The phrase states that the roadway hosts an on-road railway, meaning the railway operates on the road surface. Main concept: roadway-based rail environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This is equivalent to 'railway running on roadway' and maps to SCTID 257684001. Parent concepts are too general, and related but different settings (e.g., crossings) are not implied. No additional attributes beyond the environment are introduced."
32757009,Dibenzepin (substance),Dibenzepin is the named substance,"The statement clarifies that Dibenzepin is the named substance, containing no mention of dosage, formulation, brand, or administration. The category is Substance in SNOMED CT. Dibenzepin (substance), SCTID 32757009, is the precise match. Broader drug class or product concepts would be inappropriate since the entry isolates the chemical identity, and there is no additional qualifier pointing to a more specific derivative."
386132006,Ablation frequency (observable entity),Chart entry: ablation frequency,"This is a documentation context highlighting the ablation frequency parameter. The category is Observable entity. It aligns with Ablation frequency (386132006) because the frequency tied to ablation is the observable being recorded. There are no values, timing qualifiers, or other attributes that would make a parent or sibling concept more suitable."
257656006,Penal institution (environment),Documented environment = penal institution,"The stated concept is the environment documented as a penal institution, mapping to SNOMED CT 257656006 (Environment or geographical location). The phrasing indicates recording but does not alter the environmental concept itself or introduce additional clinical attributes. It is not restricted to a child concept like “prison (environment)” and is more specific than parent concepts like “institution (environment).”"
235546009,Burhenne's gallstone extraction (procedure),Record entry — Burhenne method for gallstone extraction,"The entry restates the eponymous technique as a record entry: 'Burhenne method for gallstone extraction.' Main concept: Burhenne technique for removing gallstones. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It aligns with SCTID 235546009 because the eponym and action are specified. Parent concepts not specifying the method are less precise, and siblings that indicate alternative procedures do not match. The record context and phrasing do not alter the clinical meaning or introduce extra attributes."
710260005,Class Wallemiomycetes (organism),Wallemiomycetes (organism class entry),"This phrasing presents Wallemiomycetes as an organism class entry, and does not introduce detection, infection, or sample source. It fits the Organism hierarchy and is precisely Class Wallemiomycetes (organism), SCTID 710260005. Parent concepts are too broad and child/sibling taxa would misalign with the class-level focus. The wording is a safe synonym of the preferred term."
722821009,Structure of tendon and/or tendon sheath within right elbow region (body structure),Right elbow region tendinous structures and tendon sheaths,"This entry specifies tendinous structures (a clinically equivalent term for tendons) together with tendon sheaths, located in the right elbow region. It solely indicates anatomy with laterality and site and belongs to the Body structure hierarchy. It maps best to SCTID 722821009 because it captures the 'tendon and/or tendon sheath' union within the right elbow region. A parent concept would be too general, and a child focusing exclusively on tendon or sheath would not reflect the combined scope implied here; the synonym 'tendinous structures' does not change the intended code."
300345006,Small gallbladder (finding),GB small,"‘GB’ is a common abbreviation for gallbladder; the entry denotes the finding that the gallbladder is small. This cleanly maps to Small gallbladder (finding) [300345006], category Clinical finding. No other attributes are introduced, so parent concepts are overly broad and sibling concepts such as collapsed or hypoplastic gallbladder are not indicated. The abbreviation does not change the clinical meaning and remains equivalent to ‘small gallbladder.’"
223814008,Tipperary (geographic location),Service location: Tipperary,"The phrase frames Tipperary as the location of service, but the coded concept is purely the geographic place name. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The correct code is 223814008 “Tipperary (geographic location).” Choosing a parent concept would be too general, and selecting child concepts such as administrative areas (county/town) would introduce specificity not given. The service context does not change the semantic target—the location itself—so the generic place name code is required."
699854004,Funeral home (environment),Setting: funeral home,"The entry identifies the setting as a funeral home, with no added attributes such as timing or cause. Category: Environment or geographical location. It maps precisely to SCTID 699854004 since it denotes the specific environment. Broader setting concepts or different locales (cemetery, church, mortuary) are not suggested by the wording. The label 'Setting:' is a contextual wrapper and does not change the concept."
30629002,Retirement home (environment),Residence: retirement home,"This documentation line assigns the residence environment as a retirement home. The main concept is the place of residence. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. ‘Retirement home’ aligns precisely with Retirement home (environment), SCTID 30629002. Using a broader parent would reduce specificity, and related siblings (e.g., nursing home, assisted living facility) would introduce care-level distinctions not present. The colon format simply indicates setting and does not change the semantics; therefore, 30629002 is the correct code."
216017008,"Collision of aircraft with another aircraft, while in transit, member of ground crew or airline employee injured (event)",Documentation: injury sustained by ground crew during aircraft-to-aircraft collision while in transit,"The documented event is an aircraft-to-aircraft collision occurring while in transit, with injury sustained by a ground crew member. This corresponds to SNOMED CT Event SCTID 216017008, which explicitly includes the collision counterpart, the in-transit condition, and the injured party category (ground crew/airline employee). More general accident codes or sibling concepts concerning passengers or non-aircraft collisions would be less precise. The terminology is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not add any modifiers beyond those encoded."
772790007,Organ donor card (record artifact),Organ donor card reviewed in chart audit.,"The entry indicates the organ donor card was reviewed in an audit, maintaining focus on the record artifact. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Organ donor card (772790007) precisely fits. It does not imply broader status findings or alternate artifacts such as registry records or consent forms. The synonym use is direct and does not introduce new attributes."
1304234009,Withdrawn from clinical trial (finding),Follow-up note: withdrawn from clinical trial.,"In a follow-up context, this indicates the patient is withdrawn from a clinical trial, matching Withdrawn from clinical trial (finding) [1304234009]. Category: Clinical finding. The context label does not introduce new attributes; it remains a pure status. It differs from completion or suspension statuses and is narrower than generic research study withdrawal, maintaining precise coding."
280952003,Entire optic tract (body structure),The entire optic tract,"This straightforward phrasing unambiguously denotes the whole optic tract and avoids any additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It corresponds exactly to 280952003 (Entire optic tract). Parent-level concepts lack the explicit completeness, while child concepts (e.g., left/right optic tract) add details not present. Sibling structures of the visual pathway are not referenced."
368399008,Entire skin between index finger and middle finger (body structure),Exam focus: skin between index and middle finger,"The contextual prefix 'Exam focus' does not change the anatomical site being referenced, which remains the skin between the index and middle fingers. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure (Anatomical structure). It matches 'Entire skin between index finger and middle finger (368399008)'. It is narrower than 'skin of hand' and not a different interdigital area, ensuring it does not drift to parent or sibling concepts."
719747008,Able to remember routines (finding),Able to remember routines,"The entry explicitly expresses a positive cognitive ability: remembering routines. The main medical concept is the capability to recall established routines, with no added qualifiers for cause, severity, timing, or associated conditions. This is a Clinical finding. The most precise SNOMED CT match is Able to remember routines (finding), SCTID 719747008, because it directly encodes the presence of this specific memory capability. A broader parent such as Able to remember (finding) would be less specific, and any sibling or child concept (e.g., inability to remember routines or remembering other domains) would not reflect the wording. The phrasing is a direct restatement and remains semantically equivalent."
469656000,Film-badge radiation dosimeter (physical object),Badge-type film radiation dosimeter,"The entry describes a radiation dosimeter of the badge-type that uses film, i.e., the film-badge radiation dosimeter. The main concept is a physical object for radiation dosimetry. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. This is the best match to SCTID 469656000 because it specifies both the badge form and film medium. A generic dosimeter (parent) would be less precise, and other badge-type dosimeters (siblings, e.g., electronic) are not indicated. The paraphrase stays within the same device identity without adding attributes."
278031001,Entire superior mesenteric vein (body structure),Anatomy: superior mesenteric vein,"The entry labels the anatomical site of interest as the superior mesenteric vein, with no added qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and the correct concept is SCTID 278031001 (Entire superior mesenteric vein). More general parents like 'Mesenteric venous structure' would be overly broad, whereas children specifying parts or segments of the SMV would be too specific. The 'Anatomy:' prefix merely sets context and does not alter the structure being identified."
309967005,Surgical department (environment),The surgical department,"This phrasing identifies the same environment: the department where surgical care is managed, without implying a ward, clinic, or operating room. It maps to Surgical department (environment) 309967005 under Environment or geographical location. There are no extra clinical attributes (e.g., admission status or specialty subsets). Broader parents like hospital department are less specific, and siblings like surgical ward/OR are different spaces. The definite article does not change the concept."
21317002,Sodium fluoroacetate (substance),Sodium salt of fluoroacetic acid,"This entry describes the sodium salt of fluoroacetic acid, which is the chemical sodium fluoroacetate. The concept type is Substance, and the closest match is Sodium fluoroacetate (SCTID 21317002). No mention of toxicity, exposure, formulation, or dose is made; only the substance identity is expressed. Generic parent concepts and different salt forms would be less appropriate, while this phrasing pins down the exact sodium salt. As a direct chemical synonym, it maintains the same code selection."
275670009,Prescription exemption certificate (record artifact),Registration note: prescription exemption certificate,"At registration, the referenced item is clearly the prescription exemption certificate document. The category is Record artifact. SCTID 275670009 perfectly fits. Using a generic certificate artifact would be less specific, and using a finding of exemption would change the class of concept. No particular subtype or reason is named, so child concepts are not a better match."
390914001,Thrombolytic therapy declined (situation),Patient preference: decline of thrombolysis,"This wording emphasizes patient preference resulting in declination of thrombolysis, synonymous with refusal of the therapy. No additional attributes are included. The SNOMED category is Situation with explicit context. The concept 390914001 is the most precise match, avoiding broader 'procedure declined' and distinct contexts like 'not done for clinical reasons.'"
714353007,Assessment using Child Group Session Rating Scale (procedure),Patient statement: 'I completed the Child Group Session Rating Scale.',"The content indicates completion of the Child Group Session Rating Scale by the patient, with no added attributes beyond a patient-reported context. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. 'Completed' is synonymous with administration of the instrument. SCTID 714353007 is the precise match because it identifies the specific child-group scale. Parent concepts (unspecified session rating scales) and sibling concepts (child-only or group-only SRS) would be less accurate than the explicitly named child-group measure."
15311000087107,Computed tomography of left scaphoid (procedure),Left scaphoid computed tomography,"A direct phrasing of the modality and target: computed tomography of the left scaphoid. The attributes present are modality (CT), site (scaphoid), and laterality (left), classifying it as a Procedure. It precisely matches SNOMED CT “Computed tomography of left scaphoid,” SCTID 15311000087107. Broader or different-site imaging, as well as other modalities, are not suggested. The absence of any technique qualifiers or timing ensures it does not map to parent/sibling/child alternatives."
180698000,Postauricular flap (substance),Flap sourced from the postauricular site,"This narrative identifies the flap's source as the postauricular site, which specifies the material without procedural details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The most precise mapping is to Postauricular flap (substance), SCTID 180698000. Generic flap substance parents are too broad, and siblings with different anatomical sources would not fit. The entry avoids adding attributes such as laterality, timing, or technique type."
66028006,Zu cristatus (organism),Recorded taxon: Zu cristatus,"This indicates the taxon recorded is Zu cristatus, which corresponds precisely to the SNOMED CT Organism concept Zu cristatus (SCTID: 66028006). Category: Organism. The phrase adds no additional clinical attributes. A parent taxon (e.g., genus Zu) or different species would be less precise than the specific species-level concept."
270865003,Curator bonis certificate (record artifact),Curator bonis appointment certificate,"The main concept remains a certificate, with wording that clarifies it pertains to the appointment of a curator bonis, which is inherent to such a certificate. No alternate legal instrument (e.g., order or decree) is implied; the phrasing keeps the document type as a certificate. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and maps directly to Curator bonis certificate (record artifact) SCTID 270865003. A parent concept like “appointment document” is too generic, and a sibling such as “court order appointing curator bonis” would be a different artifact type. The synonym is clinically equivalent because it specifies the same certificate purpose without changing attributes."
110308008,Group function in lateral excursion of teeth (observable entity),Working occlusal guidance: group function in lateral excursion,"This states that the working occlusal guidance during lateral excursion is group function, referring to the standard occlusal scheme where multiple teeth guide the movement. The main concept is group function during lateral excursion; no laterality, severity, or cause is introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. SCTID 110308008 is the specific match; broader observables would not indicate the scheme, and canine guidance as a sibling would be a different guidance type. 'Working occlusal guidance' is a common clinical paraphrase for guidance during lateral excursion and remains equivalent."
223513007,Morocco (geographic location),Morocco,"The entry states the country name Morocco with no qualifiers. The main concept is the nation-state Morocco as a geographic entity. Category: Geographic location (Location). This is an exact match to SNOMED CT 223513007 Morocco (geographic location). Parent concepts such as Africa (continent) are too broad, while child or sibling concepts like Rabat or Algeria are different places. No attributes (cause, severity, timing, laterality, extent, or associated conditions) are introduced, so the base country concept is the most precise code."
1303926004,Neurological physical therapy specialty (qualifier value),Patient preference: neuro PT specialty,"The phrase notes a patient preference for the neuro PT specialty, which refers to the 'Neurological physical therapy specialty' (SCTID 1303926004). The main concept is the PT specialty designation; 'neuro PT' is accepted shorthand. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. The context of preference does not add clinical attributes like procedure or diagnosis. General PT specialty or other PT specialties are less accurate. It is distinct from physician neurology. The specialization wording precisely maps to the qualifier."
224804009,Rural environment (environment),Countryside environment,"‘Countryside’ is commonly used as a clinically safe synonym for ‘rural,’ designating an environmental context. This maps to Rural environment (environment) [224804009]. The main concept is the environment type; there are no added attributes such as residence or timing. The SNOMED category is Environment. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings like urban/remote are not indicated. ‘Countryside’ does not introduce agricultural or occupational specifics, so a more specific child like agricultural environment would be inappropriate."
85992001,Myxoma virus (organism),Taxonomic organism recorded: Myxoma virus,"The entry records the organism’s taxonomic species as Myxoma virus, which belongs to the Organism hierarchy and matches SCTID 85992001. No extra clinical attributes are introduced. Broader taxonomic parents (genus/family) would be less precise, and child strains or sibling species would fail to represent this specific organism."
213771004,Train accident involving collision with rolling stock (event),Train accident due to collision with rolling stock,This phrasing expresses causation within the accident context: the train accident occurred due to a collision with rolling stock. Main concept: train accident involving collision with rolling stock. Category: Event. “Due to” reiterates the collision mechanism and does not add extra attributes. It differentiates from broader train accidents and excludes other types like derailments. SCTID 213771004 is therefore the most precise code.
223638009,Hungary (geographic location),Travel destination: Hungary,"Hungary is presented purely as the destination location; the concept being coded is the country as a geographic entity. The SNOMED CT category is Location (geographic location). SCTID 223638009 precisely denotes Hungary. Parent concepts like Country are overly broad, while children (e.g., Budapest) or siblings (other countries) are not indicated. The travel context does not add attributes to the location itself."
59776000,Calcium cyanide (substance),Identified substance: calcium cyanide (Ca(CN)2).,"This states the identified substance and includes both the name and formula, unequivocally indicating calcium cyanide. No attributes such as dosage form, route, or clinical context are present. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the exact code is Calcium cyanide (substance) SCTID 59776000. Parent-level cyanide substances are too general, and no sibling metal cyanide is implied. The name-plus-formula is a clinically equivalent synonym representation."
698797007,Differential interference contrast (qualifier value),Use of differential interference contrast optics,"This statement indicates the use of DIC optics, serving as a technique qualifier in the Qualifier value category. It conveys the specific contrast method without asserting a procedure or providing results. Broader parent categories or alternate optical methods would not be as precise. The wording remains focused on the same concept, with ‘optics’ providing context but not altering code selection."
248200007,Dysmorphic facies (finding),Dysmorphic facial appearance observed,"This documentation phrase reports observation of dysmorphic facial appearance, i.e., dysmorphic facies, as a Clinical finding. It remains within the scope of SCTID 248200007 because it does not specify any etiology or particular facial anomalies. Parent concepts (e.g., abnormal facial appearance) are less specific, and sibling or child concepts indicating specific facies types are not supported by the wording. 'Dysmorphic facial appearance' is a clinically equivalent expression that preserves the same concept."
284442001,Gas station (environment),Petrol station,"This entry uses a regionally variant synonym (‘petrol station’) for the same environmental location as a gas station. The main concept is the fuel retail environment where petrol is dispensed. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and Gas station (environment), SCTID 284442001, is the most precise fit. Parent concepts (e.g., general environment) are too broad, and sibling concepts like service garage or rest area are different. ‘Petrol station’ is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not introduce any new attributes, maintaining the same code."
433115004,Specimen from lip obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen),Lip FNA biopsy specimen,"The entry explicitly denotes a specimen from the anatomical site “lip” and specifies the acquisition method “FNA biopsy,” which corresponds exactly to the SNOMED CT concept “Specimen from lip obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (specimen).” Category: Specimen. This is the most precise match because it includes both the site (lip) and the method (fine needle aspiration). A parent concept such as “Specimen from lip” would omit the aspiration method, and sibling concepts like “Specimen from lip obtained by biopsy” without the fine needle qualifier would be less specific. The abbreviation “FNA” is a clinically standard synonym for “fine needle aspiration” and does not alter the code selection."
413817003,Child day care center (environment),Child day care centre (environment),"This UK spelling variant explicitly states the environment as a child day care centre, mapping to SNOMED CT 413817003 within the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. The entry does not add timing, cause, or roles; it only names the place type. It is more specific than generic day care centers and distinct from adult day care or school environments, justifying this precise code."
1003680007,Human immunodeficiency virus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undifferentiated type (finding),HIV CDC class undifferentiated,"This entry assigns the CDC class for HIV as undifferentiated, constituting a Clinical finding regarding classification. It aligns precisely with SNOMED CT 1003680007 (“HIV CDC undifferentiated type”). Parent or sibling CDC types (A/B/C) are not supported by the statement, and no timing, severity, or stage attributes are introduced."
728068009,Entire accessory ligament of ankle joint (body structure),Body structure: accessory ligament of ankle joint—entire,"The entry labels the item explicitly as a body structure and specifies the entire accessory ligament of the ankle joint, which corresponds to SNOMED CT 728068009. The context “Body structure” does not alter coding; it reinforces the anatomical category. Parent concepts that omit the accessory detail or non-entire versions are not as precise, and sibling concepts introducing laterality or condition would not fit the wording."
16213251000119100,Introducer catheter tip submitted as specimen (specimen),Microbiology specimen—introducer catheter tip,"This entry designates the specimen as appropriate for microbiology and specifically identifies the introducer catheter tip as the material. The main concept remains the specimen type: introducer catheter tip. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. Mentioning 'Microbiology' only indicates the receiving department context and does not add attributes that would shift coding to a procedure or test; therefore SCTID 16213251000119100 remains the most precise match, excluding parent/sibling specimen types."
102405005,Rapid barometric pressure change (physical force),Abrupt change in barometric pressure,"Abrupt indicates a rapid change and barometric pressure names the specific environmental pressure, exactly matching the intended physical force. Category: Physical force. This entry fits SNOMED CT 102405005 because it expresses the speed and type of pressure without specifying increase vs decrease or any injuries. Parent concepts lacking the rapidity attribute would be overly general, while siblings such as blast or shockwave represent different forces. Children indicating decompression or compression are too specific since no direction is stated here."
309112008,Excised bursa specimen (specimen),Surgeon note: bursa removed; specimen provided,"This surgeon documentation notes that the bursa was removed and provided as a specimen, indicating excision. In SNOMED CT, the appropriate Specimen concept is Excised bursa specimen (specimen), SCTID 309112008. The excision method excludes siblings like biopsy or fluid specimens. Parent concepts such as generic “bursa specimen” or “excision specimen” lack necessary specificity. The phrasing is equivalent and introduces no additional attributes beyond the specimen identity."
736990006,Plastic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Plastics inpatient plan of care,"This entry references an inpatient plan of care in the plastics (plastic surgery) specialty, which is a care plan record artifact. It belongs to the Record artifact category. “Plastics” is common shorthand for the plastic surgery specialty and remains semantically equivalent without changing scope. The explicit inpatient context avoids mapping to outpatient care plans and is more specific than overarching inpatient care plans that lack the specialty. No additional clinical attributes are present, making this the correct code selection for Plastic surgery inpatient care plan."
309913004,Clinical allergy department (environment),The clinical allergy department,"The definite article does not change the meaning; the entry still denotes the clinical allergy department care setting, an Environment concept. It maps exactly to SCTID 309913004. Selecting a parent department concept would be less specific, and a sibling clinic concept is not appropriate because the wording is explicitly departmental."
217839002,Accidentally struck by falling object (event),Mechanism noted: accidental strike by falling object,"This entry documents the mechanism as an accidental strike from a falling object, directly matching the concept. Main concepts: mechanism, accidental strike, falling object. SNOMED CT category: Event. It is more specific than generic mechanism entries and does not align with siblings representing thrown or propelled object incidents."
33921000087105,Tissue specimen from sclera (specimen),Histology specimen: tissue from sclera,"This indicates a histology specimen whose tissue originates from the sclera. The main concept combines specimen material (tissue) with source site (sclera), putting it in the Specimen category. It maps precisely to 'Tissue specimen from sclera' and avoids method details, laterality, severity, or associated diagnoses. More general parent concepts lack the scleral site, and sibling concepts from other ocular structures (e.g., conjunctiva) would not match. The phrasing is a paraphrase that is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
366495007,Finding of range of shoulder horizontal flexion (finding),Diagnostic report: shoulder horizontal flexion range finding included,"This indicates that a diagnostic report includes a finding regarding the range for shoulder horizontal flexion, without introducing measurements, severity, or laterality. The correct code is SNOMED CT 366495007 (Finding of range of shoulder horizontal flexion), within the Clinical finding hierarchy. Parent concepts are too general, and siblings covering other shoulder movements or degree-specific measurements do not fit the neutral finding phrasing."
312252006,Positron beam radiation (physical force),Label: positron beam radiation,"This is a label naming positron beam radiation, which is the physical agent in question. Category: Physical force. SCTID 312252006 matches exactly. Selecting a parent (particle or beta radiation) would be too general, and siblings (electron/proton beam radiation) would be incorrect. The labeling context does not add therapeutic, dose, or exposure attributes, so the physical force concept is the most precise and appropriate mapping."
250944009,Right ventricular filling (observable entity),Right ventricular filling documented,"The entry notes documentation of the observable 'right ventricular filling' and does not add results or abnormality qualifiers. Main concept: right ventricular filling. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 250944009 is the most precise match. The use of 'documented' is contextual, not changing the concept to a procedure or finding. Parent/sibling concepts would either be more general or refer to another chamber; specific child metrics are not mentioned."
216018003,"Collision of aircraft with another aircraft, while in transit, other person injured (event)",Transit-phase aircraft-on-aircraft collision with other person injured,"This entry describes a transit-phase collision between aircraft and explicitly notes that an other person was injured. Concepts: aircraft-on-aircraft collision, transit phase, injury to an other person. Category: Event. SCTID 216018003 is the correct, specific match, requiring both the collision type and the in-transit timing along with the injured party designation. Parent codes lacking these specifics or sibling codes like ‘occupant injured’ would be less appropriate. ‘Transit-phase’ is a synonym of ‘while in transit’ and maintains the same meaning."
418553009,Intermediate visual acuity (observable entity),Intermediate visual acuity discussed with patient,"This indicates patient communication about 'Intermediate visual acuity,' yet the concept itself is the observable entity 418553009. No attributes such as abnormality, measurement values, or test actions are added. It is more specific than the parent 'Visual acuity' due to the intermediate qualifier, and it does not suggest near or distance acuity or a procedure."
359067003,Other low protein food (product),"Low-protein foods, other","This entry rearranges the terms but conveys the same residual category: the ‘other’ grouping of low-protein foods. The SNOMED category is Product. The “other” modifier is essential and aligns with SCTID 359067003, not with the broader parent or any specific child concept. It does not introduce attributes like preparation method, packaging, or clinical use. The phrasing is a clinically safe synonym without altering the intended code. It remains distinct from dietary regimen or clinical findings."
315023008,Aspirin prophylaxis declined (situation),Documented refusal of aspirin prophylaxis,"This entry records that the patient refused aspirin intended as prophylaxis. It identifies the medication, preventive intent, and refusal without extra qualifiers. Category: Situation with explicit context. The code 315023008 precisely captures this; general refusal documentation without specifying aspirin or prophylaxis lacks specificity, and therapeutic aspirin refusal siblings do not match the preventive intent."
13495000,Buxus (organism),Boxwood (Buxus),"The entry provides the common name 'boxwood' and the scientific name 'Buxus,' referring to the same genus-level organism. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. This is best coded to Buxus (organism), SCTID 13495000, rather than a parent plant category or a child species concept, because no species is specified. The synonym 'boxwood' is clinically equivalent to Buxus as a genus and does not add attributes."
118344004,Long pulsewidth laser beam (physical force),Long-duration pulse laser beam,"‘Long-duration pulse’ is an accepted synonym of long pulsewidth in laser contexts, conveying the same Physical force. This maps to 118344004 because it specifies the duration characteristic of the beam. It is more precise than the generic 'laser beam' and excludes sibling concepts with different pulse durations. The paraphrase does not alter the intended code."
56219004,Motion (physical force),History entry: motion (physical force),"The entry situates the concept within a history note but retains “Motion (physical force)” as the coded concept, SCTID 56219004. Category: Physical force. No added clinical attributes or mechanisms are implied. It avoids confusion with findings (range of motion, motor activity) or artifacts; thus, the physical force concept is the most precise match."
106411000119105,Sampling of vagina for Papanicolaou smear after benign hysterectomy done (situation),Specimen source: vagina; test: Papanicolaou smear; patient s/p benign hysterectomy; collection performed.,"This documentation-style entry enumerates the specimen source (vagina), the test (Papanicolaou smear), and the context (status post benign hysterectomy), and confirms that collection was performed. The primary concepts are vaginal sampling for Pap smear and post–benign hysterectomy context, making it a Situation rather than a generic procedure-only concept. Broader or sibling concepts would omit site-specificity or the benign hysterectomy context or misidentify the site (cervix). The phraseology is synonymous with the concept description and adds no extra attributes beyond those required."
1335806003,Amputation of left third toe (procedure),Third toe amputation on the left,"This states a toe amputation with clear specification: third toe and left laterality. The concept is a Procedure that aligns exactly with Amputation of left third toe (procedure). Using the parent concept that does not specify laterality or toe number would be too broad, and sibling concepts targeting a different toe or the right side would be inaccurate. No additional attributes such as level of amputation or timing are present, justifying SCTID 1335806003."
1365811007,Photographic intraoral image with view of frenum (record artifact),Dental clinical photograph (intraoral) showing frenum,"The entry states a dental clinical photographic image taken intraorally that shows the frenum, falling under Record artifact. It matches SNOMED CT 1365811007 because it retains the key attributes: photographic modality, intraoral site, and frenum view. The dental context does not alter the artifact’s nature. Parent or sibling concepts lacking frenum or describing other oral structures would be less appropriate."
365484008,Finding of attitude (finding),Patient's attitude — finding,"The entry identifies a finding concerning the patient’s attitude, without qualifying what that attitude is. This is a Clinical finding and precisely matches SNOMED CT 365484008 Finding of attitude (finding). While it mentions “patient’s,” this is implicit in clinical recording and does not add attributes such as target specificity beyond the generic attitude domain. Broader parents and narrower children (e.g., cooperative or hostile attitude) are not supported by the wording; the phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym."
1137516004,Weakness of thenar muscle (finding),Thenar muscle weakness documented,"This documentation statement clearly captures weakness localized to the thenar muscles, without extra attributes such as laterality, severity, or etiology. It is a Clinical finding and matches SCTID 1137516004. Coding to broader or different concepts (e.g., hand weakness, thenar atrophy, or thumb functional weakness) would not reflect the exact wording. The phrase reiterates the target concept directly and uniquely."
397301009,Contact lens center thickness (observable entity),Center thickness (contact lens),"This entry specifies the parameter and limits scope to contact lenses by the parenthetical. The concept is an Observable entity describing the center thickness of a contact lens. It does not suggest a measurement procedure or any abnormality; it is the parameter itself. It excludes other contact lens parameters (e.g., base curve, diameter) or non-contact lenses, ensuring SCTID 397301009 is the exact match rather than a parent or sibling concept."
309104000,Musculoskeletal specimen (specimen),Specimen category: musculoskeletal,"This labels the specimen’s category as musculoskeletal, clearly identifying the source system. It remains a Specimen concept without added attributes. More generic parents are too broad, and specific children (e.g., bone or tendon specimen) would not match the wording. SCTID 309104000 is the precise code."
1365806005,Photographic intraoral direct image of inferior frontal view with teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),"Imaging: photographic intraoral direct image, inferior frontal view, centric occlusion.","This record line describes an imaging artifact that is photographic, intraoral, direct, in an inferior frontal view, and taken with teeth in centric occlusion. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Each attribute maps to SCTID 1365806005. Parent artifacts that omit view or occlusion details are not as precise, and siblings like different views or non-direct methods would be inappropriate. Terminology is semantically aligned with the preferred term."
707732003,Device material (physical object),Device material — history item,"The entry functions as a history note label but points to the concept of device material itself. It is a Physical object concept and not a clinical finding or event. No narrowing to particular materials or components occurs. Given this, 'Device material' [707732003] is the most precise code and is preferred over broader or narrower alternatives."
44146006,Structure of laryngeal lymph follicles (body structure),Laryngeal lymph follicle anatomy,"This describes the anatomical aspect of the laryngeal lymph follicles, focusing on the structure itself. Category: Body structure. SCTID 44146006 is the most precise, capturing the laryngeal lymph follicles. Parents such as laryngeal anatomy or lymphoid tissue are too general, and siblings like laryngeal nodes or adjacent laryngeal parts do not match the follicular nature. No additional attributes (severity, timing, abnormality) are introduced; this is purely structural."
118952005,Joint finding (finding),Articular finding,"The term 'articular' is a clinically standard synonym for 'joint,' so 'articular finding' denotes a joint-related clinical finding without specifying what the finding is. The main concept is a joint clinical observation, with no additional attributes. This belongs to Clinical finding and maps to Joint finding (finding) 118952005. Using a parent concept would be less accurate because the focus is specifically on a joint, while child or sibling concepts (e.g., arthropathy, joint pain) would add specificity not present in the wording. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
52800001,Marine toxin (substance),Marine biological toxin,"A biological toxin with marine origin corresponds to Marine toxin (substance), SCTID 52800001, in the Substance hierarchy. The entry does not introduce attributes like severity or timing, nor specify a particular toxin, so child concepts are not appropriate. The parent concept Toxin (substance) lacks the marine provenance, reducing precision. 'Biological toxin' reflects the same scope as 'biotoxin' and is an acceptable synonym, leaving the code selection unchanged."
44558001,Repair of inguinal hernia (procedure),Postoperative note: inguinal hernia repair,"While indicating a postoperative documentation context, the content remains the procedure “inguinal hernia repair,” which maps to SNOMED CT 44558001 in the Procedure hierarchy. No qualifiers such as laterality, technique, recurrence status, or complications are introduced. Parent concepts would be too general, and child concepts like laparoscopic repair would add unmentioned attributes. Thus, this is an appropriate, precise coding to 44558001."
737397009,Assessment of risk from bed rail use done (situation),Patient reports the bed rail use risk assessment was done.,"A patient-reported statement that the bed rail use risk assessment was done indicates completion of the specific assessment without outcomes or timing. The concept is assessment of risk from bed rail use with a done status, aligning with the Situation category. SCTID 737397009 is the most precise code as it denotes the completed assessment related to bed rail use. A generic parent misses the specific subject, and procedural siblings omit the explicit 'done' context. The patient-report perspective does not change attributes; it simply affirms completion."
185484000,Dermatology outreach clinic (environment),Clinical environment: dermatology outreach clinic,"This entry defines the clinical environment as a dermatology outreach clinic, corresponding to “Dermatology outreach clinic (environment)” SCTID 185484000. The main concept is the care setting; no added attributes are present. SNOMED CT category: Environment. Parent concepts like generic dermatology clinic or generic outreach clinic lack one of the specified facets, and sibling environments for other specialties are not applicable. The contextual label “Clinical environment” does not change the code selection."
704401009,Knowledge level of physical therapy (observable entity),Familiarity level with physical therapy,"“Familiarity level” is often used interchangeably with knowledge level in patient education contexts and ties specifically to physical therapy in this entry. No values or extra attributes are present, keeping it within Observable entity semantics. SCTID 704401009 is appropriate because it is about the level of knowledge concerning physical therapy; parents like general familiarity or knowledge level of healthcare topics are too broad, and siblings for other therapies would be incorrect. The synonym preserves equivalence."
840353005,Transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (substance),Material recorded: TRAM myocutaneous flap,"This states the recorded material as a TRAM myocutaneous flap, naming the transverse rectus abdominis source. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The wording matches SCTID 840353005 exactly by specifying the flap type and composition. Broader parent concepts would not capture the transverse rectus abdominis specificity, and sibling concepts (VRAM, DIEP) are different flap designs. The term “material” situates it as a substance and avoids introducing extra attributes, preserving the precise mapping to the TRAM flap substance."
408791003,Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination declined (situation),BCG shot declined,"The entry indicates the BCG shot (a common synonym for vaccination) was declined. This is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 408791003 is the right code because it identifies the BCG vaccine and the declined decision. Parent concepts like “shot declined” would be too vague, and siblings such as “BCG shot administered” would be incorrect. The term “shot” is a colloquial synonym for vaccination and does not introduce new attributes."
284555002,Zoo - place (environment),Zoological garden,"This entry expresses the same environmental location as a zoo using the widely accepted synonym 'zoological garden,' fitting SNOMED CT 'Zoo - place (environment)' (SCTID 284555002). Category: Environment or geographical location. No additional attributes are introduced; the phrase solely denotes the place. Using 'garden' in this context is historical and geographic phrasing for a zoo, not a different concept. Parent categories are too broad, and siblings such as 'Botanical garden' or 'Aquarium' are inappropriate because the wording clearly refers to a zoo."
394694005,Discussed with district nurse (situation),Provider note: discussed with district nurse,"Within a provider note, this entry records that a discussion occurred with the district nurse, without additional attributes such as topic, medium, or timing. SNOMED CT category: Situation. It precisely matches 'Discussed with district nurse (situation)'. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., discussed with another professional or via a specific method) are less appropriate given the lack of such qualifiers."
270101008,Medical certificate of still-birth (record artifact),Medical certificate of still-birth on file,"This indicates the medical certificate related to a still-birth is present in the record, clearly a record artifact. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact; the best match is Medical certificate of still-birth (270101008). The phrase “on file” is a storage status and does not add clinical attributes. Broader or different certificates (e.g., general medical certificate, death certificate) would be less specific or incorrect. The entry retains semantic equivalence to the preferred term and therefore maps unambiguously."
2451000181107,Mixed venous plasma specimen (specimen),Mixed venous plasma specimen documented,"This entry records documentation of a specimen identified as mixed venous plasma, mapping to the SNOMED CT Specimen concept “Mixed venous plasma specimen” (SCTID 2451000181107). No additional attributes are implied. Parents that do not specify mixed venous origin are too broad, and siblings that refer to different matrices or sources would be inaccurate, justifying use of the precise mixed venous plasma specimen code."
261233001,Meshed split thickness autograft of skin (substance),Meshed split-thickness autograft of skin,"The entry denotes the substance: a meshed, split-thickness autograft composed of skin. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It aligns with SCTID 261233001 by naming meshing, split thickness, and autologous source, and by referring to the graft material rather than a procedure. Parent concepts that are broader (e.g., skin autograft, split-thickness autograft without meshing) are less precise, and sibling concepts (e.g., meshed full-thickness autograft or meshed split-thickness allograft) are excluded by the attributes “split-thickness” and “autograft.” No added attributes like donor site, mesh ratio, or timing are introduced."
309103006,Excised cartilage specimen (specimen),"Cartilage sample, excised","The entry indicates a sample (synonym for specimen) of cartilage, obtained by excision. This is a Specimen-type concept, mapping to SCTID 309103006. Omitting 'excised' would default to a parent concept, and introducing other acquisition methods (e.g., biopsy) would miscode. 'Sample' is a clinically safe synonym for 'specimen' and does not change the code selection."
58147004,Clinical (qualifier value),Follow-up documentation: clinical,"The phrase places ‘clinical’ as the documented value in a follow-up context, functioning strictly as a qualifier. It introduces no other attributes. Clinical (qualifier value) is the correct SNOMED CT selection; a parent Qualifier value would be too general, and sibling concepts or domain-specific clinical terms would add content not stated."
278210005,Serotype B3 (qualifier value),Follow-up note: serotype B3,"This follow-up documentation states the serotype value B3, and does not include method, organism, sample, or timing details beyond the context label. The concept is a Qualifier value and the precise SNOMED CT match is Serotype B3 (qualifier value), SCTID 278210005. Broader parents or other serotype siblings are not appropriate given the explicit 'B3' value. The follow-up context does not alter the qualifier semantics."
106821000119101,History of oligodendroglioma of brain (situation),Oncology history includes brain oligodendroglioma,"Stating that the oncology history includes a brain oligodendroglioma indicates a past event, not an active diagnosis in this statement. It fits the Situation with explicit context category and aligns with “History of oligodendroglioma of brain” (106821000119101). A location-unspecified history concept (e.g., history of oligodendroglioma) would be less precise, and sibling concepts for other glial tumors are incorrect. The wording maintains the same clinical meaning as the preferred term without adding new attributes."
224816003,Farming environment (environment),Surroundings described as a farming environment,"The phrasing identifies the surroundings (environment) as farming, without adding any cause, severity, or event attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It matches Farming environment (environment) SCTID 224816003. General Environment would be non-specific, and selecting a geographical 'farm' or place-of-occurrence code would be inappropriate because the entry emphasizes environmental type rather than a specific location or event site."
63084001,Clindamycin hydrochloride (substance),Clindamycin hydrochloride noted in documentation,"The documentation notes the presence of clindamycin hydrochloride, naming the substance explicitly. Without any strength, form, or administration details, the correct mapping is to the Substance concept 63084001. The hydrochloride designation prevents mapping to broader clindamycin or sibling salt concepts."
725957005,Formalin-fixed placenta tissue specimen (specimen),Specimen: formalin-fixed placenta tissue,"This is a concise laboratory-style description of a specimen consisting of placenta-derived tissue that has been formalin-fixed. The concept is purely a specimen type, with no procedural or diagnostic assertions. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. It maps directly to SNOMED CT 725957005 because it includes both the source (placenta tissue) and processing (formalin fixation). Using only “placenta specimen” could imply whole-organ, and “formalin-fixed specimen” alone would be too generic, so those parent concepts are less precise. The wording is a synonymous paraphrase and does not change the concept."
260318004,1 o'clock position (qualifier value),Follow-up reference: 1 o'clock position.,"This follow-up note references the same clockface orientation at 1 o'clock, and no other attributes are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 260318004 is the correct, specific code. Parent or generic position qualifiers would be less precise, and other hour positions are sibling codes that do not fit. The context of a follow-up does not alter the positional meaning."
1157271008,Numeric grade on a scale of 1 to 7 (qualifier value),Assessment documented: numeric grade scale 1–7,"This entry communicates that the assessment was documented using a numeric grade scale constrained to 1–7, matching Numeric grade on a scale of 1 to 7. The category is Qualifier value. It does not name a clinical measure or a specific grade value, thus correctly referencing the qualifier for the grading scale. Parent concepts that don’t specify the range and siblings with other ranges or properties would be less appropriate. The synonymous wording preserves the same meaning without adding attributes."
1343546001,Structure of left proximal common extensor tendon insertion within elbow region (body structure),Anatomical site—left proximal common extensor tendon insertion,"The entry identifies an anatomical site and specifies it as the proximal insertion of the common extensor tendon on the left side. Attributes: common extensor tendon, insertion site, proximal positioning, left laterality; the elbow region is implied from the named concept and consistent with the common extensor insertion. Category is Body structure (Anatomical structure). SCTID 1343546001 is correct because it represents this exact left proximal insertion within the elbow region; mapping to a parent without laterality or to siblings such as the right side, flexor tendon insertion, or lateral epicondyle bone structure would be less precise. The wording does not add clinical findings or timing."
698027009,Citicoline (substance),Follow-up entry: citicoline (substance),"This follow-up documentation explicitly calls out citicoline as a substance, without formulation, dosage, route, or brand details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It maps best to Citicoline (substance) SCTID 698027009. Parent concepts would be less specific, and medicinal product or salt variants are not supported by this wording."
702862008,Gynecology clinic (environment),Gynaecology clinic,"This entry uses the UK spelling of the same setting, indicating a clinic for gynecology. The concept category is Environment, and the best match is Gynecology clinic (environment) SCTID 702862008. The spelling variation is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not change the semantics, nor does it add attributes like obstetrics or outpatient/inpatient qualifiers. Parent concepts (e.g., Clinic) are too broad, and siblings that include obstetrics or women’s health are not appropriate given the exclusive gynecology focus."
399402006,Specimen from ureter (specimen),"Ureter specimen, submitted","This phrasing indicates that a specimen, identified by origin site as the ureter, has been submitted, without specifying specimen type or laterality. The core concept is a specimen from the ureter. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 399402006 precisely represents a specimen taken from the ureter. A parent like “Specimen” would lose the site detail, whereas child concepts like “Ureter tissue specimen” or “Ureter urine specimen” add attributes not in the text. Siblings naming other sites are incompatible. The word “submitted” adds workflow context but does not change the specimen’s identity."
363109007,Evaluation of test results (procedure),Checking of test results,"The entry conveys that test results were checked, which in clinical workflow corresponds to evaluating or reviewing results. It does not introduce any attributes like modality, extent, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure and the best match is 363109007. More specific children would require mention of a particular kind of test, which is absent. Siblings focusing on administrative tasks or patient disclosure are not supported by the wording. 'Checking' is used here as a clinically safe synonym for evaluation."
700143000,No history of depression (situation),Social work assessment: patient has no history of depression,"This assessment documents that the patient lacks any prior history of depression. The main concept is the negated past medical history for depression, which is a Situation with explicit context. The precise SNOMED code is “No history of depression” (SCTID 700143000). Broader concepts (e.g., no psychiatric history) and narrower subtypes (e.g., major depressive disorder) are less appropriate. The phrasing is a clear, clinically equivalent expression without added attributes."
1149429006,World Health Organization classification of tumors histologic grading system (staging scale),WHO tumor grading (histologic) scale documented,"This entry indicates documentation of the WHO histologic tumor grading scale, focusing on the scale rather than any assigned grade. SNOMED CT category: Staging scale (assessment scale). It matches SCTID 1149429006 because it names the WHO histologic grading scale specifically. Parent or sibling concepts (general grading, TNM staging, or site-specific grading systems) are less appropriate given the explicit WHO reference."
1254678001,Bite by Solenopsis (event),Event: bite by Solenopsis,"This statement explicitly frames the occurrence as an event and identifies a bite by Solenopsis, without additional context or attributes. In SNOMED CT, it maps to the Event concept SCTID 1254678001. Parents covering generic insect/ant bites are less specific, and siblings indicating a sting are not applicable. The addition of the word “Event” does not change clinical meaning; it clarifies hierarchy while remaining equivalent."
106051002,Finding related to respiratory sounds (finding),Unspecified finding of respiratory sounds,"The entry explicitly denotes a clinical finding of respiratory sounds without specifying the nature of the sound, normality, or location. The category is Clinical finding; the best code is 106051002 (Finding related to respiratory sounds). Using more general parent concepts would not emphasize the sound-related nature, and particular children like wheeze or normal breath sounds are not supported. 'Unspecified' accurately reflects the lack of detail and keeps the mapping at the appropriate level."
1264485007,Presence of malignant melanoma at surgical margin in excised specimen of skin (observable entity),Observable result—skin excision margin: malignant melanoma present.,"The entry frames the margin status in an excised skin specimen as an observable result, with melanoma present. It is an Observable entity by definition. SCTID 1264485007 precisely matches this observation: presence of malignant melanoma at the surgical margin in a skin excision. Less specific concepts (e.g., any tumor margin positivity or melanoma disorder codes) would miss either the tumor specificity or the specimen/margin context. The phrasing is a direct synonym for the preferred concept."
415667005,Administration of sulfonylurea not indicated (situation),Discharge plan: sulfonylurea administration not indicated.,"Even within a discharge plan, the statement captures the situation that administering sulfonylurea is not indicated. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 415667005 is the most accurate code as it conveys non-indication for administration of the sulfonylurea class. It does not present reasons, timing qualifiers, or specify particular agents. It is more specific than generic parents and is not synonymous with contraindication siblings."
301604002,Difficulty managing stairs on bottom (finding),Stair use impaired at bottom (difficulty managing),"The entry describes impaired stair use at the bottom, explicitly framed as difficulty managing. This is a Clinical finding mapping to SNOMED CT 301604002. Using a general stair difficulty code would drop the bottom specificity, and sibling concepts involving the top or ascent/descent are not applicable. 'Impaired' here is synonymous with functional difficulty; the parenthetical preserves the 'difficulty managing' phrasing and does not add severity or causation, ensuring accurate coding."
180760006,Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (substance),Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap type,"The word 'type' contextualizes classification but the material named is the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, a specific substance. No attributes such as recipient site, timing, or laterality are introduced, so the SNOMED CT category remains Substance. SCTID 180760006 precisely matches this flap type. A parent like 'Myocutaneous flap type' would be overly generic, and siblings for different donor muscles would be incorrect. The phrasing is a taxonomy-related synonym that does not change code selection."
1363298005,Presence of atelectasis and/or obstructive pneumonitis extending to hilar structure of resected lung specimen (observable entity),Checklist item: presence of atelectasis and/or obstructive pneumonitis extending to the lung hilum (resection specimen),"The entry denotes a checklist item assessing presence of atelectasis and/or obstructive pneumonitis with extension to the lung hilum in a resection specimen. This is clearly an Observable entity, not a patient disorder. SCTID 1363298005 precisely represents this measurement target; parent concepts about presence of conditions without the hilar extension or specimen context would be insufficiently specific, and sibling items concerning other anatomic extents would be mismatched. The terms “lung hilum” and “resection specimen” are clinically equivalent to “hilar structure of resected lung specimen,” maintaining identical attributes."
364290001,Characteristic of sensation of cervix (observable entity),Sensory characteristic—uterine cervix,"This entry captures the sensory characteristic at the anatomical site of the uterine cervix, clearly identifying an observable attribute rather than a symptom. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. Code 364290001 is the best fit because it refers specifically to the characteristic of cervix sensation. Broader observables or sibling concepts that imply specific sensations or clinical findings (e.g., pain, tenderness) would not be appropriate, as the entry does not provide a value or diagnosis. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of 'characteristic of sensation of cervix' and preserves the intended meaning."
1231767006,Education about nocturnal home hemodialysis (procedure),Instruction regarding nocturnal home hemodialysis,"The entry describes patient instruction (education) specifically about nocturnal home hemodialysis, which includes the essential qualifiers nocturnal, home, and hemodialysis. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, as it documents an educational intervention. It is the most accurate match for 'Education about nocturnal home hemodialysis (procedure)', while parent concepts like general dialysis instruction or siblings lacking either the nocturnal or home attribute would be less appropriate. 'Instruction' is a clinically equivalent term for education and does not alter the concept."
411642002,Brassica oleracea variant gemmifera diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract of Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera,"The entry states a diagnostic allergen extract and specifies the source as Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera, which is Brussels sprout, clearly identifying the product. SNOMED CT category: Product (pharmaceutical/biologic product). This is the precise match for 411642002 because it defines both the use (diagnostic allergen extract) and the exact botanical variant. More general parents (diagnostic allergen extract without source) or other Brassica variant siblings would not be as specific. No new attributes beyond the concept are introduced."
726638008,Transenteric drainage tube (physical object),Transenteric drainage tube,"The phrase identifies a drainage tube that traverses the enteric (intestinal) tract, which matches the physical object concept Transenteric drainage tube (SCTID 726638008). Category: Physical object (device). It specifies a drainage tube and the transenteric route without adding placement status, target anatomy beyond the enteric system, or clinical attributes. This is more precise than a parent like generic “drainage tube,” and it avoids sibling devices such as enteral feeding tubes or transgastric drains. The wording is a direct match to the preferred term and thus selects the exact code."
257562009,Airport (environment),Patient reports being at the airport,"This patient statement identifies the place as an airport without introducing other clinical attributes. It maps to SNOMED CT 257562009 Airport (environment). The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. While it provides a narrative context, the only codable concept is the environment ‘airport’; it is not a more general parent nor a more specific sibling like terminal or runway, so the airport environment code is most appropriate."
455371000124106,Invalid result (qualifier value),Invalid result,"The main concept explicitly states that a result is invalid. This is a status applied to a test or observation value and belongs to the SNOMED CT category Qualifier value. The phrase directly matches “Invalid result (qualifier value)” [455371000124106] and does not introduce any cause, timing, severity, or related attributes. Broader or sibling statuses such as indeterminate, inconclusive, canceled, or not available would be inaccurate given the wording; this entry specifically conveys invalidity, which is the most precise match."
218221003,Overexertion from pulling (event),Overexertion while pulling,"The phrase indicates an episode of overexertion occurring during pulling activity, which exactly matches the Event concept Overexertion from pulling (event), SCTID 218221003. It does not add injury details or site, nor does it shift the mechanism to lifting, pushing, or other actions. As such, this is more specific than the parent Overexertion (event) and does not align with sibling mechanisms, supporting the choice of 218221003."
122880004,Urine specimen obtained by clean catch procedure (specimen),"Urine specimen, clean catch technique used","This entry specifies urine as the specimen and clean catch as the technique, directly aligning with SNOMED CT 'Urine specimen obtained by clean catch procedure' (SCTID 122880004) in the Specimen category. No additional qualifiers (e.g., timing, midstream-only, test type) are introduced. Parent concepts would be less specific, and siblings reflecting other collection methods do not fit the stated technique. The phrase indicates the specimen rather than documenting a separate procedure."
284534004,Hallway (environment),Documented environment is hallway,This documentation identifies the environment as a hallway without adding specific qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 284534004 precisely captures 'hallway.' Parent concepts are too broad; environment siblings such as lobby or stairwell would be incorrect. The phrase is a documentation cue and does not introduce attributes beyond the hallway concept.
840519007,Product containing aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor (product),Drug product containing aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor,"The phrase 'drug product' clearly references a medicinal product, and 'containing aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor' defines its pharmacologic content. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 840519007 is the best match because it is a product classification based on the presence of an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor without further specification. The entry does not introduce dose form, route, specific ingredient, or indication, which would push to a child concept. It also avoids mapping to the substance class itself, ensuring the correct product-level concept is selected."
257962003,Upper case Roman letter C (qualifier value),"Entry: C (upper case, Roman)","Despite the contextual prefix 'Entry:', the substance is the Roman letter C in upper case, which maps directly to SNOMED CT qualifier value 257962003. Category: Qualifier value. The context does not introduce new clinical attributes; it still denotes only the letter form. Parent concepts without case are less precise; siblings like lower case Roman C or other letters are inconsistent with the explicit uppercase C."
12043009,Spontaneous combustion (physical force),Spontaneous combustion identified,"The event is spontaneous combustion; ‘identified’ indicates recognition without adding attributes. Category: Physical force. The concept remains the physical force of unassisted ignition and does not include injury or temporal qualifiers. Parent concepts are too broad (combustion/ignition without spontaneous), and siblings describe different phenomena. Best match: SNOMED CT 12043009."
465132008,Assistive sewing machine (physical object),Assistive sewing machine device,"The entry identifies the physical object as a device and specifies it is an assistive sewing machine, which matches the concept precisely. This belongs to the Physical object category. The best SNOMED CT match is Assistive sewing machine (465132008). A parent like Sewing machine (physical object) lacks the assistive aspect, and a broad Assistive device (physical object) does not indicate the sewing machine type. The term 'device' does not add attributes beyond the intended concept."
364408002,Fontanelle feature (observable entity),Fontanelle feature,"The main concept here is the observable characteristic of the fontanelle, stated simply as “Fontanelle feature.” This is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT, matching SCTID 364408002. No abnormality, size, timing, location (anterior/posterior), or status is specified, so it does not map to child findings like bulging or sunken fontanelle, nor to measurement observables such as anterior fontanelle size. It is more specific than a generic observable entity parent and distinct from sibling observables of other structures. The wording exactly aligns with the concept’s name and role as a data element for fontanelle-related observations."
761943001,Therapy prescription record (record artifact),Therapy Rx record,"This phrase uses the clinically conventional abbreviation 'Rx' to mean 'prescription,' coupled with 'record,' clearly indicating a documented artifact of a therapy prescription. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It aligns with 761943001 as it focuses on the record of a therapy prescription. A parent concept like 'Prescription record' would be overly broad because it could include medications; a sibling like 'Medication prescription record' would be wrong since therapy (non-pharmacologic) is specified. The Rx synonym is standard and does not alter code selection."
736887004,"Surgical traction tensiometer, electronic (physical object)",Surgical traction electronic tension meter,"This wording maintains the same components—surgical traction context, electronic modality, and a tension-measuring instrument ('tension meter' as a synonym for tensiometer). The concept falls under Physical object (device). SCTID 736887004 is correct because it encapsulates an electronic tensiometer for surgical traction. A parent or generic device omitting electronic modality would be less specific, and siblings like mechanical tensiometers or non-surgical tension meters would misrepresent the intended use. The synonym choice does not introduce new attributes or change the conceptual scope."
411624007,Anguilla anguilla diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen—European eel (Anguilla anguilla) extract,"The entry describes a diagnostic allergen extract of European eel, explicitly equated with Anguilla anguilla, used for allergy testing. There is no specification of method, route, or therapeutic use. SNOMED CT category: Product. This matches SCTID 411624007. Parent diagnostic allergen product concepts are less specific, while siblings (e.g., other eel species or therapeutic extracts) would be incorrect. The lack of method detail avoids mapping to any child concept specific to a testing technique."
224059007,Indiana (geographic location),Map location: Indiana,"The phrase conveys Indiana as the map-referenced location, maintaining focus on the geographic entity. SNOMED CT category: Location; Indiana (geographic location) [224059007] is the appropriate code. The ‘map’ label is contextual and does not suggest a different finding. Parent concepts (United States) are broader, and child concepts (cities/counties) would be too specific; this wording matches the state-level location."
232890002,Reimplantation of atrioventricular valve papillary muscle (procedure),Surgeon performed reimplantation of atrioventricular valve papillary muscle,"This narrative confirms that reimplantation of the AV valve papillary muscle was performed, a surgical Procedure. It maps precisely to SCTID 232890002. The lack of valve subtype or adjunct techniques prevents drift to child codes or broader parent procedures. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not alter the intended code selection."
408129002,Class II bacteriostatic thigh length stocking (physical object),Compression therapy device: class II bacteriostatic thigh-high stocking,"This entry names a compression therapy device defined by Class II compression, bacteriostatic fabric, and thigh-high length. It belongs to the physical object category. SCTID 408129002 matches exactly. Mapping to parent concepts would drop specificity (class or bacteriostatic), and choosing siblings with other classes or lengths would misrepresent the device. The phrase 'compression therapy device' is a general header and the specific device is the stocking named."
419954003,Ileostomy route (qualifier value),Via the ileostomy stoma,"This entry uses natural phrasing to indicate the route of administration through the ileostomy stoma, focusing solely on the pathway. The primary concept is the route qualifier value in the SNOMED CT hierarchy, precisely matched by Ileostomy route (qualifier value), SCTID 419954003. It avoids mapping to procedure codes (ileostomy creation or revision) and excludes other stoma or non-enteral routes. The synonym “via the ileostomy stoma” is clinically equivalent to “ileostomy route” and does not add attributes such as timing or substance that would affect code selection."
285656000,Mechanical tension (physical force),Mechanical tension force,"The wording specifies that the force being described is mechanical tension, i.e., a tensile pulling force, with no added clinical context or attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. Mechanical tension (physical force) [285656000] is the exact match; using a general physical force parent would reduce specificity, and choosing a sibling force (compression, shear) would be inaccurate. This phrasing is a direct synonym and does not alter the code selection."
50627005,Labetalol hydrochloride (substance),Drug substance—labetalol hydrochloride,"This entry names the drug substance, aligning with the Substance category and correctly identifying the hydrochloride salt. SCTID 50627005 captures the precise substance. Mapping to a product containing labetalol hydrochloride would be incorrect because no product details are included. Mapping to the base ‘labetalol (substance)’ would lose the salt specification that is present in the wording."
87588000,High altitude (physical force),High-elevation environment,"This entry denotes an environment characterized by high elevation, which is synonymous with high altitude; it conveys the physical environmental condition without adding exposure events, clinical effects, or temporal details. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force, and High altitude (physical force) [87588000] is the most precise match. Broader parent categories (environmental forces) would be too general, while siblings like hypobaric environment or related disorders/events would misrepresent the intended pure environmental physical force."
698853000,Plastic operation on pharynx (procedure),Plastic surgery of the pharynx,"This phrasing denotes a surgical plastic (reconstructive/plasty) procedure on the pharynx, which corresponds to the same concept. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 698853000 is the most precise match because it is defined as plastic operation on the pharynx and this wording is a clinically equivalent synonym. It avoids specifying technique (e.g., flap) or indication (e.g., VPI), so child/sibling concepts are not better matches. No additional attributes are introduced."
298636000,Normal active range of lumbar spine left lateral flexion (finding),Documented normal active range for lumbar spine left lateral bending,"This documentation records a normal active range for the lumbar spine in left lateral bending, a synonym for lateral flexion. Attributes include lumbar spine, left lateral flexion, active modality, and normal status. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 298636000 precisely fits. Sibling concepts like right lateral bending, passive ROM, abnormal range, or general ROM without laterality would not capture the exact movement and modality specified."
446306009,Urine specimen obtained from urinary collection bag (specimen),Urine sample withdrawn from collection bag,"This indicates a urine sample withdrawn from a collection bag, directly corresponding to a urinary collection bag source and SNOMED CT 446306009. Category: Specimen. It does not imply midstream, clean-catch, or catheter port collection, avoiding sibling codes. The phrasing emphasizes the source without adding extraneous attributes, ensuring the correct, specific mapping."
399345000,Adult echocardiography procedure report (record artifact),Adult echocardiography report artifact,"This is a direct statement that the artifact is an adult echocardiography report, focusing on the record artifact category. The main concept is the document reporting an adult echo procedure. Category: Record artifact. SCTID 399345000 is the most accurate match, more specific than generic report artifact concepts and distinct from pediatric echo reports or subtype-specific echo reports, and not to be confused with the echocardiography procedure itself."
90391002,Blast (physical force),Blast phenomenon (physical force),"This phrasing clarifies the phenomenon being referred to is a physical force and specifically a blast, without introducing injury or event attributes. The main concept is blast as a physical force; the SNOMED CT category is Physical force. It fits 90391002 because the phenomenon specified is the blast force, not a general phenomenon or event. Parent Physical force would be nonspecific, and related siblings (Explosion, Shock wave without blast qualifier, or Blast injury) would not match the exact wording."
1333928004,Computed tomography arthrography of left knee with contrast (procedure),"CT arthrography, left knee, contrast-enhanced","The phrase succinctly captures CT arthrography of the left knee and notes contrast enhancement, synonymous with contrast use in arthrography. Category: Procedure. It precisely matches SCTID 1333928004. Parent or sibling alternatives (e.g., unspecified laterality, right knee, MR arthrogram, or standard CT with contrast but not arthrography) do not reflect the described technique and site. The synonym choice maintains equivalence and codability."
224037005,Region of United States of America (geographic location),Section of the United States of America,"The term ‘section’ is used here as a synonym for a regional area within the United States. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). It is not the country-level concept and does not denote a specific named or administrative unit; thus it should not map to a parent or sibling like ‘state of U.S.’. The phrasing supports the selection of Region of United States of America, SCTID 224037005."
81227000,Human rhinovirus 83 (organism),Human rhinovirus 83,"The entry names the organism exactly as “Human rhinovirus 83,” which is the precise taxonomic label for SNOMED CT concept 81227000. Category is Organism. It refers solely to the virus identity and does not imply presence, infection, or any clinical finding. A broader parent like “Human rhinovirus (organism)” or “Rhinovirus (organism)” would be less specific, and any sibling such as HRV-1 or HRV-14 would be incorrect. No additional attributes are introduced, so the organism concept and code are the most accurate match."
1187058005,Entire bulb of penis (body structure),The documented anatomical landmark is the bulb of the penis.,"This narrative confirms the anatomical landmark as the bulb of the penis, indicating the whole structure without additional clinical attributes. It is a Body structure concept mapping to Entire bulb of penis (SCTID 1187058005). Parent terms are too general, and siblings like the glans or corpus cavernosum describe different parts. The documentation context does not alter the anatomical identity or imply partial anatomy. The phrasing is equivalent to standard synonyms and supports the same code."
285077003,Scout and guide hut (environment),The scout and guide hut was the location,"This sentence frames the environment as the location, but the core concept remains the specific place type: a scout and guide hut. No causal or temporal attributes are included. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Environment or geographical location category and maps directly to 285077003. Choosing a parent like ""location"" in general or a sibling like ""Scout hut"" would be inadequate because the wording identifies the exact environment: a hut for both Scouts and Guides."
350269002,Product containing quaternary ammonium and surfactant (product),Stock entry: quaternary ammonium/surfactant product,"This text indicates a stocked product that includes both a quaternary ammonium compound and a surfactant, without adding information on brand, form, purpose, or particular substances. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It maps best to “Product containing quaternary ammonium and surfactant” because it specifies both ingredient classes. Parent concepts with only quaternary ammonium or only surfactant are too general, and children/siblings with specific chemical identities or intended uses would be too narrow. The slash construction concisely denotes co-components and does not change the coding."
76969000,Staphylococcus caprae (organism),Genus/species: Staphylococcus caprae,"The entry marks the classification context ('Genus/species') and then precisely names Staphylococcus caprae, which is the species concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No infection, site, or timing is implied; therefore, organism code selection is most precise. Parent or sibling concepts are excluded as the exact species is specified, and findings/procedures are not referenced."
250456004,Urate crystal (substance),Analyte target name: urate crystal,"Here, urate crystal is named as the analyte target but still denotes the Substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and SCTID 250456004 Urate crystal (substance) is the precise match. The phrasing does not assert measurement results or presence; therefore, it avoids finding codes and does not specify particular salt variants, avoiding child concepts."
257661008,Police station (environment),Radiology report location: police station,"Here, the report lists the location as a police station, expressing only the environment. Category: Environment or geographical location (Environment). While unusual for imaging, the phrasing still denotes the site without adding attributes like timing or subareas. Broader parent locations or sibling facilities are less specific. Police station (environment), SCTID 257661008, is the exact match."
395084008,Discussed with caregiver (situation),Talked with caregiver,"The wording indicates a conversational exchange with the caregiver, with no added details about topic, result, or timing. The main concept is a discussion-type communication involving the caregiver. This is a Situation concept and maps best to Discussed with caregiver (situation) [395084008]. 'Talked' is a common synonym for 'discussed' in clinical documentation and does not change the code selection. Broader or different communication concepts (e.g., informed, counseled, education provided) would be inaccurate because such attributes are not stated."
897347009,Patchy sclerosis of middle phalanx of foot (finding),Irregular sclerotic changes involving the middle phalanx of the foot,"‘Irregular sclerotic changes’ conveys a patchy sclerosis pattern, and the anatomy is the middle phalanx of the foot. The main concept is patchy sclerosis localized to the middle phalanx in the toes. Category: Clinical finding. SCTID 897347009 is appropriate because it represents patchy sclerosis of the middle phalanx of the foot specifically. Broader or different-location codes (e.g., proximal/distal phalanx) would be less precise. The phrasing does not add laterality or causation; it is a purely descriptive finding."
444946008,Dialysis fluid specimen obtained before dialysis (specimen),Predialysis dialysate specimen,"The main concept is a specimen of dialysate (a clinically standard synonym for dialysis fluid), with 'predialysis' indicating it was obtained before dialysis. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This precisely matches SCTID 444946008 because it combines the specimen type (dialysate) with the pre-dialysis timing. Using 'dialysate' does not change attributes and is semantically equivalent to 'dialysis fluid.' A broader parent concept would omit the timing, and siblings such as 'dialysis fluid specimen obtained during dialysis' would be inaccurate given the predialysis qualifier."
715158002,Accidental fall from skis (event),Discharge diagnosis mechanism: accidental fall from skis.,"This specifies the mechanism at discharge as an accidental fall from skis, which is an external cause Event. The exact SNOMED CT code is 715158002 Accidental fall from skis (event), since it captures both the accidental nature and the fall from skis. Parent concepts omit the skis mechanism and would reduce specificity, and sibling concepts for other equipment would not match. The documentation context does not change the underlying event concept."
230451000087106,Urine specimen obtained from incontinence sheath (specimen),"Patient: ""Urine was collected through the incontinence sheath""","This patient-reported statement clearly indicates the urine was collected through an incontinence sheath, establishing the specific source. The main concept is a urine specimen with an explicit external sheath collection method; no additional attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the most precise code is Urine specimen obtained from incontinence sheath (specimen), SCTID 230451000087106. Using a general urine specimen code would omit the method, and indwelling catheter siblings would misrepresent the external sheath. The phrasing is consistent with incontinence sheath collection without altering the concept."
286559005,Nephroscopic ureteric stent procedure (procedure),Nephroscopy-assisted ureteric stent procedure,"The phrase indicates that a ureteric stent procedure was assisted/performed via nephroscopy, which is equivalent to a nephroscopic approach. This is a Procedure and codes to 'Nephroscopic ureteric stent procedure' (286559005). It avoids specifying the action performed on the stent, preserving the general procedure concept. A broader parent without approach detail would be less specific, and children that name insertion/removal/exchange would add attributes not present. Sibling approaches (e.g., cystoscopic) are excluded by the explicit nephroscopy mention."
78521002,Holocentrus coruscus (organism),Holocentrus coruscus (organism),"This phrasing states the taxon name and clarifies it as an organism, matching the SNOMED CT Organism category. Category: Organism. SCTID 78521002 is the exact species-level concept, and the parent concepts (genus/family) would be less precise. The addition of '(organism)' is a descriptive label that does not change semantics or imply a different code. No attributes beyond naming the species are present."
737438001,Myocardial infarction clinical management plan (record artifact),Heart attack treatment plan,"The term “heart attack” is a widely accepted lay synonym for myocardial infarction, and “treatment plan” is clinically equivalent to “clinical management plan,” referring to a recorded plan of intended management. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This maps precisely to “Myocardial infarction clinical management plan (record artifact)” because it ties the plan to MI without adding subtypes or timing. Using the MI disorder code would be inappropriate, as this entry does not assert the disease per se; likewise, generic plan artifacts or protocol/order sets are less specific than a management plan targeted to MI. The synonym usage does not introduce additional attributes, preserving the exact concept."
411949009,Brassica napus specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Use during testing: Brassica napus allergen diagnostic extract,"The entry states use during testing of a Brassica napus allergen diagnostic extract, reinforcing it as a species-specific diagnostic product. The main concept is the diagnostic allergen extract product. SNOMED CT category: Product. It matches SCTID 411949009 since it emphasizes diagnostic use and correct species, without implying treatment or other species. Parent generic products would be less precise, and sibling concepts for therapeutic extracts or different species would be inaccurate. The testing context confirms diagnostic purpose without adding other attributes."
115697000,Chido-Rodgers Blood group system (qualifier value),Chido/Rodgers blood group system,"The slash variant “Chido/Rodgers” denotes the same combined blood group system in immunohematology. The concept type is Qualifier value. No mention of antigen expression, antibody reactivity, procedures, or results is present, making SCTID 115697000 the most accurate selection. A broader parent term would be less precise, and siblings like ABO or Rh, or separate Chido or Rodgers antigen concepts, would not match the combined system named here. The slash usage is a clinically equivalent synonym for the hyphenated form and does not change code selection."
24411000181107,Glutamicibacter soli (organism),Named organism is Glutamicibacter soli,"The sentence identifies the organism by name—Glutamicibacter soli—without stating any clinical context or attributes. In SNOMED CT, this falls under the Organism category, and the most specific code is 24411000181107. More generic parents like the genus or 'Bacteria' are not precise enough, and sibling species are different taxa. No site, infection, or temporal details are present; therefore, the organism concept is the appropriate selection."
328157002,L-Tyrosine powder (product),L-tyrosine powder preparation,"“Preparation” here denotes a product formulation, and paired with “L-tyrosine powder” it maps exactly to SNOMED CT 328157002 (Product). The main concept is a pharmaceutical/biologic product in powder dosage form; no dose, route, indication, or brand is implied. Broader parent concepts omit the powder form, while siblings for capsules, tablets, or solutions are excluded by the explicit powder reference. The synonym does not change the code selection and remains uniquely codable to the powder product."
76251002,Constructional apraxia (finding),Assessment: constructional apraxia.,"This entry records the assessment outcome as constructional apraxia, a Clinical finding. The correct SNOMED CT code is 76251002 since the wording identifies the constructional subtype explicitly. Using a broader apraxia concept or other apraxia categories would not be as precise. No additional attributes (e.g., severity, etiology) are added."
8055005,Galactoside acetyltransferase (substance),Galactoside acetyltransferase,"The entry names the enzyme galactoside acetyltransferase directly, which is a chemical/biologic substance. No attributes such as source, dose, timing, activity measurement, or clinical state are added. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance concept, and the most specific match is 8055005 Galactoside acetyltransferase (substance). Broader parents like Acetyltransferase (substance) or Enzyme (substance) are too general, and sibling enzymes (e.g., beta-galactosidase) are different entities. The wording does not indicate a procedure, diagnostic test, deficiency, or finding, so those categories would be inappropriate."
31154006,Prepaid private physicians' group office (environment),Discharged to prepaid private physicians' group office for visit,"This indicates disposition to an environment specified as a prepaid private physicians’ group office. The main concept captured for coding is the location; attributes include prepaid, private, physicians’ group, office. Category: Environment or geographical location. The phrase does not introduce alternative settings or qualifiers, so SCTID 31154006 is the best match. Broader parents or siblings with differing ownership/payment qualifiers would not be appropriate."
327997002,Foods for special diets (product),Record indicates foods for special diets provided,"A record stating that foods for special diets were provided still references the product class without adding specific dietary attributes. SNOMED CT category: Product. This fits 327997002 because it conveys the special-diet intent while remaining non-specific. Parent categories are too general, and child categories that define particular diets would be too narrow. The wording is an acceptable synonym and supports selection of the same code."
470512003,Anesthetist's trolley (physical object),Anesthetist's trolley,"The entry explicitly names the physical object used by an anesthetist, with no added attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The most precise match is SCTID 470512003 Anesthetist's trolley, as it specifies the trolley associated with anesthesia providers. More general parents like Trolley (physical object) are too nonspecific, and siblings such as Crash cart/Resuscitation trolley or Anesthesia machine/workstation describe different equipment. The wording is the exact preferred term, so it is a direct, unambiguous fit."
704106009,Advised to abstain from alcohol consumption (situation),Recommendation: do not consume alcohol.,"The core idea is a documented recommendation against any alcohol consumption, which expresses abstinence as advice. This is categorized as a Situation, indicating that guidance was given rather than describing a condition or procedure. SCTID 704106009 is the exact fit because the guidance is specifically to abstain from alcohol. Parent concepts that represent general recommendations lack the alcohol-specific abstinence detail, and children/siblings such as recommendations to reduce or avoid other substances are not appropriate. The phrasing “do not consume alcohol” is clinically equivalent to “abstain from alcohol” without adding timing or cause."
1303275005,Entire digital vessel of index finger (body structure),Digital vessel of second finger (index),"This entry clarifies 'second finger' as the index finger and identifies the digital vessel generically. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. SCTID 1303275005 is the most accurate match since no laterality or artery/vein subtype is introduced. A parent concept like 'structure of second finger' lacks vessel specificity, and child/sibling concepts specifying arteries or veins would over-specify beyond the text."
1379995006,Union for International Cancer Control aM1b (qualifier value),UICC TNM value selected: aM1b,"This indicates that in the UICC TNM staging system, the selected value is aM1b, the autopsy-specific M1b subclass. It is a Qualifier value. SNOMED CT code 1379995006 precisely represents Union for International Cancer Control aM1b. Parent or sibling concepts (generic M1b, cM1b, pM1b) are less appropriate. The phrasing is a neutral selection statement that does not change the concept."
770572002,Endoscopic ultrasound report (record artifact),Endoscopic ultrasound study report,"The entry indicates the report associated with an endoscopic ultrasound study. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. It is best coded to “Endoscopic ultrasound report (record artifact)” SCTID 770572002 because it denotes the documentation artifact for this specific modality and approach. It avoids introducing details like anatomical site or results. Parent or sibling report types lacking endoscopic ultrasound specificity would be less precise, and the corresponding procedure codes are not appropriate."
242709004,Accidentally caught in drying rack (event),Triage mechanism: accidental caught in drying rack.,"The triage note specifies the mechanism as accidental catching in a drying rack, maintaining focus on the incident itself without additional injury descriptors. This is an Event, best represented by SCTID 242709004. Parent concepts lacking the drying rack specificity or sibling events involving different devices would be less appropriate."
223590006,Lao People's Democratic Republic (geographic location),"Patient stated: ""Laos""","The patient-reported term “Laos” denotes Lao People's Democratic Republic, which is a geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (location), and SCTID 223590006 is the precise country code. The quotation and patient context do not introduce different attributes; the core concept is the country name. Regional, city-level, or nationality concepts are not referenced, confirming the country-level mapping."
328285005,Cystic fibrosis food (product),Cystic fibrosis food,"The main concept is a food product intended for individuals with cystic fibrosis, explicitly expressed as “cystic fibrosis food.” This belongs to the SNOMED CT Product hierarchy, specifically a food (product). SCTID 328285005 is the most precise match because it denotes a disease-targeted food product for cystic fibrosis. Broader parent concepts like generic “Food (product)” are less specific, and sibling or child concepts such as diet regimens, dietary supplements, or infant formulas would add attributes (e.g., regimen, supplement form, age group) not present in the entry. The wording directly aligns with the preferred term and does not introduce additional attributes."
257592000,Courthouse (environment),Court house,"This is a standardized spelling variant of 'Courthouse' and refers to the same physical setting—a building housing courts of law. The main concept remains an environment. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the exact code is Courthouse (environment) SCTID 257592000. Parent concepts like 'Public building' are too general, and sibling or child concepts such as 'Courtroom' would be overly specific. The spelling variation does not change the meaning or code selection."
464479008,Assistive make-up applicator (physical object),Assistive applicator for make-up,"This wording specifies an applicator with an assistive function for make-up use, which is a Physical object. It corresponds exactly to SNOMED CT 'Assistive make-up applicator' SCTID 464479008. A general 'make-up applicator' (non-assistive) would be a different concept, and broader assistive aids are not specific to make-up. No descriptive attributes such as material or powered status are present, supporting this exact code selection."
358355001,Acetate free continuous hemodialysis solution (product),"Patient states: ""They used acetate-free dialysate during continuous hemodialysis.""",A patient-reported context still clearly identifies the product: acetate-free dialysate used in continuous hemodialysis. The main concept remains the product with attributes acetate-free and continuous HD. SNOMED CT category: Product. SCTID 358355001 is the best fit. Choosing a parent like generic dialysate or siblings such as intermittent HD dialysate or acetate-containing dialysate would be less accurate. 'Dialysate' equals 'hemodialysis solution' and does not change code selection.
169581008,Antenatal care: grand multiparity (situation),Obstetric antenatal care: grand multiparity documented,"The phrasing specifies obstetric antenatal care with grand multiparity documented as the relevant patient factor, with no added attributes such as risk or complications. The main concepts are obstetric-focused antenatal care and grand multiparity. As a SNOMED CT Situation, it reflects care activity contextualized by parity status. It is more precise than the parent concept of antenatal care because it includes the grand multiparity qualifier; it does not correspond to a finding-only concept. The synonym “obstetric” simply identifies the specialty and does not change the situational coding."
787607005,Photographic image with lips closed (record artifact),Imaging report: photographic image with lips closed,"The entry, framed as an imaging report statement, identifies a photographic image and specifies that the lips are closed. It describes a Record artifact and aligns precisely with SNOMED CT SCTID 787607005. A parent artifact like 'Photographic image' lacks the closed-lips qualifier, while siblings with differing mouth states would miscode the description. The reporting context does not introduce new attributes; 'photographic image with lips closed' retains exact semantic equivalence."
66355007,Optic nerve sheath structure (body structure),Anatomic site: optic nerve sheath,"The wording identifies the optic nerve sheath as an anatomical site, which corresponds to the sheath structure around the optic nerve. Category: Body structure. It maps to SNOMED CT 'Optic nerve sheath structure' (66355007). No laterality, pathological status, or procedure is implied. A broader parent (optic nerve) is inappropriate because the site is specifically the sheath. Child concepts for layered or regional parts are not indicated. Siblings like optic nerve head are distinct sites. The phrase is equivalent and preserves the code."
1204484004,"Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands (geographic location)",Place name: Pitcairn–Henderson–Ducie–Oeno Islands,"“Place name” serves only as context; the core concept is the four-island group listed. Category: Geographic location. This matches SCTID 1204484004 exactly. Parent entries (e.g., island group without specifying which) or child/sibling singular islands would be less appropriate."
119326000,Hair specimen (specimen),Hair specimen,"The main concept expressed is a specimen consisting of hair. This is a SNOMED CT Specimen category concept and maps directly to Hair specimen (119326000). The wording is generic and does not introduce body site (e.g., scalp vs. pubic), method, timing, quantity, or purpose, so child concepts like scalp hair specimen or hair root specimen are not implied. Parent concepts such as Specimen or Body substance specimen are too broad, and sibling concepts like Nail specimen are incorrect. The term is a precise match for the intended code."
1254762008,Autologous adipose tissue reconstruction breast implant (physical object),Autologous fat breast reconstruction implant device,"The term 'autologous fat' is a clinically safe synonym for 'autologous adipose tissue,' and 'implant device' unambiguously indicates a physical object used for breast reconstruction. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This is more specific than a generic breast implant and excludes siblings (e.g., silicone/saline devices, tissue expanders). The entry does not imply a procedure or finding and avoids extra attributes like side, timing, or presence. It therefore maps most precisely to the autologous adipose tissue reconstruction breast implant concept."
441581000124101,Diabetic specialty enteral formula (product),Inventory: diabetes-specific enteral formula,"This inventory entry identifies a diabetes-specific enteral formula as a stocked product, matching Diabetic specialty enteral formula (product), SCTID 441581000124101. Main concept: diabetic specialty enteral formula; category: Product. “Diabetes-specific” equals “diabetic specialty” clinically and does not introduce details beyond the product identity. Parent enteral formula concepts omit the specialty attribute, and sibling disease specialties are not relevant. The entry does not indicate a feeding procedure or diet plan, ensuring the product concept is the precise mapping."
223878000,Essex (geographic location),Essex (geographic location),"The entry explicitly uses the semantic tag, stating Essex as a geographic location, with no extra clinical attributes. Category: Geographic location. This directly matches the SNOMED PT Essex (geographic location) SCTID 223878000, avoiding broader parents like England/UK and narrower children (towns in Essex). It also distinguishes from sibling entities with similar names in other regions."
1003796001,Transuterine migration (finding),Clinician assessment: transuterine migration,"In a clinician assessment context, the documented finding is transuterine migration. The phrase does not introduce cause, subject, severity, or timing attributes. As such, Transuterine migration (finding), SCTID 1003796001, within the Clinical finding hierarchy, is the most accurate SNOMED CT concept. Parent or sibling concepts that imply a specific entity or condition are excluded by the general wording."
41684000,"Industrial tool, device (physical object)",Industrial tool/device,"The entry names the object as an industrial tool/device, directly matching the SNOMED CT concept “Industrial tool, device (physical object)” (SCTID 41684000). No attributes such as power source, handheld status, function, laterality, or clinical context are added. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. This is more precise than parent concepts like “Device (physical object)” or “Tool (physical object)” because the modifier ‘industrial’ is specified, and it does not point to a child concept such as “Power tool” or “Machine tool.” The wording is a clinically equivalent restatement of the preferred term and thus selects the same code."
58889009,Laser retinopexy (procedure),Ophthalmic procedure: laser retinopexy,"The term identifies the ophthalmic procedure as laser retinopexy, which corresponds to Laser retinopexy. This is a Procedure category in SNOMED CT; the most accurate code is 58889009. Using a broader ophthalmic laser procedure concept would be too generic, and alternative retinopexy techniques are separate sibling procedures. The contextual phrase 'ophthalmic procedure' does not alter the concept or add attributes; the essential idea remains retinopexy via laser."
215234003,Knocked down by animal-drawn vehicle (event),Event: knocked down by an animal-drawn vehicle,"Labeling it as an ‘Event’ aligns with the SNOMED CT semantic tag, while the description specifies knockdown by an animal-drawn vehicle. SCTID 215234003 is the correct match since the agent and mechanism are aligned with the concept. More general parents or alternative siblings (collision, fall, run over) do not match the explicit knockdown mechanism stated."
224711002,Downstairs (environment),Setting: downstairs,"The phrase uses a general context label ""Setting:"" and specifies ""downstairs"", expressing only the environmental location. Within SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Environment or geographical location category and corresponds to Downstairs (environment), SCTID 224711002. The label does not add room type, activity, or timing; broader parent concepts are too general, and siblings like Upstairs are not mentioned. This is a clinically equivalent way to denote the downstairs environment, justifying 224711002."
386363001,Administration of drug or medicament via vaginal route (procedure),Administered medicament via vaginal route,"This phrasing states that a medicament was administered and gives the route as vaginal. It captures the procedure without naming a drug, dose, indication, or timing. The appropriate SNOMED CT category is Procedure, with concept 386363001 matching the vaginal route administration. Broader parents omit the route, and siblings for other routes are not suitable. 'Medicament' is a clinically equivalent synonym of 'drug/medication' and does not change the mapping."
396958005,Size of base of tumor on transillumination (observable entity),Document the size of the tumor base on transillumination,"Although phrased as an instruction, the underlying concept remains the observable entity: the size of the tumor base assessed via transillumination. This fits SCTID 396958005 precisely, including both the base of the tumor and the transillumination method. Parent concepts without the method or alternate observables (e.g., overall tumor size) are less specific. The phrase is equivalent in meaning and does not add any further attributes such as value ranges or timing."
48924007,"Excision of preauricular appendage, remnant (procedure)",Excision of preauricular ear tag,"This entry documents the excision of an 'ear tag' specified as preauricular, which is clinically synonymous with a preauricular appendage/remnant. The main concept is an excision Procedure of the preauricular appendage. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It most precisely aligns with 48924007 because it identifies both the target (preauricular appendage/tag) and the action (excision). Broader external ear procedures or different preauricular conditions (e.g., sinus) would not match as closely."
297239000,Family history of neurological disorder (situation),Documented family history of neurologic disease,"This entry states that a neurologic disease is documented in the family history, with no specific subtype or relative specified. The main concept is an affirmative family history concerning neurological disease, a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 297239000 is the most accurate code because it captures family history of neurological disorder generically. Parent concepts are less specific, and child/sibling concepts for named conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis) are not indicated. 'Neurologic disease' is a clinically equivalent synonym for neurological disorder."
420391008,Ohio (geographic location),Geographic location: Ohio,"The label “Geographic location” clarifies semantic type; the coded entity is Ohio, aligning with Ohio (geographic location), SCTID 420391008. Main concept: place. Category: Qualifier value—Geographic location. It does not broaden to the nation or narrow to a city/county, therefore the Ohio concept is exact."
162653005,One or more organs examined (situation),Organ examination performed (one or more),"The content indicates that an examination at the organ level was carried out and makes explicit that the count is one or more. The primary concept is a situation statement about organ examination status. SNOMED CT 162653005 is the precise match because it reflects the one-or-more threshold without specifying exact number or identity. Child concepts for exactly one or multiple organs would not be supported by the phrasing, and siblings like no organ examined are directly refuted. The synonym 'examination performed' aligns with 'examined' and does not alter code selection."
262430003,Machiguenga (qualifier value),Machiguenga people (patient),"This entry states that the patient belongs to the Machiguenga people, which is the same ethnic group concept and aligns with SNOMED CT 262430003 (Qualifier value). The concept is purely an identity qualifier; no clinical attributes are present. The category is Qualifier value as it is used to denote ethnicity in records. A general parent loses specificity, and siblings represent different peoples. The wording does not suggest language or geographic location, ensuring exact mapping."
1343696006,Fenestrated tracheostomy tube (physical object),Fenestrated trach tube,"This is a clinically standard abbreviation (“trach”) for tracheostomy and directly names the fenestrated tube, without any additional qualifiers (e.g., cuff, size, material). The main concept is a fenestrated tracheostomy device. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The best match is Fenestrated tracheostomy tube (physical object), SCTID 1343696006. A generic tracheostomy tube parent would lose the fenestration attribute, and specifying cuff or other features would move to a more specific child not supported by the wording. The abbreviation does not change semantics or code selection."
262455009,Navet (qualifier value),SNOMED CT qualifier: Navet,"This entry explicitly names 'Navet' as a SNOMED CT qualifier, pointing directly to the qualifier value concept. No other clinical attributes are present. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 262455009 is the precise code; using a generic 'Qualifier value' or another named qualifier would not be exact. The wording is a direct identification and does not change semantics."
285323007,Non-ionizing radiation (physical force),Non-ionizing radiation (physical force),"This entry reproduces the preferred term with its hierarchy indication, explicitly identifying the physical agent. No additional attributes are present. The category is Physical force, and the precise code is 285323007. Parent concepts like Radiation (physical force) are less specific, while children such as UV radiation would be overly specific and not stated. The wording unambiguously matches the given SNOMED concept."
411772002,Rubus fruticosus diagnostic allergen extract (product),Rubus fruticosus diagnostic test allergen preparation,"This wording names a diagnostic test allergen preparation derived from Rubus fruticosus, describing a product used in allergy diagnostics. The category is Product. It matches SCTID 411772002 due to the species specificity and diagnostic purpose. It avoids specifying route, dose form, concentration, or a particular testing modality, preventing unintended mapping to child or procedural concepts. A general diagnostic allergen extract (parent) would be less precise, and siblings for therapeutic use or other species would be wrong."
48120004,Cancer hospital (environment),Transfer to the cancer hospital,"This entry documents a transfer to a hospital dedicated to cancer care, aligning with Cancer hospital (environment) [48120004] in the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. The transfer context leaves the location concept unchanged and adds no qualifiers such as level or ownership. Parent Hospital (environment) lacks specialization, while siblings like Oncology clinic or Cancer center misstate the facility type relative to the explicit term hospital."
272476000,Transthoracic projection (qualifier value),Transthoracic view,"This entry uses “view” as a clinically standard synonym for projection, maintaining the same meaning as the preferred term. The main concept remains the projection pathway through the thorax. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It does not specify a modality or a specific view subtype, avoiding misclassification to procedures like transthoracic echocardiography or to chest X-ray techniques (AP/PA). Therefore, SCTID 272476000 is the precise match rather than a parent (projection unspecified) or a sibling/child projection."
401635007,Compression hosiery class II kneecap circular knit made to measure (physical object),Tailor-made class II kneecap round-knit compression hosiery,"This phrase describes a physical object: compression hosiery with class II compression, designed around the kneecap, produced using round-knit (synonymous with circular-knit) construction, and tailor-made (equivalent to made to measure). The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 401635007 is the best fit because it captures all stated attributes. Broader parents omit key modifiers like kneecap focus or custom fabrication, and siblings differ by compression class or knit type (e.g., flat-knit). The synonyms “round-knit” and “tailor-made” are clinically safe equivalents that retain the same coding intent."
702869004,Incident site (environment),Incident site (environment),"This entry exactly mirrors the SNOMED CT preferred term and semantic tag, stating the environmental site of an incident without added qualifiers. The category is Environment or geographical location, and the exact code match is Incident site (environment) [702869004]. There is no basis to select a parent (too generic) or a child/sibling (too specific). The wording is identical to the concept name, confirming precise coding."
400496008,Low protein gluten free egg white replacer (product),Reduced-protein gluten-free egg white replacement product,"The entry denotes a product used to replace egg white, with explicit attributes of reduced-protein (synonymous with low-protein) and gluten-free. The main concept is a Product; attributes: low protein and gluten-free. This is best coded as 'Low protein gluten free egg white replacer (product)' (400496008). Using 'reduced-protein' does not alter the intended attribute compared to 'low-protein'. More general parents (egg white replacer without dietary qualifiers) or siblings (whole egg replacer) lack one or more of the specified characteristics, making them less appropriate."
70818006,"Complement activation classic pathway, function (observable entity)",Data field: classical complement pathway function,"This label indicates a data element capturing the function of the classical complement pathway, without presenting measurement results or actions. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. The most precise code is 70818006 'Complement activation classic pathway, function (observable entity).' A general complement function observable would not reflect pathway specificity, and siblings for other pathways are not applicable. The 'Data field' context does not alter the observable or introduce new attributes."
398224002,Guardian interview performed (situation),Guardian interview carried out.,"Stating the guardian interview was 'carried out' confirms performance of the interview and matches 'Guardian interview performed' (398224002). Category: Situation. There are no added attributes such as method, timing, or outcomes, keeping the concept limited to the occurrence of the interview. Parent or sibling concepts that are broader or involve different subjects would be less specific. 'Carried out' is a valid synonym for performed/completed and maintains the same code."
242140002,Fall while boarding or alighting from off-road land motor vehicle (event),Event: fall associated with boarding/alighting an off-road land motor vehicle,"This entry identifies an event consisting of a fall associated with boarding or alighting an off-road land motor vehicle, which exactly corresponds to SNOMED CT 242140002 (Event). The core attributes—fall, boarding/alighting phase, and off-road land motor vehicle—are present. More general parent concepts fail to capture the boarding/alighting and vehicle specificity, while any child concepts that specify only boarding or only alighting, or name a particular vehicle type, would be overly narrow relative to the wording. The use of “boarding/alighting” is fully synonymous with the concept’s phrasing, keeping code selection unchanged."
297354008,Nogai language (qualifier value),Intake language: Nogai,"The entry situates the language designation within an intake context while the value remains 'Nogai,' corresponding to the SNOMED CT qualifier value 'Nogai language' (SCTID: 297354008). It introduces no attributes such as fluency, preference, or dialect. The SNOMED category is Qualifier value. Parent or sibling language concepts would be less precise, so the given concept is the correct code."
135822005,Lipid lowering therapy contraindicated (situation),Antilipidemic therapy contraindicated,"This statement indicates a contraindication to therapies aimed at reducing lipids, synonymous with lipid-lowering therapy. The concept is a Situation with explicit context and corresponds to SNOMED CT 135822005. It does not introduce any causal or temporal attributes nor narrow to a specific agent class, avoiding misclassification to child concepts such as statin-only contraindication. It is more specific than a generic therapy contraindication parent and remains distinct from siblings like intolerance or refusal."
218073006,Accident caused by explosion of pressure gas tank (event),Accident caused by explosion of pressure gas tank,"The entry explicitly states an accidental event with the causal mechanism being an explosion of a pressure gas tank, matching the preferred term. The main concept is an accident due to the explosion of a pressurized gas container. SNOMED CT category: Event. This wording corresponds exactly to SCTID 218073006. Broader parents such as generic explosion accidents, or siblings like explosion of other pressure vessels, would be less precise. The phrasing does not introduce additional attributes (e.g., injury details, location), keeping it uniquely codable to this event."
738344001,Bioelectric wound dressing (physical object),Bioelectric wound dressing present,"The statement indicates the object is present: a bioelectric wound dressing. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, pointing to SCTID 738344001. Coding up to a generic Wound dressing would lose the bioelectric property, and coding to siblings (e.g., silver dressings) would mischaracterize the device. No additional attributes are included, and there is no procedural language—this is strictly the object."
243876005,Screening status (finding),Screening status — diagnostic report,"Here the context is a diagnostic report, but the concept remains a finding about screening status. There are no specifics on type, result, or decision, so Screening status (finding) [243876005] is the correct Clinical finding code. Selecting a procedural code or a child indicating overdue/declined would add details not present in the entry."
44174001,Fetal death from asphyxia AND/OR anoxia before onset of labor (event),Intrauterine fetal demise before labor due to anoxia,"The entry indicates fetal death in utero (IUFD), clarifies the timing (before labor), and specifies the mechanism (anoxia), aligning exactly with SCTID 44174001. Category: Event. 'IUFD' is a common clinical synonym for fetal death; pairing it with 'before labor' and 'anoxia' ensures it does not drift to a broader parent or a sibling like intrapartum death. No additional attributes are introduced."
411712005,Levisticum officinale diagnostic allergen extract (product),Levisticum officinale allergen extract for diagnostic testing,"The entry conveys a product that is an allergen extract from Levisticum officinale intended specifically for diagnostic testing. The main concept is a Product, with attributes limited to source (Levisticum officinale) and diagnostic purpose. This matches SCTID 411712005 exactly. A parent concept would omit the specific allergen, and a sibling such as a therapeutic allergen extract would add a treatment role that is not present. The phrase “for diagnostic testing” restates diagnostic intent without adding other attributes like route or concentration, preserving code precision."
415189005,Pseudomonas cedrina (organism),Lab organism entry: Pseudomonas cedrina,"This entry indicates the organism recorded in the laboratory context is Pseudomonas cedrina, focusing on the taxon name. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 415189005 is the correct species-level code. The lab context does not add attributes such as infection, specimen site, or resistance; it only frames the organism identification. A generic Pseudomonas code or a different species would not match the specific organism named."
405135001,Parenting behavior: psychosocial safety (observable entity),Parental behavior regarding psychosocial safety,"The entry expresses parental behavior with respect to psychosocial safety, which is the same domain as 'Parenting behavior: psychosocial safety.' Category is Observable entity. It does not claim outcomes, adequacy, or risk, so it avoids mapping to a clinical finding or disorder. The statement is more precise than a generic parent-level parenting behavior and does not reflect other domains such as physical or environmental safety, ensuring it aligns with 405135001."
726697001,Referral to psychiatrist declined by subject (situation),Patient declined a referral to see a psychiatrist.,"This conveys that the patient declined being referred to see a psychiatrist, a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 726697001 is the correct and most specific code because the refusal is tied to a psychiatrist referral. More general or different-provider referral refusal concepts would be less accurate. The addition of ‘to see’ maintains the same meaning and does not introduce extra attributes."
223376007,Gomera (geographic location),Location: La Gomera,"This format indicates the geographic location as La Gomera, which is an equivalent naming of the Gomera island. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location, and the correct code is Gomera (geographic location) | 223376007. The contextual label “Location:” does not introduce new attributes; it simply frames the place name in documentation. No broader regional reference or sublocality is provided, thereby avoiding parent or child concepts and ensuring unique mapping to the target location."
270928004,Serum zinc protoporphyrin (procedure),History list item: serum zinc protoporphyrin,"Listed in a history section, this identifies the serum zinc protoporphyrin procedure, which is a Procedure. It precisely maps to Serum zinc protoporphyrin (procedure), SCTID 270928004, by specifying the serum specimen. Broader parent concepts (e.g., laboratory history or unspecified ZnPP measurement) lack the specificity, and siblings such as erythrocyte ZPP or ZPP/heme ratio are not appropriate due to the explicit serum matrix. The history context is metadata and does not change the underlying procedure being referenced."
43674008,Apical (qualifier value),Apically oriented,"The entry uses the adverbial form ""apically"" to indicate orientation, which is semantically equivalent to the apical positional qualifier. This is a Qualifier value and aligns with Apical (qualifier value) [43674008]. No organ or other attributes are introduced, so a body structure apex mapping would be overly specific. Sibling or parent qualifiers are not suggested by the wording. The phrasing remains a pure expression of the apical qualifier."
362709007,Entire mesentery of colon (body structure),Whole colonic mesentery,"This entry uses 'whole' as a clinically equivalent synonym for 'entire' and 'colonic mesentery' as a synonym for 'mesentery of colon.' No additional attributes or regional qualifiers are present. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. 'Entire mesentery of colon (body structure)' SCTID 362709007 is the correct code because it captures the anatomical structure in its entirety; the more general 'Mesentery of colon' omits the completeness qualifier, and region-specific mesocolon terms would be overly narrow."
12511000087107,Computed tomography arthrography of left lower limb (procedure),Left lower limb CT arthrography study,"The wording indicates a CT arthrography study of the left lower limb, capturing modality, technique, laterality, and region, matching SNOMED CT 12511000087107 within the Procedure category. It does not specify a single joint, thus avoiding child concepts, and it isn’t a generic CT arthrography without site, avoiding the parent. It excludes other modalities like MR and non-arthrographic CT. The term “study” does not add extra attributes beyond the procedure itself."
718697007,Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score (observable entity),Lysholm knee scoring result (Lysholm score),"The entry highlights the result of Lysholm scoring and reiterates the score label. The concept is the observable Lysholm score without added attributes. Category: Observable entity. SCTID 718697007 precisely matches because it encodes the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score. Parent or sibling concepts like general outcomes, other knee scales, or the instrument/procedure are less fitting. The synonyms used are clinically equivalent and maintain the same code."
223532001,East African country (geographic location),Nationality documented as an East African country,"Context is nationality, but the geographic concept expressed is a country in East Africa, unspecified beyond subregion. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. 'Country' and 'nation' are equivalent here, so SCTID 223532001 applies. Parent concepts without the East African qualifier are too broad, children naming particular countries are too narrow, and regional siblings (East Africa) do not denote a country."
702929001,Vertigo clinic (environment),Vertigo clinic facility,"This entry names the facility as a vertigo clinic, which is a healthcare environment. The main concept is the location/setting, not any diagnostic or procedural attribute. It fits the SNOMED CT Environment category and maps to Vertigo clinic (environment) SCTID 702929001. A parent like generic clinic facility would be too broad, and siblings for other specialty clinics would be inaccurate. The addition of 'facility' is a semantically equivalent descriptor and does not introduce new attributes."
288520005,City environment (environment),City setting,"The term 'setting' denotes the environmental context and is specified as city, aligning with the Environment category in SNOMED CT. City environment (environment) [288520005] is the exact match. Parent environment concepts would be nonspecific, and child or sibling variants (e.g., inner-city, suburban) are not stated. The wording does not introduce residence or facility attributes, so it remains a pure environmental descriptor, making the chosen concept most appropriate."
218113001,Accident caused by explosion of methane (event),Accident resulting due to methane explosion,"Despite minor stylistic redundancy, the concept is an accident resulting from a methane explosion, fitting SNOMED CT Event 218113001. It provides substance specificity and avoids extra attributes such as injury details or timing. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings involving other gases are incorrect given the explicit methane reference. The causal phrasing remains equivalent to “caused by.”"
25810004,Zieria arborescens (organism),Reference organism: Zieria arborescens,"Framed as a reference organism, the entry still denotes the species Zieria arborescens and aligns with SNOMED CT Organism concept 25810004. The contextual term “reference” does not imply exposure, effect, or product usage. Parent taxa are too general and sibling species are not suggested, so the species-level concept remains the precise selection."
427510007,Product containing protein kinase inhibitor (product),Protein kinase inhibitor product,"The text explicitly names a product that contains a protein kinase inhibitor, identifying the main concept as a pharmaceutical/biologic product category rather than a specific ingredient or therapy. No dose, route, brand, indication, timing, or patient usage is stated. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with the Product semantic tag, specifically the concept ‘Product containing protein kinase inhibitor (product)’ SCTID 427510007. More general parent concepts like ‘Pharmaceutical product’ would be too broad, and child concepts naming specific agents (e.g., imatinib-containing product) or subclasses (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor product) would be too narrow. The wording is a direct synonym of the preferred term and does not introduce additional attributes."
8489003,Aedes kochi (organism),Diagnostic record: Aedes kochi,"The entry references a diagnostic record that names the species Aedes kochi. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The appropriate code is 8489003 for Aedes kochi. More general taxa (Aedes or mosquito) are parents and too broad, and other Aedes species would be siblings and incorrect. No extra attributes like life stage, location, or disease linkage are introduced."
1295465005,Plain X-ray of gland with contrast (procedure),Contrast-assisted X-ray imaging of a gland,"This wording describes X-ray imaging of a gland assisted by contrast. Main concepts: modality = X-ray (plain radiography), target = gland (unspecified), attribute = with contrast. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 1295465005 is the appropriate code because it captures a plain X-ray of a gland with contrast, with no additional attributes like laterality or specific gland named. Parent concepts without contrast do not reflect the specified attribute. Child concepts that define the gland site would be too narrow. Sibling concepts with other imaging modalities are incorrect here. The paraphrase remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
417380003,Membranous balance of dura mater (finding),Balanced membranous tension of dura mater,"The term explicitly conveys that the dural membrane’s membranous tension is in a balanced state, which is synonymous with membranous balance of the dura mater. This remains a Clinical finding and does not add severity or other qualifiers. A parent concept would be less specific, while sibling/child concepts like increased, decreased, or strained dural tension are not described. Therefore, SCTID 417380003 is the most precise code."
246889007,General appearance of limbal conjunctiva (observable entity),Overall appearance of limbal conjunctival tissue,"This wording emphasizes the same property—overall/general appearance—focused on limbal conjunctival tissue. It is an Observable entity, as it names the parameter without any qualitative result. Broader parents lack the limbal specificity, and child/sibling concepts introducing abnormal descriptors or different anatomical areas would be mismatches. The synonymic phrasing remains clinically equivalent to 'general appearance' and preserves the intended code."
771109008,Structure of right facet joint of thoracic spine (body structure),Right-sided facet joint of the thoracic spine,"This phrase clearly identifies the right laterality and thoracic spinal location of the facet joint, which is an anatomical structure. The most precise SNOMED CT match is 'Structure of right facet joint of thoracic spine' (771109008). Parent concepts that do not include laterality are more general, and sibling concepts with left laterality or in alternate spinal regions would not match. The absence of level-specific detail or clinical modifiers avoids mapping to child or finding/procedure concepts."
470328007,Gastric electrical stimulation system pulse generator (physical object),Pulse generator for gastric electrical stimulation system,"This entry explicitly defines the pulse generator as belonging to the gastric electrical stimulation system, exactly matching 470328007 in the Physical object domain. It specifies the component role (pulse generator) and the system type (gastric), avoiding broader or different device parts. No additional attributes such as location or procedural context are added, ensuring precise mapping to the component-level concept rather than a parent system or related child device."
86971008,Closure of ventricular septal defect with pulmonary valvotomy and patch (procedure),Repair of ventricular septal defect using patch with pulmonary valvotomy,"This phrase indicates repair (closure) of a VSD using a patch and includes a pulmonary valvotomy. The main concepts are VSD patch closure and pulmonary valvotomy. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 86971008 is the most precise because it encodes both patch closure of the VSD and pulmonary valvotomy. A parent like generic 'VSD repair' would be underspecified if it omits the patch or valvotomy, and a sibling like 'VSD patch closure' alone would fail to capture the valvotomy. 'Repair' here is a clinically equivalent synonym for closure and does not change code selection."
360241008,Infrared probe (physical object),IR probe,"The entry states “IR probe,” with IR being a commonly used abbreviation for infrared; thus the main concept is an infrared probe. This is a Physical object/device in SNOMED CT, matching SCTID 360241008. Parent concepts like generic “Probe (device)” lack the infrared characteristic, while siblings such as “Infrared sensor” or “Infrared camera” represent different devices and functions. The abbreviation does not add or change attributes, so it is a clinically equivalent synonym for the preferred concept."
14867001,Radulinus vinculus (organism),Taxon: Radulinus vinculus (organism),"This entry explicitly states the taxon Radulinus vinculus and clarifies it as an organism, ensuring the species is the focal concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It corresponds exactly to SCTID 14867001 for the species Radulinus vinculus. Using the genus or a generic organism concept would reduce specificity, and any sibling species would be incorrect. The parenthetical descriptor does not add new attributes; it reinforces the organism context, validating the species-level code."
224715006,House extension (environment),House addition,"The concept is an addition attached to the house, equivalent to a house extension. No attributes beyond the existence of the addition are present. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. SCTID 224715006 is the exact match as it describes the environmental feature of a house having an extension. Parent terms such as house/dwelling would not be specific enough, and siblings like annex or outbuilding denote different structures. The synonym 'addition' does not introduce new detail and remains within scope."
720449003,Pulmonary function report (record artifact),Pulmonary function lab report,"This denotes a report produced by the lab regarding pulmonary function testing, which is an artifact document. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact, with Pulmonary function report (record artifact) [720449003] as the most precise code. The mention of “lab” is context and does not alter clinical attributes or specify subtests such as spirometry. It is not the procedure itself and is more specific than a generic diagnostic report. The synonym remains within the same conceptual scope."
223601009,Maldives (geographic location),Country of interest: Maldives,"This entry points to Maldives as the country of interest, still only naming the national-level geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Location/Geographic location. SCTID 223601009 is the correct code, as it directly represents the Maldives. The wording does not introduce subnational areas (children) or suggest other countries (siblings), and a generic country parent would be less specific. No extra clinical or temporal attributes are added."
359575000,Gastrectomy with jejunal transposition (procedure),Operative note: gastrectomy performed with jejunal transposition reconstruction,"This operative documentation indicates the procedure performed: gastrectomy with a reconstructive transposition of the jejunum. No qualifiers such as total vs partial or approach are added. It is a Procedure. SCTID 359575000 is the precise code because it captures both components. Parent concepts (gastrectomy alone) or sibling reconstructions (e.g., colonic interposition, Roux-en-Y) would be less accurate. The added word 'reconstruction' simply clarifies purpose and does not alter the procedural identity."
226198003,Cow's milk-free diet (finding),Continues on a cow's milk-free diet,"This follow-up phrasing documents ongoing exclusion of cow’s milk from the diet, with no added cause or severity. The SNOMED category is Clinical finding. SCTID 226198003 is the precise match because it encodes the cow’s milk-free dietary status; broader or different sibling concepts (dairy-free, lactose-free) and procedural orders would not reflect the stated finding."
431317006,Coronal approach (qualifier value),Approach noted as coronal,"This phrasing records the approach as coronal, mapping directly to Coronal approach (qualifier value) SCTID 431317006. Main concept: specific approach; no body site, timing, or procedural details are added. Category: Qualifier value. The note-taking context does not change the attribute value; a broader parent would be underspecified, and no alternative sibling is mentioned."
108665006,Product containing hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system inhibitor (product),Acid secretion proton pump inhibitor medication,"This describes a medication that inhibits acid secretion via the proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase), consistent with PPIs. Category: Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It aligns with SCTID 108665006 by denoting a product containing a proton pump inhibitor without details of dose or ingredient. Parent categories like acid suppression medications are broader and include H2 antagonists; child products naming a specific PPI would be too specific. The phrasing is a clinically equivalent synonym and maintains the same code."
285088009,Railway tunnel (environment),EMS scene: railway tunnel,"Prehospital documentation marks the EMS scene as a railway tunnel. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. Railway tunnel (environment) [285088009] is the correct code, given the rail-based tunnel specification. ‘EMS scene’ is contextual and does not introduce other attributes; parent/sibling tunnel concepts lack the necessary rail specificity."
1208372007,Western Sahara (geographic location),Western Sahara (geographic location),"The entry explicitly names 'Western Sahara' and clarifies the semantic tag by stating '(geographic location)', aligning exactly with SNOMED CT Western Sahara (geographic location), SCTID 1208372007. The core concept is the location itself; no other attributes are asserted. The category is Geographic location within the Location hierarchy. Parent concepts (continent or regional groupings) and sibling places are not invoked, and no subregions or cities are specified, keeping the selection at the precise territorial level intended by the code. The parenthetical descriptor is a neutral clarification that preserves equivalence."
410652009,Blood product (product),Blood product — patient-mentioned term,"Even in a patient-reported context, the term being referenced is the general product class 'blood product' without subtype or event. SNOMED CT category: Product. Code 410652009 best fits the object referenced. Mapping to 'history of transfusion' or procedure codes would misrepresent the entry, as no administration is stated. Child component products are not specified and broader product parents are too general."
236473000,Entire interosseous metatarsal spaces (body structure),Entire intermetatarsal spaces,"“Intermetatarsal spaces” is a common clinical synonym for the interosseous spaces between metatarsals; “entire” indicates the aggregate. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. This is clinically equivalent to “interosseous metatarsal spaces” and does not add attributes such as laterality or numbering. A broader parent like “intermetatarsal space” (without “entire”) could imply a single space, which is less precise. Child concepts that target specific numbered intermetatarsal spaces are too specific. Siblings involving metacarpal anatomy or cutaneous interdigital areas are different structures and therefore inappropriate."
251922005,Maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (observable entity),PFT report item: maximum mid-expiratory flow rate,"Within a PFT report, the item named is “maximum mid-expiratory flow rate,” clearly designating the observable entity measured. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. Referencing the report context does not add procedural coding; the parameter itself maps to SCTID 251922005. It excludes broader parents and distinct siblings such as peak expiratory flow rate or mean mid-expiratory flow rate. There are no added values or interpretations."
1187608004,History of dishonorable discharge from military service (situation),Past history: dishonorable discharge (military).,"This phrasing conveys a prior status—dishonorable discharge—specifically in the military context. The concept is a historical situation, making SNOMED CT code 1187608004 the accurate selection. The use of 'past history' does not introduce any additional attributes beyond the inherent 'history of' aspect. A parent concept about general military discharge history would be too broad, while child or sibling concepts specifying different types of discharge (e.g., honorable, general, bad conduct) would be incorrect. The term remains semantically equivalent to the preferred concept without adding cause, timing detail, or branch."
470071008,Lower-limb mechanical weight exerciser (physical object),Lower-extremity mechanical weight-training device,"The entry unambiguously refers to a device that provides mechanical weight-based exercise for the lower extremity (lower limb). The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (Device). SCTID 470071008 is the most precise code because it represents a lower-limb mechanical weight exerciser. A broader device category or a device specified for a different body region would be less appropriate. The synonym “lower-extremity” is clinically equivalent to “lower limb,” preserving the same concept scope."
372760009,Protriptyline (substance),Protriptyline stated during visit,"This visit note captures the name protriptyline, with no additional attributes such as dose, route, salt, brand, timing, or indication. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Protriptyline (substance), SCTID 372760009, is the correct and specific match, as it reflects the active drug ingredient referenced. Choosing a parent like antidepressant substances would reduce specificity, and selecting a salt or product concept (e.g., protriptyline hydrochloride or tablets) would add formulation details not provided. The visit context is neutral and maintains the substance focus."
80637009,Isolation of ileal loop (procedure),Isolation of ileal loop,"The entry explicitly names the procedure: isolation of a loop of the ileum. The main medical concept is a procedural intervention on the ileum, and there are no added attributes such as purpose, timing, or associated reconstructive steps. In SNOMED CT, this is a Procedure and maps precisely to SCTID 80637009. Parent concepts like generic intestinal loop isolation would be too broad, and sibling or child concepts such as jejunal loop isolation, ileal resection, or creation of an ileal conduit introduce different anatomic sites or additional procedural actions not stated here. The wording matches the preferred term, ensuring the most exact code selection."
726566009,Pathology biopsy report (record artifact),Anatomic path biopsy report,"This entry states an anatomic pathology biopsy report, which is a document in the record artifact hierarchy. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. ""Anatomic path"" is standard shorthand for anatomic pathology and is clinically equivalent; the inclusion of ""biopsy report"" ensures the specificity matches Pathology biopsy report. Using a parent like anatomic pathology report would be too general, and siblings such as cytology report or surgical resection report would misrepresent the specimen type or context. No additional attributes are present."
223821008,Cos (geographic location),Destination: Cos,"The context of “destination” frames the entry, but the coded concept is the place Cos. Category: Location (geographic location). No other geographic scope or qualifiers are present, making 223821008 Cos (geographic location) the exact match and excluding broader areas or town-level siblings."
40513000,Atmospheric pressure (observable entity),Atmospheric pressure,"The entry names the environmental air pressure parameter itself without any values or interpretation. This corresponds to the SNOMED CT concept Atmospheric pressure (observable entity), SCTID 40513000, which represents the property that can be observed or measured. Using the plain term ensures we are coding the observable entity rather than a measurement procedure or a finding about its level. Broader parents like Pressure (observable entity) would be less specific, and siblings such as room pressure or underwater ambient pressure are not implied here."
223740009,Regions of Indonesia (geographic location),Geographic location—Regions of Indonesia,"A documentation header “Geographic location—” precedes the concept, but the coded term is unchanged: “Regions of Indonesia.” The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The wording avoids broader or narrower concepts, staying at the regional group level within Indonesia. The contextual label does not introduce additional attributes; thus, 223740009 is the correct and most specific code."
726887008,Entire subserosal tissue of liver (body structure),Mapping to entire hepatic subserosal tissue,"The entry states a mapping to the whole hepatic subserosal tissue, identifying the complete subserosal layer of the liver. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. It matches SCTID 726887008 because 'entire' ensures full extent and 'hepatic' specifies the organ. The phrase 'Mapping to' is contextual and does not change the anatomical target. Parent concepts are less exact, and siblings pertaining to other tissues are not referenced."
257215003,Nail instrument (physical object),Clinical nail instrument,"Adding 'clinical' situates the instrument in clinical use but does not change the object’s identity as a nail instrument. Category: Physical object. The entry does not introduce any characteristics that would require a more specific code. Parent concepts like general instruments are less precise, and child devices naming particular nail tools would over-specify beyond the wording."
429319003,Product containing aminotransferase inhibitor (product),Prescription label class: aminotransferase inhibitor medicinal product,"This describes the product class as it would appear on a prescription label, identifying a medicinal product that contains an aminotransferase inhibitor. It maps to SNOMED CT 429319003 and belongs to the Product hierarchy. The label context does not imply administration or ordering as a procedure; it simply characterizes the product class. Substance-only, therapeutic procedure, or more specific branded/ingredient children are less appropriate for this generic product description."
310147001,Pediatric dentistry service (qualifier value),Service type: pediatric dentistry service,"The entry explicitly labels the type of service as pediatric dentistry, which corresponds to a service classification qualifier. This aligns with SNOMED CT 310147001 Pediatric dentistry service (qualifier value). Broader parent qualifiers like Dental service fail to capture pediatric specificity, and related specialty or provider concepts are not service qualifiers. No additional clinical attributes are introduced by this phrasing."
736508000,Entire mucous membrane of nasal cavity and nasal sinus (body structure),Complete mucous membrane lining in nasal cavity and nasal sinuses,"This phrase conveys the complete mucous membrane lining ('complete') across two sites: nasal cavity and nasal (paranasal) sinuses, identifying a Body structure with full coverage. SCTID 736508000 is optimal because it represents the entire mucosa of both regions together. A broader parent concept without 'complete/entire' would be less specific, while child/sibling concepts focused on only one area would be insufficient. 'Nasal sinuses' equals paranasal sinuses in clinical parlance, and 'lining' is synonymous with mucous membrane/mucosa."
432745001,History of neuroblastoma (situation),Previous neuroblastoma noted,"The phrase 'previous neuroblastoma noted' signals past personal disease without details about current status, site, or stage. This fits the Situation with explicit context category. The precise match is History of neuroblastoma (situation) SCTID 432745001. Parent codes for general history of cancer are too broad, and Neuroblastoma (disorder) would misrepresent the temporal context as current. Family history and site-specific histories are not indicated by this wording."
278263002,L alphanumeric strain (qualifier value),L alphanumeric strain,"The entry names the strain designation as “L alphanumeric,” which directly corresponds to the SNOMED CT qualifier value for L alphanumeric strain. This is a Qualifier value category used to specify the alphanumeric strain class prefixed by “L,” without introducing organism type, number, severity, timing, or any other attribute. Using this exact phrase makes the concept 278263002 the most precise match. Broader parents like “Alphanumeric strain (qualifier value)” are too general because they do not specify the L series, and children or siblings (e.g., specific L1–Lx strains or other letter series) would be too specific or mismatched."
57880005,"Ascorbate 2,3-dioxygenase (substance)","Term recorded: ascorbate 2,3-dioxygenase","The phrase shows a recorded term, which is precisely the substance name and includes no additional attributes. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It maps directly to SCTID 57880005, whereas parent categories or sibling enzymes would be less accurate. The recording context does not alter the substance identity."
469193005,Intranasal cooling system control unit (physical object),Storage bin label — intranasal cooling system control unit,"Presented as a storage label, the entry identifies only the intranasal cooling system control unit and does not imply additional attributes. The concept is a Physical object in SNOMED CT. SCTID 469193005 exactly matches the specified control unit. Coding to a parent concept (the entire system) would be too broad, and selecting a sibling device component would be incorrect. The storage context does not modify the semantic target, which remains the control unit."
434627007,Genus Caminibacter (organism),Reference genus entry: Caminibacter,"As a reference entry, it names Caminibacter at genus rank, fitting the Organism category. The optimal SNOMED code is Genus Caminibacter (organism), SCTID 434627007. No species-level details are included, avoiding child concepts, and it is more specific than generic parent categories. The term is purely taxonomic and does not assert presence, pathology, or other attributes."
269790003,Mechanical asphyxia accident (event),Incident type: mechanical asphyxia accident,"This entry classifies the incident type as a mechanical asphyxia accident, maintaining the unintentional event framing. The SNOMED CT category is Event. It corresponds to SCTID 269790003 because it specifies the accidental mechanical asphyxia event without additional mechanism details. A generic incident type parent would be too nonspecific, and child mechanisms (e.g., compression accident) would add attributes not present. The wording is uniquely codable to the concept."
1193498001,Greenland (geographic location),Travel destination: Greenland,"The phrase names Greenland as a travel destination, but the coded entity remains the location Greenland itself. This falls under SNOMED CT Location — Geographic location and is best represented by SCTID 1193498001. The travel context does not introduce a different concept such as a procedure or event; it only references the place. No subregional qualifiers or related places are provided, so mapping to parents is too broad and to children/siblings would be incorrect."
765412006,Dyella marensis (organism),Dyella marensis species label,"The entry denotes a species label and names Dyella marensis, focusing on the organism’s taxonomic identity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact code SCTID 765412006 best fits the species. Parent genus or broader taxa are less specific, and sibling species would not match. No clinical state, detection, or other attributes are implied."
250811004,Minute volume (observable entity),Minute volume,"The entry states the exact preferred term for SCTID 250811004, representing the physiological measure of total ventilated air per minute. This is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT. No value, abnormality, device, or timing is added, so it maps precisely to the core concept of minute ventilation. Broader parents like general respiratory function are too vague, and siblings such as tidal volume or respiratory rate are different components rather than the per-minute volume. More specific children (e.g., inspired or expired minute volume) are not indicated, so the base observable is the most accurate match."
1240429002,Entire left bronchial vein (body structure),Anatomy of the left bronchial vein,"This phrasing still points to the named anatomical structure: the left bronchial vein. The semantic context (anatomy) does not change the underlying concept category, which remains a Body structure in SNOMED CT. It is specific to the left-sided bronchial vein and does not imply multiple veins, right-sided anatomy, or broader bronchial venous system anatomy. Therefore, 'Entire left bronchial vein' (1240429002) is the most precise mapping."
242536000,Exposure to man-made visible light (event),Pre-procedure checklist: exposure to artificial visible light,"Documented on a pre-procedure checklist, this still denotes exposure to artificial visible light, fitting SCTID 242536000. Category: Event. The context does not change the clinical nature of the exposure. The visible-spectrum restriction prevents mapping to non-visible radiation exposures, and no added attributes (e.g., intent or intensity) are included, making this the most precise code."
69521000119101,Long-term current use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy (situation),"Taking thyroid hormone replacement long-term, currently.","The entry explicitly states current use and long-term duration of thyroid hormone replacement therapy, mapping directly to the Situation concept Long-term current use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy (SCTID: 69521000119101). A parent like long-term use of medication is too broad, and child concepts naming specific agents would be overly narrow. No confounding attributes (indication, dose) are included, preserving precise code selection."
16788000,Naphthalene black 12B stain (substance),Chart note: naphthalene black 12B stain,"This mentions the substance within a chart note context but does not add any properties beyond the named stain. The category is Substance, and SCTID 16788000 corresponds to 'Naphthalene black 12B stain.' Parent concepts (generic stain) would be too broad, and sibling stains are distinct substances; therefore, the precise named code is appropriate."
261752006,Constant voltage (physical force),Constant voltage level,"This entry denotes that the voltage level is constant, focusing on the constancy attribute of the physical force without adding numeric values or device context. It is a Physical force (event) concept. The term 'level' remains within the meaning of voltage and does not introduce extent or severity. It is more specific than general Voltage and does not imply other properties or modes, making the constant voltage concept the best match."
694627531000119107,History of repair of congenital hernia of diaphragm (situation),Has had repair of congenital hernia of diaphragm,"The phrasing indicates the patient previously underwent repair for a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, clearly establishing a historical context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This aligns with history of repair of congenital hernia of diaphragm, as it emphasizes a past procedure for a congenital condition. It is not a current procedure, not aftercare, and not a general diaphragmatic hernia repair without the congenital attribute."
1352024000,Blood culture storage container (physical object),Laboratory blood culture storage container,"Adding 'laboratory' gives context without altering the identity of the physical object as a storage container for blood culture specimens. Category: Physical object. It maps to SCTID 1352024000 because the defining features—storage and blood culture—are present, with no subtype or media attributes. A parent concept would be too generic, and children such as specific blood culture bottles (e.g., aerobic) are unnecessarily narrow. The context term is acceptable and does not change the code selection."
223765006,Luzon (geographic location),"Address free text: ""Luzon""","Although presented as free-text from an address field, the only concept expressed is the place Luzon. In SNOMED CT this falls under Location (Geographic location), mapping precisely to SCTID 223765006. The surrounding context (address field) does not alter or add attributes to the location concept, nor does it point to a parent or child area."
1363356009,Presence of metastatic neoplasm in mesentery in excised tissue specimen (observable entity),Presence of metastatic disease in mesentery in excised tissue specimen,"The entry uses ‘metastatic disease’ as a clinically equivalent synonym for metastatic neoplasm, with the property of presence, the site as mesentery, and the specimen as excised tissue. This is an Observable entity. It does not state a positive/negative result. SCTID 1363356009 fits best due to specificity; broader parent concepts or sibling sites (e.g., peritoneum) would not match the mesentery focus. The synonym does not introduce new attributes or causes."
773979001,Prosthetic care plan (record artifact),Follow-up note: prosthetic care plan,"The entry signals that the follow-up note references the prosthetic care plan, but the core concept remains the prosthetic care plan artifact. The correct SNOMED CT concept is Prosthetic care plan (record artifact) [773979001], categorized as a Record artifact. Mention of follow-up is contextual and does not add attributes (e.g., status, phase) to the plan itself that would alter code selection or suggest a different hierarchy level."
57159002,Hospital-based outpatient respiratory disease clinic (environment),Appointment scheduled in the hospital-based outpatient respiratory disease clinic,"The entry identifies the appointment location as a hospital-based outpatient clinic devoted to respiratory diseases, reflecting the environment concept. Main concept: location/care setting. SNOMED CT category: Environment. SCTID 57159002 is exact due to its inclusion of hospital-based, outpatient, and respiratory specialty. Parent concepts and siblings that omit any of these qualifiers are less appropriate. No additional clinical attributes are conveyed."
297949006,Finding of moistness of skin (finding),Physical exam finding: moistness of skin.,"This entry explicitly labels moistness of skin as a physical exam finding, with no added attributes. It falls under Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 297949006 is the exact match because it encodes this specific moisture observation. Broader parent categories would lose precision, and sibling concepts that include sweating or temperature (diaphoresis, clammy skin) are not indicated here. The wording is directly equivalent to the preferred term."
223768008,Mindoro (geographic location),Mindoro — geographic site,"Here, Mindoro is labeled as a geographic site, which corresponds directly to the SNOMED CT Location hierarchy under Geographic location. The entry remains focused on the place name without additional attributes. SCTID 223768008 is the exact match. Choosing a broader parent would diminish specificity, and selecting children or siblings (e.g., provincial divisions) would misrepresent the general place reference stated."
433450000,Family history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (situation),Pre-op assessment: family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"The phrase includes non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the family history during a preoperative assessment, which still represents a situation rather than a patient diagnosis. SCTID 433450000 is the precise code. The setting does not alter the concept, and specifying NHL avoids mapping to a general lymphoma history or to Hodgkin lymphoma."
29549004,Ribosomal ribonucleic acid operon (finding),Microbiology note: ribosomal rRNA operon,"The main concept is the 'ribosomal rRNA operon.' The 'Microbiology note' prefix merely sets documentation context and does not add attributes such as abnormality, presence, or quantitative measures. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. SCTID 29549004 fits best since it captures the rRNA operon as a finding. Parent or sibling concepts (general operon, rRNA molecule, rRNA gene) would not be as precise. The synonym 'ribosomal rRNA operon' is clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
735950000,Swab of vascular catheter insertion site (specimen),Specimen: vascular catheter insertion site swab sample,"This indicates a specimen that is a swab sample with origin at the vascular catheter insertion site. The category is Specimen. The wording directly corresponds to SCTID 735950000, with no added attributes such as laterality, timing, or catheter subtype. Parent concepts lacking the specific source and sibling or child concepts with specialized catheter types are less appropriate here."
223886000,Kent (geographic location),Kent (England),"The entry indicates the place Kent and clarifies that it is the Kent located in England, corresponding exactly to Kent (geographic location) [223886000]. It does not introduce any clinical or temporal attributes; it is a pure geographic label. Category: Location (Geographic location). Specifying “England” prevents mapping to sibling concepts (e.g., Kent in Washington State) and remains more precise than the parent concept Geographic location. It does not imply a different administrative unit or a child concept."
419107003,Genus Tannerella (organism),"History list: Tannerella, taxonomic genus","The entry identifies Tannerella as a taxonomic genus in a history list and does not introduce detection, infection, or species-level attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. SCTID 419107003 Genus Tannerella (organism) is the precise match for a genus-level reference. Parent categories (e.g., broader bacterial groups) are too general, and child species concepts are more specific than stated. The phrase 'taxonomic genus' is a synonymous descriptor that preserves the intended rank."
328684000,Gluten-free white bread mix (product),Recipe calls for gluten-free white bread mix,"This statement indicates a recipe requires a product: a gluten-free mix used to make white bread. The most precise SNOMED CT mapping is Gluten-free white bread mix (product), SCTID 328684000. The category is Product. The entry contains no extraneous attributes. It would be incorrect to code as finished bread, flour, or a general gluten-free bread mix lacking the white bread specification, so this exact concept fits best."
223729001,Region of South Africa (geographic location),Regional area within South Africa,"The wording identifies a regional area located in South Africa and avoids specifying province, district, or named locality. The main concept is a geographic location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (environment). SCTID 223729001 'Region of South Africa (geographic location)' is appropriate because it represents any regional subdivision within the country. Parent concepts like the whole country are too broad, and sibling or child concepts such as provinces or cities would be too specific. 'Regional area' is a clinically safe paraphrase of 'region' without changing the code selection."
406707001,Trimorphodon biscutatus (organism),Snake: Trimorphodon biscutatus,"The entry labels the organism as a snake and specifies the species Trimorphodon biscutatus, keeping the focus on a single taxonomic entity. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Because the exact species is given, SCTID 406707001 is the correct code; parent concepts like Snake (organism) or Trimorphodon (genus) are broader and less precise, while sibling species would not match. The 'Snake:' descriptor is a general class label that does not create a different SNOMED concept."
130782000,Phthalyl amidase (substance),Phthalyl-amidase,"This is an orthographic variant using a hyphen but denotes the same enzyme substance. The concept is the named enzyme 'phthalyl amidase' and remains in the Substance category. The precise SNOMED CT match is Phthalyl amidase (substance), SCTID 130782000. A parent like 'amidase' would be too general, and any child isoforms or activity measurements would add attributes not present here. The hyphenation does not change the meaning or introduce new clinical attributes, so the same substance code applies."
22503007,Human leukocyte antigen Bw50 (substance),Transplant matching worksheet: HLA Bw50 antigen included,"The text references HLA Bw50 antigen as included in a matching worksheet, focusing on the antigen substance rather than any matching result. It aligns with the SNOMED CT Substance concept Human leukocyte antigen Bw50 (substance), SCTID 22503007. The entry does not imply presence, mismatch, or antibody detection, avoiding finding or procedure categories. Broader HLA antigen substances would be too general, and other Bw antigens would be inaccurate. The phrasing is a valid synonymic reference to the same antigen."
72110006,Below sea level (physical force),Travel destination below sea level,"This history-style statement identifies a destination at altitude below sea level, focusing on the physical force of negative elevation. Category: Physical force. It does not introduce timing, extent, or related conditions; the mention of 'travel' is contextual and does not change the environmental concept. Mapping to travel or exposure events would be less precise than coding the altitude state. It aligns with SCTID 72110006 and not with siblings like 'low altitude' or 'above sea level.'"
258921007,Micromole/gram hemoglobin (qualifier value),μmol/g of hemoglobin,"The entry provides a compact unit notation with an explicit denominator ('of hemoglobin'), clearly representing micromole per gram hemoglobin as a Qualifier value. The specification of hemoglobin distinguishes this unit from broader parents (e.g., μmol/g without substrate) and from siblings with other denominators. The phrase is a synonymous representation, preserving the unit semantics and not adding any attributes beyond the unit."
277093003,Fixed-movable bridge - dental (physical object),Fixed-movable bridge appliance present,"This notes the presence of a dental appliance specifically identified as a fixed-movable bridge, a Physical object. SCTID 277093003 is the precise match since the fixed-movable configuration is stated. The term “appliance” is general but coupled with “bridge” and “fixed-movable” keeps the concept specific. Parent concepts (generic bridge/appliance) and sibling bridge designs are less appropriate because they lack or differ from the fixed-movable feature."
215059003,"Motor vehicle nontraffic accident involving injury by being thrown against some part of, or object in motor vehicle, except off-road motor vehicle, while in motion, not on public highway (event)",Hurled into the B-pillar while a pickup truck was moving on a private driveway (nontraffic),"This describes the occupant being hurled (thrown) against a specific interior structure (B-pillar) while the pickup truck is in motion, in a nontraffic location (private driveway). It is a SNOMED CT Event and fits SCTID 215059003 exactly. Parent concepts are less specific, and siblings involving traffic roadway events or off-road vehicles are not appropriate. 'Hurled into' is equivalent to 'thrown against' in clinical context and does not change the code."
773595007,Pulmonary medicine care plan (record artifact),Pulmonary medicine care plan referenced in report,"The entry notes that a pulmonary medicine care plan is referenced in a report, emphasizing the existence of the care plan document without adding clinical details or status. The category is Record artifact. The correct SNOMED concept is Pulmonary medicine care plan (record artifact) [773595007]. A generic care plan artifact would be less specific, and condition-specific or therapy-focused plan artifacts would not match the specialty reference. The phrasing stays within the concept’s scope."
259077002,Millimeters of mercury/milliliter/second (qualifier value),Lab system unit: mmHg mL−1 s−1,"Using negative exponents, the entry denotes the same unit mmHg/mL/s in an alternative mathematical format. This is a Qualifier value in SNOMED CT and does not introduce measurements or clinical findings. SCTID 259077002 specifically codes millimeters of mercury per milliliter per second. Parent units (e.g., mmHg alone) or siblings with different volume or time bases would be incorrect. The exponent notation is a precise synonym of the same unit."
274216005,Horse rider accident (event),Horseback riding accident,"The entry conveys an accident occurring in the context of horseback riding, clearly implicating a mounted rider and not handlers or bystanders. It corresponds to the Event concept Horse rider accident (event), SCTID 274216005. There are no added attributes such as mechanism, timing, or injury severity. Using 'horseback' as a synonym of riding a horse does not alter the meaning; it remains rider-focused. More specific events like fall from horse are excluded, so this is the most precise match without drifting to parent or sibling concepts."
411184009,Benzalkonium chloride (in water) (product),Radiology intake note: benzalkonium chloride in water documented,"Even in a radiology intake context, the documented item is the product 'benzalkonium chloride in water,' which maps to SCTID 411184009. Main concept: product; the note does not introduce dose, route, indication, or concentration. SNOMED CT category: Product. Parent or sibling concepts that fail to specify water or indicate another vehicle would not match the wording. The context is administrative, but the concept referred remains the exact product."
11321000175108,Heart failure education declined (situation),Heart failure education not accepted.,"This phrase conveys that the patient did not accept education centered on heart failure. The concept is refusal of heart failure-specific education. It fits the Situation category in SNOMED CT. The exact code SCTID 11321000175108 is appropriate; a parent like “education not accepted” would be overly general, and siblings concerning other interventions would not match. “Not accepted” is synonymous with “declined/refused” in clinical documentation and does not change the concept."
4181000179103,Outpatient nursing report (record artifact),Refer to the outpatient nursing report,"The instruction to refer to the outpatient nursing report names the artifact explicitly and corresponds to Outpatient nursing report (record artifact). The main concept is the nursing-authored outpatient report; no additional attributes such as content, scope, or status are added. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It is more specific than the parent Nursing report because the outpatient setting is specified, and it does not imply alternative artifacts like notes or inpatient reports. The directive phrasing does not alter the coding."
217308005,Jump from burning tenement (event),Jumping from burning tenement,"The gerund form still denotes the event of jumping from a tenement that is burning, with no added details such as cause, injury, or location specifics. This is an Event, and 217308005 is the exact match. More general or different concepts (e.g., 'jumping from building,' 'tenement fire') do not capture both the jump and the tenement being on fire, so they are less appropriate."
4845002,Negative beta particle (physical force),Physical force: negative beta particle,"A field-style entry specifying the domain and the exact particle. Main concept: negative beta particle within the physical force domain. Category: Physical force. This targets 4845002 and avoids general beta particles or radiation phenomena. No attributes such as time, severity, or exposure are added; it’s a simple identification of the physical agent."
41588006,Light emitted from a tungsten light source (physical force),Tungsten light,"This concise phrase denotes light with the defining characteristic of originating from tungsten, which aligns with SCTID 41588006. The main concept remains the physical force of light; the term 'tungsten' indicates the source without adding attributes like intensity or timing. SNOMED CT category: Physical force. It is not a device concept (e.g., a tungsten lamp) and is more specific than the parent 'light' while not shifting to a sibling source such as fluorescent or daylight."
127470000,Tissue specimen from pancreas (specimen),Source: pancreas tissue specimen,"The entry conveys that the specimen is tissue and the anatomic source is the pancreas, with no method or subsite specified. It is a Specimen class concept in SNOMED CT, best matched by Tissue specimen from pancreas (SCTID 127470000). A parent notion like pancreas specimen would be too inclusive of non-tissue forms. Child/sibling concepts such as pancreatic biopsy specimen or fine needle aspirate add procedural technique that is absent here. The ""Source:"" labeling is contextual and does not alter the semantics; thus, it remains a direct synonym of the target concept."
246209001,Number of abscesses (observable entity),Recorded number of abscesses,"Adding ‘recorded’ indicates documentation status but does not alter the underlying observable: the count of abscesses. This fits SNOMED CT 246209001 as an Observable entity. It avoids implying presence, body site, or any value, and therefore is not better mapped to disorder or finding concepts like ‘abscess present’ or ‘multiple abscesses.’ The wording remains a semantically equivalent label for the measurement."
447264001,Valpar component work sample 17 pre-vocational readiness battery score (observable entity),"Valpar pre-vocational readiness battery, component work sample 17 score","This wording specifies the score for Component Work Sample 17 within the Valpar pre-vocational readiness battery, mapping directly to SCTID 447264001. The entry represents the score observable only, without results or interpretation. Category: Observable entity. It is specific to CWS-17 rather than the battery overall or another component, and it avoids child distinctions like raw versus converted scores. The phrasing is a clear synonym for the preferred term."
773709006,Structure of neck of left femur (body structure),Left femoral neck (structure),"By appending '(structure)', the entry clarifies that it refers to the anatomical entity, the left femoral neck. This is a Body structure (Anatomical structure). It matches SCTID 773709006, distinguishing the precise left femoral neck. Parent concepts like 'Femoral neck' without laterality are less precise, and siblings such as 'Right femoral neck' or 'Left femoral head' do not correspond. The parentheses do not alter meaning; they just reinforce the anatomical context without adding attributes."
223650003,Estonia (geographic location),The Republic of Estonia,"Adding the definite article does not change the referent; it still denotes the country as a geographic place. No attributes of nationality, residence, or events are conveyed. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The most precise match remains 223650003 | Estonia (geographic location) |. Broader parents (e.g., Europe) dilute specificity, while children (e.g., Tallinn) or siblings (e.g., Lithuania) misidentify the place. The phrasing is a standard synonym for the same country-level geographic location."
1306644000,Photographic extraoral image of 45 degree view of left half of face with lips relaxed and teeth in centric occlusion (record artifact),Diagnostic photo: extraoral 45-degree left facial view; lips relaxed; teeth in centric.,"This is a photographic extraoral artifact used diagnostically, with a 45° left facial view, lips relaxed, and teeth in centric occlusion. Category: Record artifact. It precisely fits 1306644000. A generic diagnostic photo would lack necessary specifications; right-side or smiling variants are sibling concepts. “Teeth in centric” is shorthand for centric occlusion and does not change the code."
1275629003,Surgical margin closest to primary malignant neoplasm of liver in excised specimen (observable entity),Cancer dataset entry: Nearest surgical margin to liver primary malignancy in excised specimen,"This dataset entry identifies the nearest surgical margin to the liver’s primary malignancy within an excised specimen. Category: Observable entity. It corresponds to SCTID 1275629003 because it specifies the closest margin and ties it to a primary malignant neoplasm of the liver, in the specimen context. Absent are measurements, margin positivity, or named margins that would map to different concepts. Synonyms such as “nearest” and “primary malignancy” are clinically equivalent."
223604001,Sri Lanka (geographic location),Facility documentation references Sri Lanka (country),"The documentation references the country Sri Lanka; the referent is the geographic location itself. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location hierarchy). SCTID 223604001 is the correct mapping. The wording does not claim facility location or care delivery there; it simply names the country. Broader parents or narrower children would not match the stated place, so the country-level location concept fits best."
731361005,Entire tributary of uterine vein (body structure),"Uterine vein tributary, as labeled in the report","The entry explicitly names a uterine vein tributary and indicates it was labeled, but the coded target is the anatomical structure. Category: Body structure. SCTID 731361005 precisely encodes the entire tributary of the uterine vein. The labeling context does not introduce attributes or actions; it avoids mapping to parent or sibling concepts such as the uterine vein or general uterine venous plexus."
447341000,Bile specimen obtained via biliary T-tube (specimen),Patient states bile was taken through her biliary T-tube,"Despite the patient-reported context, the clinical content is a bile specimen collected through a biliary T-tube, which maps to SNOMED CT 447341000 in the Specimen hierarchy. The phrasing does not introduce timing, indication, or other attributes, only the specimen and source. A parent bile specimen would lose the T-tube specificity, and siblings describing other drains would be mismatched, so this concept is the most precise."
122711004,Specimen from ovary obtained by removal of tumor in fragments (specimen),Ovary specimen comprising fragmented tumor tissue,"Here, the specimen is explicitly from the ovary and consists of fragmented tumor tissue, which indicates removal in pieces. This is a Specimen concept and matches SCTID 122711004. A more general ovary specimen concept would be imprecise because it could include non-tumor tissue or different collection methods. Sibling concepts such as excisional specimens taken en bloc or biopsy specimens would mischaracterize the acquisition. “Fragmented tumor tissue” is a synonymous description of “tumor in fragments” without adding attributes beyond those in the target concept."
727327005,Entire anatomical decussation (body structure),Patient education term: entire anatomical decussation,"In a patient education context, the entry still denotes the entire anatomical decussation as a structure, without implying any abnormality or other attributes. The category is Body structure. SCTID 727327005 precisely matches the whole decussation. Parent concepts are overly broad, and children naming specific decussations would introduce detail not present. The contextual label does not change the meaning or add attributes like disease, laterality, or function; it remains a synonymously stated reference to the entire anatomical decussation."
469630007,External defibrillator tester (physical object),Equipment list: external defibrillator tester,"This documentation-style entry identifies the physical object as an external defibrillator tester within an equipment list context. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The contextual label (“Equipment list”) does not alter the underlying concept, which maps precisely to SCTID 469630007. A more generic parent such as “Defibrillator tester” would miss the external specificity, and siblings focused on implantable devices or the defibrillator itself are excluded. No additional attributes are added beyond naming the device."
288564002,Review procedure (qualifier value),Procedure class code mapped to: Review,"This statement shows that the procedure’s class code maps to 'Review,' which reflects a qualifier value used for classification. It does not specify the object of review or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, making SCTID 288564002 the correct code. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., action-related 'Review' or specific review procedures) are less appropriate because the text denotes a class mapping, not an action or a detailed service description."
45367005,Tungsten radioisotope (substance),Radiotracer identified: tungsten radioisotope,"The phrase names the radiotracer as a tungsten radioisotope, which refers to the radioactive tungsten substance used as a tracer. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. 'Radiotracer' provides usage context but does not specify product formulation or dose; the core concept remains the substance identity. Parent 'radioisotope' would be too broad; child specific tungsten nuclides are not indicated. Sibling 'radiopharmaceutical' product concepts are not specified. SCTID 45367005 fits best."
115051001,Photobacterium histaminum (organism),Documentation lists the species Photobacterium histaminum,"This narrative notes that documentation lists Photobacterium histaminum as the species, with no attributes such as causality or infection. It should be coded to the Organism hierarchy. A parent organism code would be insufficiently specific, and a child strain would be unjustified. The paraphrase is clinically equivalent to naming the species, confirming 115051001 as the most precise match."
225734000,Holding room (environment),Holding room listed,"The entry lists the holding room, signifying the specific environment, which corresponds to SNOMED CT concept 225734000 (Environment). No attributes are added to imply function or timing, so it avoids sibling concepts such as Waiting room or Preoperative area. It is more precise than the parent Room (environment). Hence, Holding room (environment) is the appropriate code."
736396009,Interventional cardiology inpatient care plan (record artifact),Interventional cardiology inpatient care plan,"The entry names a care plan specifically for interventional cardiology and explicitly in the inpatient setting, which directly aligns with SNOMED CT concept 736396009. The main concept is a record artifact: a care plan. Attributes stated are the clinical specialty (interventional cardiology) and the care setting (inpatient). The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This is the most precise match because it captures both the specialty and the inpatient context. A generic parent like Care plan (record artifact) lacks the specialty and setting, and siblings such as Interventional cardiology outpatient care plan or broader Cardiology inpatient care plan would be less accurate. No additional attributes (e.g., procedure details, timing beyond inpatient, severity) are introduced."
223528007,Somalia (geographic location),Somalia (national jurisdiction),"Describing Somalia as a national jurisdiction still denotes the sovereign country. The main concept is the country Somalia. Category: Geographic location. It matches SCTID 223528007, not a regional parent or child administrative division. 'National jurisdiction' is a synonymous descriptor for a country and does not change the location being coded."
1365863000,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror of maxilla with mouth open (record artifact),"Intraoral photo of upper jaw via mirror, mouth open.","The entry describes a photo captured inside the mouth, using a mirror, of the upper jaw, with the mouth open. The main concepts mirror those in the target: photographic intraoral image, mirror view, maxilla (upper jaw as a clinically equivalent synonym), and mouth open. It is a Record artifact, not a finding or procedure. SCTID 1365863000 is the most specific code because it encodes a mirror-view intraoral photograph of the maxilla with mouth open. Parent artifacts lacking the mirror or region are too broad; siblings focused on the mandible, mouth closed, or non-mirror views are not appropriate. The synonym “upper jaw” is clinically equivalent to maxilla and does not change the code selection."
445104009,Allred score for neoplasm (observable entity),Allred score applicable to neoplasm,"This phrasing states that the Allred score pertains to a neoplasm, clearly referencing the score as an observable without providing values or receptor details. Main concept: Allred score tied to tumor context. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 445104009 is the most precise match since it defines the Allred score for neoplasm; broader observables or different scores (H-score/IRS) are not indicated, and receptor-specific Allred scores would be overly narrow. The wording remains equivalent to the preferred term."
763321009,Mental health care program approach crisis plan (record artifact),Program approach crisis plan for mental health care,"This phrasing conveys a crisis plan defined by the mental health care program approach, maintaining the document artifact nature. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It matches SCTID 763321009 by explicitly referencing both crisis plan and mental health program approach. A generic program document or non-crisis care plan would be less accurate. The wording is a clinically safe synonym, not adding severity, timing, or cause."
429931008,Computed tomography of kidney with contrast (procedure),CT kidney with contrast,"Main concept: computed tomography focused on the kidney with administration of contrast material. Attributes explicitly present are imaging modality (CT), anatomic site (kidney), and use of contrast. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. This exactly corresponds to 'Computed tomography of kidney with contrast' (429931008); it is more precise than the parent concept 'CT of kidney' without contrast specification and excludes the sibling 'CT of kidney without contrast' due to the explicit 'with contrast'. The phrasing is a direct synonym and does not introduce timing, laterality, indication, or protocol details."
782766000,Strip graft of skin (substance),Pathology label (material description): strip graft of skin,"A material description for labeling identifies the item as a strip graft of skin, which refers to the tissue graft substance in strip form. No procedural action, donor type, or thickness is specified. This is a Substance concept, and the exact code is Strip graft of skin (substance) SCTID 782766000. The strip configuration differentiates it from parent or sibling substances and does not introduce attributes beyond the concept."
408406000,Patient held cardiac record issued (record artifact),Patient given a cardiac record to keep,"This patient-centered phrasing describes issuance of a cardiac record intended for the patient to keep, i.e., a patient-held cardiac record, without adding further attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. SCTID 408406000 is the best code because it captures the issuance of a patient-held record specific to the cardiac domain. Using broader parent codes would lose the cardiac specificity, and sibling codes for non-cardiac or different artifacts would be less precise. “Given to keep” is a plain-language synonym of “issued patient-held record,” maintaining equivalence."
223862002,Regions of England (geographic location),Results stratified by England's regions.,"“England’s regions” identifies the set of regions within England, synonymous with the preferred term. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). Stratification is contextual; the codable location concept is SCTID 223862002. It does not specify any one region or other geographic unit, excluding parent or child/sibling concepts."
129274004,Discharge - action (qualifier value),Documented action: discharge,"This entry captures that the recorded action is “discharge,” which corresponds to the action qualifier Discharge - action (129274004) in the Qualifier value hierarchy. The documentation context does not add clinical attributes or imply a completed patient discharge procedure. Therefore, it is more precise than the generic parent Action (qualifier value) and does not map to sibling actions."
398193008,Premedication prescribed (situation),Premedication Rx provided.,"'Rx' is a standard shorthand for prescription; 'provided' indicates issuance. The entry conveys that a premedication prescription exists, matching the Situation 'Premedication prescribed' (398193008). It does not claim administration or planning, so child/sibling concepts like 'premedication given' or 'premedication planned' would be less accurate. It is more specific than a general 'Rx provided' because it specifies premedication, without adding any extra attributes."
37550003,Hospital-based outpatient dermatology clinic (environment),Dermatology clinic — hospital outpatient setting,"This entry conveys a dermatology clinic specifically in a hospital outpatient setting, which matches the defined environment. Category: Environment or geographical location (environment). It corresponds to 37550003 by combining specialty (dermatology) with hospital-based outpatient status. More generic parents (e.g., dermatology clinic without specifying hospital outpatient) are less precise, and inpatient or non–hospital-based outpatient clinics (siblings) are excluded by the explicit setting."
216098004,"Hit by object falling from unpowered aircraft, occupant of unpowered aircraft injured (event)","Accident mechanism: Falling object from an unpowered aircraft struck an occupant of an unpowered aircraft, with injury.","The mechanism description identifies the falling object source (unpowered aircraft) and the injured party’s role (occupant of an unpowered aircraft), which matches SNOMED CT 216098004. Category: Event. Parent categories lack either the unpowered specificity or occupant role. Sibling concepts like ground victim scenarios are excluded by the wording. Synonymous phrasing remains clinically equivalent and does not alter code assignment."
429750003,Left ventricular wall motion abnormality (finding),LV wall motion abnormality,"This entry conveys an abnormality of wall motion in the left ventricle using the common clinical abbreviation “LV.” It remains a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 429750003 is the precise concept because the location (left ventricle) and the nature of the finding (wall motion abnormality) are clearly indicated without subtype or cause. Parent concepts referring to ventricular or cardiac wall motion abnormalities are broader, and child concepts like LV hypokinesia or segmental defects add detail not present. The abbreviation does not alter meaning; it is a clinically equivalent synonym to the preferred term."
126321000146108,Usually able to care for child (finding),"Patient states, ""I can usually take care of my child.""",A patient-reported quotation expressing typical ability to care for a child; “take care of” is a common synonym for “care for.” This is a Clinical finding and aligns with “Usually able to care for child (finding).” The quote adds no extra attributes beyond the usual capacity. A general ability code without the ‘usually’ nuance or any inability-related code would not be as accurate.
214550004,"Noncollision motor vehicle traffic accident involving jump from motor vehicle while in motion, passenger of motor vehicle injured (event)",Occupant role: passenger; mechanism: jump from moving motor vehicle; injury; noncollision traffic accident.,"The entry enumerates occupant role (passenger), mechanism (jump from moving motor vehicle), injury, and noncollision traffic accident context, matching the target concept. SNOMED CT code 214550004 is an Event that encapsulates these attributes. Using a parent concept would lose specificity, and sibling concepts (e.g., driver injured, collision) would not match. The structured phrasing uses synonyms consistent with the concept without introducing additional attributes."
304164004,Wrist joint approach (qualifier value),Access route: wrist joint,"The entry explicitly defines the access route as the wrist joint, which maps to the SNOMED CT qualifier Wrist joint approach (304164004). Category: Qualifier value. 'Access route' is a common synonym in procedural documentation for 'approach' and does not alter the concept, technique, or add laterality. It excludes broader regional approaches and avoids specific directional variants like dorsal or volar wrist approaches, keeping it at the exact level of the wrist joint. No additional procedural details are provided, ensuring the entry uniquely represents the approach qualifier."
1259953000,Entire cavity of left cardiac ventricle (body structure),Whole left ventricular lumen,"The entry specifies the whole (i.e., entire) lumen of the left ventricle, which is the cavity space. The main concept is anatomical, a Body structure, matching SNOMED CT 1259953000 for the entire cavity of the LV. A parent concept lacking the fullness qualifier would be less specific, and sibling concepts referring to myocardial tissue or sub-sections would be off-target. The use of “lumen” is a safe synonymous term for cavity and does not introduce new attributes."
1208605003,Estimated quantity of intake of energy (observable entity),Nutrition assessment: estimated energy intake,"This documentation-style entry records an estimated amount of dietary energy consumed within a nutrition assessment, corresponding to the observable entity of estimated energy intake. The context (assessment) does not alter the concept's attributes; it remains an estimate of quantity. Parent or sibling concepts (measured intake, energy needs) are not indicated, supporting the chosen code."
388317002,Mouse serum proteins specific immunoglobulin E (substance),Targeted antibody: mouse serum proteins-specific IgE,"This phrasing identifies the targeted antibody as IgE specific to mouse serum proteins, with no testing outcomes or clinical assertion. The concept belongs to the Substance hierarchy, and “Mouse serum proteins specific immunoglobulin E” (388317002) is the exact match. ‘Targeted antibody’ is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of allergen-specific IgE. Broader parent IgE concepts or mouse allergen siblings (epithelium, urine) are excluded by the explicit ‘serum proteins’ specificity."
117003005,"Serotonin induced platelet aggregation, function (observable entity)",Platelet aggregation reactivity to serotonin,"The term 'reactivity' here refers to the functional aggregation response of platelets to serotonin, exactly matching the observable entity Serotonin induced platelet aggregation, function (117003005). It is an observable, not a procedure or a diagnostic finding with a result. It is more specific than general platelet aggregation function (parent) and excludes siblings tied to ADP, epinephrine, collagen, etc. No additional attributes like rate, lag, or amplitude are mentioned, so it stays at the correct level of specificity."
151031000119109,Rubella vaccination given (situation),Clinic administered rubella vaccine.,"This confirms the clinic administered the rubella vaccine, meaning the vaccination was given. It fits into the Situation with explicit context category. Rubella vaccination given (situation) is most accurate because it captures the completed rubella vaccination without extra attributes like route, dose, or timing. Procedure codes emphasize the act rather than the status; generic parents and different status or antigen siblings are less precise."
76772003,Gamma radiation (physical force),Problem list item: gamma radiation,"Even as a problem list entry, the phrase names only the agent and does not assert exposure or injury. The correct SNOMED CT category is Physical force, with the best match Gamma radiation (physical force) [76772003]. Selecting parent concepts like Ionizing radiation would lose specificity, and related entities such as radiation dose or therapeutic procedures are not implied."
449196006,Genus Eremophila (organism),Patient-reported term: Eremophila (genus),"A patient-reported label still denotes the organism’s genus Eremophila without adding attributes like symptoms or causation. This matches SNOMED CT 449196006 Genus Eremophila (organism), categorized as an Organism concept. The explicit genus rank avoids mapping to broader parents or narrower child species, and does not invoke sibling genera. The synonymic presentation is semantically equivalent to the preferred term."
62480006,Psychiatric hospital (environment),Behavioral health hospital,"Main concept: hospital environment specialized in behavioral/psychiatric health. No additional qualifiers are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. “Behavioral health hospital” is commonly used as a synonym for psychiatric hospital and does not change the scope of the setting, so SCTID 62480006 is the most precise match. A psychiatric unit/ward would be a subset within a hospital and thus too narrow, while generic Hospital (environment) is too broad."
250430006,Color of specimen (observable entity),Specimen color (observed),"The phrase indicates that the observable entity being considered is the specimen’s color, emphasizing assessment without providing a particular outcome. This maps directly to Color of specimen (Observable entity, 250430006). Parent concepts such as general specimen characteristics are too broad, and child or sibling notions like specific-color findings or color of a particular specimen type (urine, stool, blood) add details not present here."
28829009,Coal tar naphtha (substance),Coal tar naphtha,"The entry directly names the substance coal tar naphtha, which is the precise SNOMED CT concept requested. No additional attributes (such as route, concentration, exposure, or clinical effect) are present. The correct SNOMED category is Substance. Choosing the specific substance concept is more accurate than a parent like Naphtha (substance) or a sibling such as petroleum naphtha because the coal tar origin is explicitly referenced, matching Coal tar naphtha and not a broader or different source-derived form."
224710001,Upstairs (environment),Upstairs location,"The phrase identifies a location and specifies it as 'Upstairs,' which is an environmental descriptor. This is best coded to Upstairs (environment), SCTID 224710001, under Environment or geographical location. It does not introduce additional context such as building type, unit, or activity. More general parents would lose specificity, while siblings like Stairwell, Landing, or Downstairs are not supported by the wording. 'Location' here is a documentation label and does not alter the concept."
417704008,Membranous articular strain (finding),Membranous articular strain noted,"The entry records that a membranous articular strain is noted, not adding any qualifiers beyond the core concept. It aligns with SNOMED CT 417704008 (Clinical finding). Broader parents such as unspecified articular strain are less precise, and siblings like sprain or inflammatory diagnoses are inconsistent with the phrase. The documentation verb “noted” is contextual and does not affect the core concept mapping."
425789000,Transluminal intracardiac echocardiography (procedure),Transvascular intracardiac echocardiography,"This phrase denotes intracardiac echocardiography performed via transvascular (i.e., transluminal) access. It is a Procedure and aligns with SCTID 425789000. The explicit transvascular approach provides specificity beyond the parent concept, and the intracardiac site differentiates it from transesophageal or transthoracic procedures. 'Transvascular' is clinically equivalent to transluminal without modifying the core meaning or adding extra attributes."
258613004,Living specimen (specimen),Live sample specimen,"“Live sample specimen” conveys a specimen that is alive, equivalent to “living specimen.” It falls within the Specimen hierarchy, with Living specimen (specimen) [258613004] as the most specific match. The entry refrains from stating tissue type, organism, or preservation, avoiding misclassification to child/sibling concepts. The generic parent Specimen lacks the living attribute and is less precise. The synonym does not introduce new clinical attributes."
467933000,Catheter-tip-to-tissue contact monitor (physical object),Catheter tip tissue contact monitor attached,"The entry notes an attachment status while naming the exact monitor, introducing no added attributes such as method or site beyond tissue contact. Category: Physical object. SCTID 467933000 matches best because it identifies the catheter-tip-to-tissue contact monitor. Parent monitors are too general, and concepts implying measurement specifics (e.g., force) are not stated. The phrasing remains a clinically equivalent synonym for the same device."
65001000119101,Family history of connective tissue disorder (situation),Orthopedic clinic history lists family history of a connective tissue disorder.,"This statement records that the orthopedic clinic history includes family history of a connective tissue disorder, and it does not specify type of disorder or relative. The central concept is family history of connective tissue disorder. It is a Situation with explicit context and maps to Family history of connective tissue disorder (SCTID: 65001000119101). More general parent concepts would be insufficiently specific, and child/sibling concepts naming a particular disorder would be inappropriate. The clinic context is not an attribute that changes the code."
71475001,Echinorhynchus leidyi (organism),Identified species—Echinorhynchus leidyi,"The statement presents the species identification without implying disease or detection status beyond naming the organism. SNOMED CT category: Organism. SCTID 71475001 is appropriate as it represents the species itself. Parent (genus) or sibling species codes would be less precise, and finding/procedure concepts are not indicated because no test outcome semantics beyond naming the species are included."
102429003,"Exposure to polluted water, non-occupational (event)",Triage note: non-occupational contaminated water exposure,"This triage documentation records an exposure event to contaminated water and specifies non-occupational context. Category: Event. 'Contaminated' is equivalent to 'polluted' here, without adding attributes. The note avoids route-specific detail, keeping it general. The non-occupational qualifier makes SCTID 102429003 the most accurate code, avoiding broader parents and occupational siblings."
260310006,2 fingers (qualifier value),Follow-up entry: two fingers,The follow-up context does not introduce clinical attributes such as laterality or severity; it simply records that the quantity is two fingers. This belongs to the Qualifier value category and matches 2 fingers (qualifier value) [260310006]. Parent or sibling concepts (different counts or anatomical entities) would be less precise.
213806001,"Train collision with fallen tree, pedal cyclist injured (event)",Pedal cyclist casualty from train collision with a fallen tree,"It identifies a pedal cyclist as the casualty resulting from a train collision with a fallen tree, directly corresponding to the Event concept 'Train collision with fallen tree, pedal cyclist injured'. No extra attributes are included. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts with different injured parties or collision objects would not match the stated scenario. The synonyms used are clinically safe and maintain code equivalence."
228961005,Small slices/day (qualifier value),Telehealth check-in notes small slices/day,"This entry documents the qualifier value 'small slices per day' during a telehealth visit. No count, item, or timing beyond daily is introduced. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. SCTID 228961005 is the precise match, as it encodes 'Small slices/day'. Using a broader parent or a different-size sibling would alter the intended value. The note-taking context does not change coding."
312808006,Entire arch of second lumbar vertebra (body structure),Anatomy note: arch of the second lumbar vertebra,"This narrative-style entry identifies the arch of the second lumbar vertebra as the anatomical subject, with no added clinical attributes. It is a Body structure and directly matches 'Entire arch of second lumbar vertebra' (SCTID 312808006). Broader parents such as 'arch of lumbar vertebra' or 'vertebral arch' lack specificity to L2. Children like 'lamina of second lumbar vertebra' or 'pedicle of second lumbar vertebra' would represent subcomponents. Sibling concepts at other vertebral levels do not match. The 'Anatomy note' prefix is contextual and does not modify the anatomical meaning of the entry."
27732004,High frequency (qualifier value),High frequency on follow-up,"The entry states the qualitative classification as high, with the context that this is observed on follow-up. The main concept is the high frequency qualifier, categorized by SNOMED CT as a Qualifier value. The follow-up context does not modify the qualifier into a timing attribute of the concept itself; it merely indicates when it was documented. No cause, severity, laterality, extent, or associated conditions are mentioned. SCTID 27732004 is the precise match. Parent frequency qualifiers would be too broad, and sibling categories (low, moderate) would not align. No numeric measurement or domain-specific frequency is implied, keeping the entry uniquely codable to the high frequency qualifier value."
56393004,"Immunologic reaction, function (observable entity)",Immunologic reaction functional parameter,"Describing it as a 'functional parameter' preserves the observable nature of the concept and emphasizes that the object is a measurable property of the immune reaction. No type, severity, or outcome is included. This fits the Observable entity category and aligns with SCTID 56393004. Broader observables would omit the reaction-specific focus, while any child specifying a particular response subtype is not indicated, confirming this concept as the precise match."
22328000,Reconstruction of subcutaneous tissue without skin graft (procedure),Subcutaneous tissue reconstruction done without skin graft,"This entry indicates that reconstruction of subcutaneous tissue was done, with explicit exclusion of a skin graft. The category is Procedure. It corresponds to SCTID 22328000 by combining the correct site (subcutaneous tissue) with the 'without skin graft' qualifier. Broader reconstruction codes or those involving graft use would be less accurate. The wording is a direct paraphrase that maintains the same coding intent."
399657004,Tissue specimen from trophoblast (specimen),Trophoblast tissue collected (specimen),"The entry states that a specimen consisting of trophoblast tissue was collected, emphasizing the tissue source. The main concept is a tissue specimen from trophoblast, and no further attributes are added. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 399657004 is the appropriate code because it directly represents trophoblast-derived tissue specimens. Broader or alternative anatomical specimens are not referenced, preventing misclassification to parent or sibling concepts."
277381004,Stroke index (observable entity),Stroke index parameter,"Referring to stroke index as a parameter still points to the same observable entity and not to a procedure or result interpretation. It cleanly maps to Stroke index (277381004). Parent classes like ‘cardiac measurement’ are overly broad, while siblings (cardiac index, stroke volume, shock index) would misrepresent what is specified here, which is the stroke index itself."
720787007,Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1A serotype O:14 (organism),Historical organism entry: Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1A serotype O:14,"The term 'Historical organism entry' is contextual metadata; the core content is the organism named with biotype 1A and serotype O:14, which matches SNOMED CT 720787007 (Organism). No additional attributes such as disease state or method are introduced. Using a more general or partially specified organism concept would fail to reflect the full subtype detail content present."
257696008,Rural road (environment),Rural road locale,"Rural road locale indicates a locale that is a rural road, mapping directly to Rural road (environment), SCTID 257696008, in the Environment hierarchy. The term locale is contextual and does not add attributes beyond the environmental designation. A broader parent like Road (environment) would be too general, and siblings like Urban road would be inaccurate since rural, not urban, is specified. No child concept such as unpaved rural road or country lane is implied by the wording. Therefore, Rural road is the most precise code."
411754008,Phaseolus vulgaris (white) diagnostic allergen extract (product),Used reagent: Phaseolus vulgaris (white) diagnostic allergen extract in testing,"This entry indicates the reagent used in testing was the Phaseolus vulgaris (white) diagnostic allergen extract, keeping the focus on the product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. It accurately maps to SCTID 411754008 by naming the diagnostic allergen extract and its white Phaseolus vulgaris source without introducing procedure codes or test outcomes. Parent concepts lacking the white variety would be less precise, while siblings for other allergen sources or therapeutic preparations would be incorrect. The mention of 'used in testing' is context and does not change the product code."
391092009,History of fragility fracture (situation),Prior fragility fracture (patient history),"The entry explicitly states a prior fragility fracture within the patient history context, confirming it is not a current event. The concept is a historical fragility fracture. SNOMED CT category: Situation with explicit context. History of fragility fracture (391092009) is the precise code, as it encodes the past status and fragility characteristics. Parent or sibling concepts describing general history of fracture or active fractures would be less accurate."
598081000005100,Stopped smoking after first trimester (finding),Delivery note: smoking was stopped after first trimester,"This delivery documentation states that smoking cessation occurred after the first trimester. The core concept is cessation of tobacco smoking; the attribute is the timing after first trimester. Category: Clinical finding. The most precise code is SNOMED CT 598081000005100. Parent concepts like “Stopped smoking” lack the pregnancy-related timing, and sibling concepts with different trimester timing would misrepresent the statement, which clearly indicates post–first trimester cessation."
361960003,Entire bronchus of left upper lobe (body structure),Target: left upper lobe bronchus,"‘Target’ here denotes the anatomical structure of interest—the left upper lobe bronchus. As a Body structure, this maps to SCTID 361960003. It does not generalize to the parent left lung bronchus nor specify a segmental child. The contextual word ‘Target’ adds no clinical attributes (e.g., disease or procedure) and preserves exact anatomical identification."
703513008,Oryzanol (product),Supplement name: Oryzanol,"The entry lists the product name 'Oryzanol' in a supplement context, without specifying dose or form. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Oryzanol (product) SCTID 703513008 is the exact match for a named supplement product. Parent supplement/product classes are too generic, and child concepts (form/strength) are not indicated. Substance-only or sibling product codes would not reflect the named supplement product."
223801007,Laois (geographic location),"Laois, Ireland","This denotes the county of Laois and adds national context without changing the specific location being identified. The concept remains Laois (geographic location), SCTID 223801007, under the Location hierarchy. Mentioning 'Ireland' does not redirect coding to the parent country or introduce another attribute; it merely situates Laois geographically, keeping 223801007 as the most accurate code."
223578009,Turkmenistan (geographic location),Place: Turkmenistan,"This states a place name and identifies Turkmenistan, a sovereign country, without extra context that would require a different concept type. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The precise match is Turkmenistan, SCTID 223578009. Using a parent concept like 'place' or 'country' would be nonspecific, while child or sibling entities (cities, administrative regions, or other countries) would not fit. No attributes like residence or travel are added, keeping the mapping uniquely to 223578009."
58721000,Limonite (substance),Limonite iron ore,"This entry identifies limonite and clarifies it as an iron ore, but the core material remains limonite. The SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the exact code is Limonite (substance) SCTID 58721000. Using 'iron ore' is a descriptive modifier and does not shift to a broader or different concept. Parent categories like iron oxides or iron ore (general) would be too broad; siblings like hematite or magnetite represent other specific ores and are not intended here."
359703006,Total glossectomy (procedure),Pathology specimen labeled: total glossectomy,"The specimen labeling reflects the procedure performed—total glossectomy—i.e., complete tongue excision, a surgical Procedure. The correct SNOMED CT code is 359703006. Although it appears in a pathology context, it does not introduce a different attribute or concept like specimen type; it names the procedure. Broader glossectomy and partial variants are less accurate than the explicit total designation."
289075000,Structure of gluteus minimus muscle trochanteric bursa (body structure),Greater trochanter region: gluteus minimus trochanteric bursa,"This entry sets the regional context (greater trochanter) and explicitly identifies the specific bursa associated with the gluteus minimus, with no pathological or procedural detail added. The SNOMED CT category is Body structure, and SCTID 289075000 fits exactly. A broader parent like “greater trochanteric bursa” would be ambiguous because multiple bursae exist; specifying gluteus minimus avoids mapping to a parent. The phrasing remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
15647781000119101,History of villous adenoma of duodenum (situation),Medical history: villous adenoma of the duodenum,"The phrase “Medical history” clearly sets a historical context for the condition, which is villous adenoma localized in the duodenum. This fits the Situation with explicit context category. It precisely maps to SCTID 15647781000119101 and is more specific than parents like history of duodenal neoplasm or history of adenoma of duodenum without histologic type. It also avoids sibling concepts like family history or current villous adenoma. No procedural or severity attributes are included in the wording."
446846006,Urine specimen obtained via indwelling urinary catheter (specimen),Lab label: urine—indwelling urinary catheter specimen,"The label indicates a urine specimen and explicitly notes it as an indwelling urinary catheter specimen. This belongs to the Specimen category and fits SCTID 446846006 precisely, as the collection method is the key distinguishing attribute. Parent terms like “urine specimen” are too broad, and siblings indicating different collection methods (clean-catch, straight catheter) would contradict the indwelling specification. The phrasing introduces no additional attributes, keeping the code selection exact."
242098008,Motor vehicle on road in collision with building (event),Radiology clinical info: mechanism — motor vehicle on road collision with building,"The clinical info states the mechanism: motor vehicle, on road, collision with building. This is an Event. SCTID 242098008 aligns exactly with the mechanism described. Using a general accident code would omit the building detail, and specifying different fixed objects would miscode the event. The entry provides no additional attributes such as injuries, focusing only on the event, which is appropriate."
1373536006,Fallopian tube occlusion insert introducer (physical object),Fallopian tube occlusion insert delivery introducer,"The main concept is still the introducer for delivering a fallopian tube occlusion insert; ""delivery"" clarifies purpose without altering the device class. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. The precise code is Fallopian tube occlusion insert introducer [1373536006]. A generic delivery system or introducer would be a less specific parent, and the occlusion insert (implant) or other tubal occlusion equipment are different sibling concepts."
285831008,Gas pressure - physical agent (physical force),Gaseous pressure,"“Gaseous pressure” is a clinically safe synonym for gas pressure and conveys the same physical force of a gas, aligning with Gas pressure - physical agent (physical force) [285831008]. The concept category is Physical force under Physical agent. It avoids introducing attributes like high/low pressure or specifying the gas type (e.g., air), so narrower child concepts are not a better fit, and broader parents would be insufficiently specific."
1546551000004107,Presence of primary malignant neoplasm of prostate at surgical margin in prostatectomy specimen (observable entity),Diagnostic report: presence of primary prostate malignancy identified at the surgical margin.,"This diagnostic statement directly asserts presence of primary prostate malignancy at the surgical margin, in the context of a prostatectomy specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity. It matches SCTID 1546551000004107 by explicitly naming presence, primary malignant neoplasm of prostate, and surgical margin within specimen evaluation. Broader margin presence observables lacking the prostate specificity would be less precise, and child concepts with specified margin sites or detailed involvement are not referenced. The phrasing is a clear synonym and keeps the code selection unchanged."
736352009,Cardiac surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Plan of care for inpatient heart surgery,"This is a synonymical phrasing using 'heart surgery' for 'cardiac surgery' and 'plan of care' for 'care plan,' maintaining inpatient context. Category: Record artifact. The lay synonym 'heart surgery' is clinically equivalent to 'cardiac surgery' and does not change scope. The most accurate mapping is 736352009; broader inpatient care plans or different settings/artifact types would not match the stated content."
61466002,Uridine nucleosidase (substance),Uridine nucleosidase substance,"The entry states the name and explicitly labels it as a substance, which aligns with the SNOMED CT modeling of “Uridine nucleosidase (substance)” under the Substance category. There are no added attributes such as dose, source, activity, or abnormality. SCTID 61466002 is preferred because it is the exact substance concept. More general parents like “Biochemical substance” or “Enzyme” would be less specific, and sibling/child variants (e.g., isoforms or other uridine-metabolizing enzymes) are not indicated by the wording. The phrase remains clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
418110001,Fluoroscopic angiography of bronchial artery with contrast (procedure),"Bronchial arteriogram (fluoroscopy, contrast)","This concise entry represents a procedure: an arteriogram of the bronchial artery performed with fluoroscopy and contrast. Attributes are site (bronchial artery), method (fluoroscopy), and use of contrast. SNOMED CT category is Procedure. “Arteriogram” and “angiogram” are clinically equivalent terms. More general angiography without specifying fluoroscopy or contrast would map to a parent, and modalities like CT/MR or therapeutic actions like embolization are not implied, making SCTID 418110001 the most accurate code."
182827006,Prescription issued for patient on vacation (situation),Pharmacy record: prescription issued for a patient on vacation.,"From a pharmacy perspective, this confirms a prescription was issued for a patient on vacation, directly matching the Situation SCTID 182827006. The phrasing does not suggest refill, early supply, or specific travel medications. Parent concepts without the vacation attribute are too broad. There are no added attributes like dose, quantity, or destination."
397134003,Specimen from vulva obtained by radical vulvectomy (specimen),Operative note: vulvar specimen removed in radical vulvectomy.,"This operative context confirms a specimen from the vulva and that it was removed in the course of a radical vulvectomy, which matches SCTID 397134003 within the Specimen hierarchy. It states neither diagnosis nor laterality, and it avoids alternative techniques, making parent or sibling mappings inappropriate. The phrasing is clinically equivalent and directly captures source plus method."
473089008,History of recent air travel (situation),Chart note: recent air travel history,"The phrase clearly documents recent air travel within the chart's history section, matching the concept. It remains a Situation. SCTID 473089008 should be used because it captures the specific historical circumstance. Parent concepts such as 'History of travel' are too broad, and sibling concepts like 'History of recent sea travel' are different modalities. The wording is semantically equivalent and adds no extra attributes beyond those in the preferred term."
42630001,Procedure code not assigned (finding),Procedure code not captured.,"The entry means the procedure code was not captured/assigned in documentation, which is a Clinical finding. SNOMED CT 42630001 is the correct precise concept. It refers specifically to procedure codes, not diagnosis codes, and does not specify systems that would push toward child concepts. 'Not captured' is a recognized synonym for non-assignment without adding causation."
773508000,Interventional radiology care plan (record artifact),IR clinical care plan,"IR (interventional radiology) plus 'clinical care plan' conveys a recorded plan of care specific to IR. The main concept is the care plan artifact; no extra attributes are present. Category: Record artifact. The precise code is 'Interventional radiology care plan (record artifact)' SCTID 773508000. A broad care plan parent would be less exact, and related concepts like procedural plans or protocols are not appropriate. The abbreviation and synonym are clinically equivalent."
422432008,Family history section (record artifact),Family history subsection,"This describes a subsection devoted to family history within a larger document, still a structural artifact. In SNOMED CT, this is a Record artifact and matches Family history section (record artifact) because the subsection is functionally the family history section within a note. Parent concepts like general subsection or section are too generic; siblings like Social history subsection are different topical areas. No attributes such as diagnoses or relatives are added, maintaining precise mapping."
175218000,Transluminal closure of ductus arteriosus with prosthesis (procedure),Transcatheter PDA occlusion using prosthetic device,"This conveys transcatheter (transluminal) occlusion of PDA with a prosthetic device, i.e., device closure. The main concept is Procedure-based closure with prosthesis. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. SCTID 175218000 fits exactly; broader PDA closure codes don't include approach/device, and device-specific children are more narrow. 'Occlusion' and 'closure' are interchangeable in PDA procedures, and 'prosthetic device' equals 'prosthesis' in this context."
415540007,Soccer field (environment),Soccer pitch,"The term refers to the playing field used for soccer and is a standard synonym in British English, which is clinically equivalent to soccer field. It represents an environment/location and aligns with SNOMED CT Soccer field (environment), SCTID 415540007. There are no added attributes like surface type or enclosure. Parents like sports field are too broad, and siblings (e.g., American football field) are incorrect. This does not imply a stadium or an indoor variant, so child concepts are not indicated."
282137003,Inch/second (qualifier value),Recorded unit: in/s (inches per second),"The unit is clearly inches per second, presented with the abbreviation in/s and its expansion for clarity. This is a Qualifier value concept, and SNOMED CT 282137003 represents inch/second precisely. No measurement magnitude or variable is stated, so no parent or child observable entity should be chosen. Parent unit categories are too general, and sibling speed units are different. The abbreviation and expanded synonym do not alter the unit and thus justify the same code."
288553000,Highway environment (environment),Highway area (environment),"By labeling 'highway area' and explicitly noting '(environment),' this describes the environmental setting associated with a highway. The main concept is environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment. It aligns with Highway environment (environment) SCTID 288553000 since it denotes the highway as the environmental area, not a general outdoor environment or a different place type. The phrasing does not introduce events or activities, keeping the mapping specific."
16615741000119105,History of posterior vitreous detachment (situation),Past ocular history: PVD,"Placing 'PVD' within the past ocular history indicates a prior posterior vitreous detachment, firmly in the historical situation context. The SNOMED CT category is Situation, with the exact match History of posterior vitreous detachment (16615741000119105). Coding to Posterior vitreous detachment (disorder) would misinterpret it as current. Parent history-of-eye conditions are too general, and sibling histories involving other ocular events are not accurate. The abbreviation PVD is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
223593008,Singapore (geographic location),Singapore — country,"The entry presents Singapore with the classification “country,” which accurately characterizes the geographic location. The main concept is the sovereign nation Singapore. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. This directly corresponds to SCTID 223593008 without suggesting any other context (e.g., residence, travel). A parent region (e.g., Southeast Asia) is not asserted, and no child locality within Singapore is referenced. The descriptor “country” is an equivalent characterization and does not change the code selection."
1365807001,Photographic intraoral direct image of inferior frontal view with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),"Record artifact: direct intraoral photograph, inferior frontal view, centric relation.","The entry explicitly frames this as a record artifact and describes a direct intraoral photograph with inferior frontal view and centric relation, mapping exactly to the SNOMED CT concept. The category is Record artifact. Parent concepts such as generic intraoral photo are less specific. Sibling concepts like mirror-view intraoral photos or occlusal/lateral views do not match. Using “centric relation” alone to indicate the jaw position is consistent and does not change the code."
218172003,Accident caused by industrial electric current (event),Industrial electric power current accident,"This entry denotes an accident caused by industrial electric current, with 'power current' functioning as a descriptive synonym for industrial electrical current without adding a distinct attribute. It fits the SNOMED CT Event concept 218172003. It remains more specific than the generic electric current accident and does not misclassify into domestic current or clinical outcomes, ensuring the event code is appropriate."
286470001,Ability to slice food (observable entity),Care plan focus—ability to slice food,"The entry notes care plan context but explicitly identifies the observable attribute: ability to slice food. It includes no outcome or qualifiers, preserving the concept as an Observable entity. SCTID 286470001 is appropriate due to its specificity to slicing food. Parent observables covering general feeding skills would be overly broad, and sibling observables involving other food preparation tasks would not match. The care plan context does not introduce new attributes or alter code selection."
161416007,History of malaria (situation),Malaria—history,"The phrasing 'Malaria—history' conveys that malaria is a historical condition for the patient. The concept here is a past occurrence of malaria, not a current disorder or exposure. In SNOMED CT this is a Situation with explicit context, and 'History of malaria (situation)' is the exact match. A parent such as 'Personal history of infectious disease' lacks disease specificity, while siblings or children like species-specific history would over-specify. Using 'Malaria (disorder)' would miscode the entry as active disease."
19358006,Cladosporium sphaerospermum (organism),Report notes Cladosporium sphaerospermum,"The entry reflects documentation noting the species Cladosporium sphaerospermum without implying disease or location. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. As the report simply names the organism, SCTID 19358006 is the best match. Parent or sibling concepts are less suitable because the species is precisely specified."
473107009,History of difficult fitting of intrauterine contraceptive device (situation),Nurse triage: known history of difficult IUD insertion,"This nurse triage note states a known history of difficult insertion of an IUD, which is equivalent to difficult fitting. Main concept: past difficult IUD fitting. Category: Situation with explicit context. SNOMED 473107009 is appropriate as it encodes the history of difficult fitting of an intrauterine contraceptive device. A sibling concept such as 'History of difficult removal of IUD' would misrepresent the event, and a finding-level 'Difficult insertion of IUD' would lack the history context. 'Insertion' is an accepted synonym for 'fitting' in IUD care."
69545006,Alnus glutinosa (organism),European alder (Alnus glutinosa),"“European alder” is a standard common name for Alnus glutinosa; the accompanying scientific name guarantees specificity. Category: Organism. The entry aligns with SNOMED 69545006 at the species level. Broader parents (genus Alnus, Plant) or sibling species are not supported by the wording. No additional attributes or product terms are present, avoiding misclassification to substances or findings."
1352591009,Union for International Cancer Control rpN3b (qualifier value),Staging descriptor: UICC rpN3b,"The entry records a staging descriptor explicitly as UICC rpN3b, denoting recurrent pathological N3b in the TNM scheme. The main concept is the staging qualifier value; SNOMED CT type is Qualifier value. The precise code is UICC rpN3b (1352591009). Higher-level parents (e.g., UICC rpN) or generic nodal stages (UICC N3) lack the rp and N3b specificity. Sibling qualifiers like rpN3a or rpN2 would incorrectly alter the nodal extent. The term “staging descriptor” is synonymous context and does not add attributes beyond the qualifier."
464533001,Oxygen therapy system (physical object),Oxygen administration system,"The term describes a system for administering oxygen, which is the intended function of an oxygen therapy system. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object, and the best match is Oxygen therapy system (SCTID: 464533001). It does not introduce details such as cannula, mask, concentrator, or location, which would align with more specific devices or settings. It also avoids procedural phrasing, ensuring the mapping stays with the device system rather than oxygen administration as a procedure."
110923006,Left lower lobe bronchus cytologic material (specimen),Cytology specimen labeled left lower lobe bronchus,"This entry documents a cytology specimen whose label identifies the source as the left lower lobe bronchus. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It is a direct match to 110923006 because it denotes cytologic material from the specified bronchial site. Parent concepts that don’t specify the lobar bronchus are less precise, and sibling concepts for other lobes or sides would be inaccurate. The phrasing about labeling doesn’t introduce extra attributes beyond the source."
258618008,Helminth specimen (specimen),Laboratory specimen—helminth,"This labels a laboratory specimen whose type is helminth, without elaborating on species, body source, or lifecycle stage. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. The best match is SCTID 258618008 Helminth specimen because the defining information is the helminth specimen type. Parent categories like parasite specimen are too general, and sibling categories such as protozoan specimen would be inaccurate. The lab-documentation phrasing is a paraphrase and clinically equivalent to the preferred term."
223865000,Bedfordshire (geographic location),Lived in Bedfordshire,"The phrase establishes Bedfordshire as the relevant geographic location where the person lived. The codable entity is Bedfordshire, mapping to Bedfordshire (geographic location) under the Location hierarchy. The temporal verb does not change the location being identified, and no other areas are stated, making SCTID 223865000 the correct choice over any parent or child/sibling concepts."
716937001,Structure of anterior apical part of peripheral zone of left half prostate (body structure),"Left-sided peripheral zone of prostate, anterior apical area","This phrase specifies the left half/side of the prostate’s peripheral zone and narrows to the anterior apical area, providing zone, subregion, and laterality. Category: Body structure. SCTID 716937001 is exact because it encodes the anterior apical part of the PZ in the left hemiprostate. More general parents (e.g., left PZ) are insufficiently specific. Siblings representing other quadrants (posterior apical) or right laterality would be incorrect. “Area” is interchangeable with “part/region” for anatomical description without changing the concept."
789134001,Mirrored visible image uncorrected flipped horizontally (record artifact),EHR photo is horizontally mirrored; not fixed,"The entry indicates that a photo within the EHR is horizontally mirrored and has not been fixed, i.e., remains uncorrected. The main concept is an uncorrected horizontal mirror artifact in a recorded visible image. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This matches SCTID 789134001 due to the specific orientation (horizontal) and the uncorrected state in the record. A broader artifact concept would be less specific, and siblings like corrected horizontal mirror or different orientation artifacts are excluded. 'Photo' is a type of visible image and does not alter the concept scope."
789135000,Mirrored visible image uncorrected (record artifact),"Left-right mirror artifact in a visible image, uncorrected in the record","The entry specifies a left-right mirror artifact affecting a visible image and notes it remains uncorrected in the record, clearly a data artifact. Category: Record artifact. This aligns precisely with SCTID 789135000; 'left-right mirror artifact' is synonymous with a mirrored visible image, and 'uncorrected' matches the concept requirement. More general artifact codes or alternative image errors would not be as accurate for this wording."
129230001,Transcranial approach (qualifier value),Transcranial pathway of approach,"This describes the pathway of approach as transcranial, meaning via the cranium. The main concept is the approach qualifier, fitting the SNOMED CT Qualifier value Transcranial approach (129230001). It does not introduce method, device, or site specifics, so alternative parents or sibling route qualifiers are less accurate."
424830006,Laser peripheral iridoplasty (procedure),Follow-up documentation: laser peripheral iridoplasty,"This follow-up note explicitly refers to 'laser peripheral iridoplasty' as the procedure, without introducing modifiers. The main concept is laser peripheral iridoplasty; SNOMED CT category: Procedure. It avoids cause, laterality, device specifics, or alternative techniques, keeping it distinct from iridotomy and broader iridoplasty. SCTID 424830006 is the most precise code."
371539003,Conference report (record artifact),Report—conference,"The main concept is a report associated with a conference, expressed with an em dash. No status, authorship, or other attributes are provided. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The best code match is Conference report (record artifact), SCTID 371539003, as it is a specific artifact subtype and the wording directly corresponds to a report of a conference. Mapping to a broader parent would be less precise. Siblings such as Meeting minutes or Proceedings denote different document genres (minutes vs. collections of papers), so they are less appropriate. The punctuation variant does not affect semantic equivalence to “Conference report,” so code selection remains unchanged."
103321005,Request by physician (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value),Physician request,"This concise phrase captures the contextual qualifier that the request originates from a physician, aligning with 'Request by physician (contextual qualifier)' (103321005). The main concept is solely the requester role (physician); no additional attributes like request type or timing are present. Category: Qualifier value. Using broader or different requester roles (e.g., patient or nurse) would map to sibling concepts and be less appropriate. 'Physician request' is a safe synonym meaning a request made by a physician, preserving the intended code."
223547005,Botswana (geographic location),Intake form lists: Botswana.,"This intake statement lists Botswana, the country, as the only codable concept. The SNOMED CT category is Location, and the best match is “Botswana (geographic location)” SCTID 223547005. The listing context does not introduce additional attributes or imply a different geographic entity; no parent, sibling, or child concept is indicated, ensuring precise coding to Botswana."
763182008,Program of study for child with special needs (record artifact),Program of study for child with special needs on file,"This states that the program of study for a child with special needs is on file, which is consistent with the Record artifact concept SCTID 763182008. 'On file' reflects documentation context and does not alter the conceptual meaning. More generic program-of-study records would be parents lacking the special-needs child aspect, and siblings such as individualized plans or service records are not invoked. The synonym preserves equivalence without additional attributes."
223923005,County Fermanagh (geographic location),Co. Fermanagh,"The entry uses the standard abbreviation “Co.” for “County,” referring explicitly to County Fermanagh as a geographic location. There are no additional attributes or context that would alter the concept. This maps directly to SNOMED CT 223923005 in the Geographic location (Location) hierarchy. Parent concepts are too broad, and child or sibling concepts (other counties or local districts) are not implied. The abbreviation is a clinically and administratively common synonym that does not change the code selection."
217620009,"Accident due to sudden air pressure change, aircraft climbing (event)",Accident attributed to sudden change in air pressure while aircraft climbing,"The entry describes an accident attributed to a sudden air pressure change occurring during aircraft climbing. The concept’s attributes—accident, sudden air pressure change, and climb phase—align with SCTID 217620009 in the Event hierarchy. It is more specific than broader pressure-change accidents and distinct from siblings that occur in non-climb phases. No injury details or other modifiers are present, keeping the code selection precise."
260580000,Transaortic approach (qualifier value),Access route: transaortic,"This indicates that the access route is transaortic, i.e., through the aorta. In SNOMED CT, this is a Qualifier value and aligns with 260580000 Transaortic approach. 'Access route' is a standard synonymic phrasing for approach and does not introduce new attributes such as technique guidance or timing. Sibling approaches (e.g., transfemoral) are explicitly not stated, and no procedure names are given, keeping the mapping strictly to the approach qualifier. Therefore, the transaortic approach code is the most accurate selection."
356376001,Gluten-free and wheat-free rice sliced loaf (product),Diet order: gluten-free and wheat-free rice sliced loaf,"A diet order listing the product still refers to the same item—a rice sliced loaf that excludes gluten and wheat. Category: Product. The order context does not modify attributes. Broader parents (generic gluten-free bread) and alternative siblings (unsliced loaf, non-rice base) are ruled out by the precise wording."
252970001,Stycar 10 letter test (procedure),Stycar 10 letter test,"The entry explicitly names the Stycar 10 letter test, which is a specific visual acuity procedure using the STYCAR ten-letter optotypes. The main concept is a named procedure, with no added attributes such as laterality, timing, or results. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Procedure category, and the most precise match is Stycar 10 letter test (procedure), SCTID 252970001. Broader parents like generic visual acuity testing or sibling procedures such as STYCAR picture tests or Snellen testing do not fit because the wording specifies the STYCAR 10-letter format. The phrasing is exact and does not alter the code selection."
122692002,Specimen from vagina obtained by excisional biopsy of lesion (specimen),"Accessioned specimen: vaginal lesion, excisional biopsy","This phrase denotes that a specimen has been accessioned in the lab and that it is from a vaginal lesion obtained by excisional biopsy. Concepts: specimen, vagina, excisional biopsy, lesion. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It directly corresponds to 122692002, specifying both the anatomical site and the technique applied to a lesion. A generic 'vaginal specimen' parent would not capture the excisional biopsy, and a sibling for incisional biopsy or different site would be incorrect. 'Accessioned specimen' indicates processing status but does not change the specimen concept."
263821009,Obstructed (qualifier value),Patency: obstructed,"“Patency: obstructed” directly uses the qualifier to describe patency status without adding site, degree, or cause. The main concept is the obstructed state of patency, which is a qualifier. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value, precisely matching Obstructed (qualifier value) [263821009]. It is not asserting a clinical finding or specifying a body structure, so disorder/finding codes would be over-specific. Siblings like Partially obstructed or Patent would alter the meaning and are not appropriate."
34909005,"Immunologic capping, function (observable entity)",Immunologic capping functional feature,"The term 'functional feature' remains a synonymic expression of an observable function related to immunologic capping, without introducing results or procedural context. It fits the Observable entity category and is more specific than general immune functions. It does not point to a child concept like impaired capping function or a method-specific measurement. Hence SCTID 34909005 is the correct, specific code."
37990009,"Tarsometatarsal arthrodesis, transverse (procedure)",Transversely oriented tarsometatarsal arthrodesis,"The phrasing states that an arthrodesis of the tarsometatarsal region was performed with a transverse orientation, directly aligning with the concept. This is a Procedure. No extra details about side, joint count, indication, or technique are included. Omitting the transverse orientation would map to a broader parent, and naming specific joints (e.g., first TMT/Lapidus) or other midfoot fusions would be inappropriate. The wording is a clear paraphrase that preserves the concept."
108709006,Product containing reverse transcriptase inhibitor (product),Drug product with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor,"This entry indicates a drug product that includes a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The most accurate mapping is to concept 108709006 because the phrasing centers on a product containing that inhibitor class, without extra attributes such as brand, route, specific compound name, or subclass (NRTI/NNRTI). A parent concept for generic drug products is too broad, and child concepts specifying the subtype or exact ingredient are too narrow. It does not represent a substance-only class or a clinical procedure, making the product-level RTI-containing concept the correct selection."
465646007,Synovectomy rongeur (physical object),Synovectomy rongeur inspected before case,"This entry documents pre-case inspection of a synovectomy rongeur, naming the object without specifying features. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. Synovectomy rongeur (physical object), SCTID 465646007, is the most accurate code as the instrument is explicitly identified. A general rongeur concept would be too broad, and no child-specific attributes are mentioned. Inspection context leaves the concept unchanged."
36232001,Mucinaminylserine mucinaminidase (substance),Reference substance—mucinaminylserine mucinaminidase,"The entry names the exact substance “mucinaminylserine mucinaminidase,” with “Reference substance” serving only as a contextual label. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Because the identity is specific, SCTID 36232001 is most accurate. Parent or sibling concepts would not preserve the stated specificity of the substance."
122589008,Serum specimen from blood donor (specimen),Serum obtained from blood donor,"This phrase identifies a serum specimen and the source as a blood donor; 'obtained' indicates collection consistent with specimen handling. Category: Specimen. SCTID 122589008 is the correct code capturing serum plus blood donor origin. Broader parents lacking either serum or donor detail are inferior matches. Sibling concepts for plasma or other blood components are not applicable. The phrasing avoids adding timing, volume, or test-specific attributes."
217886003,Accidentally struck by moving object (event),Event documented: accidentally struck by moving object,"This entry explicitly documents the event of accidental striking by a moving object, maintaining focus on the mechanism without adding injury or context details. The category is Event. It matches SCTID 217886003 exactly. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings (e.g., falling object, stationary object, vehicle) would add specificity not present. The wording remains semantically equivalent to the preferred term and does not change code selection."
218227004,Accident caused by noise pollution (event),Reason for visit: accident caused by noise pollution,"The reason-for-visit statement conveys an accident caused by noise pollution as the presenting issue. It fits the SNOMED Event category and matches SCTID 218227004. The entry does not add specifics such as type of accident or injury, so more granular child concepts are not indicated, and broader parent concepts without causative specification would be less precise."
737426005,Ankle brachial pressure index management plan (record artifact),Ankle-brachial index management plan documented,"The phrase confirms documentation of a management plan concerning the ankle-brachial index. The primary concept is the plan itself as a record artifact, without extra attributes like timing or associated conditions. This correctly maps to SNOMED CT 737426005, in the Record artifact category. A parent “management plan” concept would be too generic, and child or sibling concepts like ABI measurement results or procedural orders are not suitable because the entry clearly addresses documentation of the plan, not a measurement or order."
421349003,Inuvik region of Northwest Territories (geographic location),Inuvik region within Northwest Territories,"The phrase identifies a specific region located inside the Northwest Territories, namely the Inuvik region. This is a Geographic location and corresponds to SNOMED CT code 421349003. It avoids mapping to parent concepts because it narrows to the Inuvik region, and it avoids siblings like individual communities by explicitly stating 'region.' The wording is a paraphrase that maintains the same referent without altering meaning."
309128003,Eye fluid specimen (specimen),Ocular fluid sample,"This entry indicates a specimen sample of ocular fluid. The correct SNOMED CT category is Specimen, and the code Eye fluid specimen (309128003) is the most accurate because it represents fluid from the eye in general. It does not specify aqueous humor, vitreous humor, or tears, so child concepts are excluded. Using 'sample' instead of 'specimen' is clinically equivalent for coding purposes and does not change the intended concept."
124746006,Trousseau sign positive (situation),Observation result—Trousseau sign positive,"Here, the observation result explicitly states the Trousseau sign is positive, which is appropriately coded to the positive situation concept. It belongs in the Situation with explicit context hierarchy because the polarity result is given. Coding to a generic sign finding or to other neuromuscular findings would be less precise. The wording remains a clinically equivalent synonym without adding extra attributes."
897293009,Tracking device using global positioning system (physical object),Equipment log: GPS tracking device,"This entry logs a GPS tracking device as equipment, identifying the physical object used for GPS-based tracking. No added attributes are present. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The exact code is 'Tracking device using global positioning system' (SCTID 897293009). A more general parent tracking device would not specify GPS, and siblings using different technologies (e.g., RFID, cellular triangulation) are incorrect. 'GPS tracking device' is a clinically equivalent synonym that does not change the intended code."
275536003,History of thyroid disorder (situation),Known history of thyroid disease,"This indicates a documented prior thyroid disease in the patient, using ‘disease’ as a synonym for ‘disorder’ and clearly historical context. Category: Situation with explicit context. The match is History of thyroid disorder, not current thyroid disorder or subtype-specific histories. No family history or additional attributes are implied, making parent/sibling/child concepts less appropriate."
223976000,West Glamorgan (geographic location),West Glamorgan area,"The phrase denotes the area named West Glamorgan; 'area' is a descriptive noun that does not alter the identity of the location. In SNOMED CT this aligns with the Qualifier value for the geographic location West Glamorgan (SCTID 223976000). It does not imply a larger parent region like Wales or a different Glamorgan partition, and it avoids narrower places. Therefore, the code for West Glamorgan is the most precise match."
16829501000119100,History of gangrenous disorder (situation),Problem list (historical): gangrene,"This indicates gangrene is documented on the historical (not current) section of the problem list, reflecting past occurrence. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. It maps precisely to 'History of gangrenous disorder,' as no site, subtype, or cause is provided. Mapping to a generic parent 'History of disorder' would be too broad, and choosing a specific subtype or body site would introduce unsupported attributes. 'Gangrene' is a clinically equivalent term to gangrenous disorder."
468256004,Evoked-potential audiometer (physical object),Auditory evoked-response audiometer,"This entry uses 'evoked-response' within the auditory context and explicitly states 'audiometer', pointing to the specialized device for ERA/AEP audiometry. The main concept is a device for auditory evoked-response-based audiometric testing. Category: Physical object (device). It precisely matches 'Evoked-potential audiometer' (468256004) and is more specific than the generic audiometer parent. It avoids implying a particular EP subtype (e.g., brainstem), so child or sibling concepts would be less appropriate. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym without added attributes."
17871006,Infrared radiation (physical force),Infrared electromagnetic radiation,"The concept explicitly names the infrared band of electromagnetic radiation without adding context such as exposure or equipment. This belongs to the Physical force hierarchy, and the precise SNOMED match is Infrared radiation (physical force) SCTID 17871006. Specifying electromagnetic radiation in the infrared band aligns exactly with the target concept. Using a broader parent like Electromagnetic radiation would lose specificity, and selecting a child like Near infrared would be too narrow because no sub-band is mentioned. Sibling bands (ultraviolet, microwave) are excluded by the wording."
1382040005,Structure of intracranial segment of accessory nerve (body structure),Chart entry: intracranial segment of accessory nerve structure,"This chart entry names the body structure as the intracranial segment of the accessory nerve. The main concept is anatomical. The best SNOMED CT match is 'Structure of intracranial segment of accessory nerve' (SCTID 1382040005). Parent anatomy terms are too broad and omit the segment qualifier, while sibling concepts such as the extracranial segment or specific roots are incompatible with the stated intracranial segment."
223384006,Isle of Wight (geographic location),Location: Isle of Wight,The phrase contextualizes the mention as a location value and the only content to code is the place name “Isle of Wight.” SNOMED CT category: Location (Geographic location). This maps precisely to Isle of Wight (223384006). The context word ‘Location’ does not introduce a different concept; it frames the same geographic entity. Parent/sibling concepts would be less precise or incorrect.
81688003,Costovertebral joint structure (body structure),Articulation of rib with vertebral body,"The entry specifies the joint where the rib head articulates with the vertebral bodies and interposed disc, which is the costovertebral joint. Category: Body structure. SNOMED CT 81688003 is the exact match for the costovertebral joint structure. Broader parent joint concepts are not specific enough, and the costotransverse joint (sibling) involves the transverse process instead of the vertebral body. The wording remains clinically equivalent and does not add attributes."
789310004,Mirrored photographic image of teeth corrected flipped horizontally (record artifact),Data quality: mirrored image of teeth—horizontal flip correction completed.,"The data quality statement confirms a mirrored image of teeth that underwent horizontal flip correction, aligning with the 'Mirrored photographic image of teeth corrected flipped horizontally (record artifact)' concept. Category: Record artifact. Parent concepts are too broad, and siblings for non-teeth images or different flip directions would miscode the entry. The synonyms used ('mirrored', 'horizontal flip correction') maintain equivalence with the original term."
428283002,History of polyp of colon (situation),Patient reports a previous colon polyp,"The patient-reported statement denotes a prior occurrence of a colon polyp, conveying history rather than an active condition. The main concept is historical colon polyp, which is a Situation with explicit context. This maps precisely to History of polyp of colon (428283002). Family history is not implied, and no subtype or non-colon location is mentioned, so child or sibling concepts (e.g., history of rectal polyp) are not appropriate."
1365871001,Photographic intraoral image viewed through mirror and corrected of left buccal segment with teeth in centric relation (record artifact),"History image reference: left buccal segment intraoral photograph, mirror orientation corrected, centric relation teeth (record artifact).","This refers to a photographic intraoral image of the left buccal segment with mirror orientation corrected and teeth in centric relation, which is exactly the scope of SCTID 1365871001. The category is Record artifact because it characterizes the recorded image rather than a diagnostic finding or procedure. Parent artifacts lacking laterality or occlusal position, and sibling concepts for other segments or orientations, are less appropriate. The synonyms used (“photograph,” “mirror orientation corrected”) are equivalent and do not introduce new attributes."
41567002,Painted francolin (organism),Painted francolin,"The main concept is the organism named painted francolin, a specific bird species. No attributes such as timing, severity, sex, or causation are introduced. In SNOMED CT, this is an Organism class concept, and the most precise match is Painted francolin (organism) [SCTID: 41567002]. Selecting a parent concept like Francolin (organism), Bird (organism), or Aves would be less specific, and sibling species such as black or grey francolin would be incorrect. The entry uses the exact common name, which is clinically equivalent to the preferred term and does not change code selection."
704608006,Nepalese sign language (qualifier value),Identified as: Nepali Sign Language,"This entry identifies the language as 'Nepali Sign Language,' a clinico-linguistic synonym of 'Nepalese Sign Language.' It introduces no extra attributes such as preference, ability, or need. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. SCTID 704608006 is the exact match; parent 'Sign language' is too broad, and any sibling sign language would not fit the Nepal designation."
764880007,Product containing guanine nucleoside analog (product),Medication reconciliation line item: guanine nucleoside analog product,"The phrase specifies a reconciliation line item that is a product containing a guanine nucleoside analog. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Product hierarchy. SCTID 764880007 fits precisely because the product is defined by the guanine nucleoside analog ingredient class and does not state a particular agent, dose, or route. Parent concepts are too broad, and child concepts naming specific guanine analog drugs are too narrow for this generalized class-level reference."
1187241008,Island in region of French Polynesia (geographic location),Location of residence: island in French Polynesia,"The phrase identifies a location (island in French Polynesia) in the context of residence, but the core concept is the geographic place. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). The location itself—an island within French Polynesia—aligns with “Island in region of French Polynesia,” so SCTID 1187241008 is the correct code. The residence context does not change the place type or region. Parent concepts (region alone) and generic island concepts would be less specific; named islands would be children and too narrow; other place-type siblings would be incorrect."
417562008,Community care assessment requested (situation),Community care assessment requested by patient,"This specifies that the request originated from the patient yet still conveys the core concept: an assessment in community care is requested, which is a Situation with explicit context. SCTID 417562008 remains the correct code; the requester attribute does not change the situation type. It avoids implying performance, scheduling, or refusal, thus not mapping to sibling or child concepts."
703012009,Citrobacter werkmanii or Citrobacter youngae (finding),Species identified as Citrobacter werkmanii or youngae,"This explicitly frames the finding as species-level identification and preserves the alternative between Citrobacter werkmanii and Citrobacter youngae, matching the concept. It is a Clinical finding and introduces no extra attributes. Parent Citrobacter findings lack the specificity of these named species, and child concepts for a single species would not align with the ""or"" wording."
3330009,"Aminergic synaptic transmission, function (observable entity)",Aminergic synaptic transmission function,"The main concept is the functional property of aminergic synaptic transmission, expressed without any result, abnormality, or other attributes. This is an Observable entity in SNOMED CT, matching 3330009 precisely because it denotes the measurable or observable function of synaptic transmission mediated by amines. A more generic parent like “Synaptic transmission, function” would omit the aminergic specificity, and siblings such as “Cholinergic synaptic transmission, function” or “GABAergic synaptic transmission, function” would be incorrect given the wording. The entry uses the preferred phrasing and does not introduce timing, severity, or causation, making 3330009 the most accurate code."
284450005,Residential camp (environment),Residential camp,"The entry names the environment directly as a residential camp, which matches SNOMED CT concept Residential camp (environment), SCTID 284450005. The main concept is an environment type in which individuals reside at a camp. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This wording does not imply seasonal, refugee, military, or recreational campground variants, nor does it introduce timing, severity, or cause. Parent concepts like general residential institutions are too broad, and sibling concepts such as campgrounds or day camps are not appropriate because they lack the residential aspect. The term is an exact match and requires no alternative coding."
214868009,"Motor vehicle nontraffic accident involving collision, not on public highway, between motor vehicle, except off-road motor vehicle, and pedestrian, driver of motor vehicle injured (event)",Triage mechanism: motor vehicle–pedestrian crash off public highway; driver injured.,"The triage statement sets the mechanism as a motor vehicle–pedestrian crash, notes it occurred off the public highway (nontraffic), and identifies the driver as injured. This exactly fits SNOMED CT 214868009 (Event). Parents and siblings lacking either the nontraffic criterion, the pedestrian involvement, or the driver as the injured party would be less accurate. The entry avoids off-road vehicle implication and does not add details such as severity or location specificity beyond nontraffic."
266945001,Broken with partner (finding),Reports breakup with partner.,"The entry documents that the patient reports a breakup with their partner, which is a social-context Clinical finding. It aligns with Broken with partner (finding) SCTID 266945001. The reporting context does not change the coded concept or add attributes like timing or causation. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling codes for divorce or spouse separation are unsuitable because the term is “partner” and specifically denotes a breakup."
328570003,L-Arginine powder (product),L-Arginine powder preparation,"The term ""preparation"" in this context is a standard synonym for a pharmaceutical product and the dose form is powder. The SNOMED CT category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It matches SCTID 328570003, as it identifies L-Arginine prepared as a powder and does not add attributes like dosing, route, brand, or salt. Concepts for other forms (tablet, capsule) or different chemical forms (e.g., hydrochloride salt) are less appropriate since the entry strictly specifies the powder preparation of L-Arginine."
466723005,"Wound retractor, intermediate/deep (physical object)",Follow-up note: intermediate/deep wound retractor,"This entry presents the term within a follow-up note context, but the concept remains the intermediate/deep wound retractor physical object, aligning with SCTID 466723005. The main concept is the device; no attributes such as timing, site, or brand are introduced. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The intermediate/deep qualifier makes this more precise than the parent ‘wound retractor’ concept and excludes superficial sibling devices. The phrasing is clinically equivalent and supports the same code selection."
25567001,Hospital-based outpatient breast clinic (environment),Hospital outpatient breast services clinic,"The text denotes a hospital outpatient clinic providing breast services, i.e., a breast clinic in an outpatient hospital setting—an environment. SCTID 25567001 is the precise concept because it captures hospital-based, outpatient, and breast clinic attributes. More general parents or different siblings would miss one of these qualifiers, and no additional attributes like screening or multidisciplinary structure are implied. 'Services clinic' is a synonymous phrasing for a clinic and does not change the code."
162572001,Malignant neoplastic disease suspected (situation),Suspicious for malignancy,"Commonly used in clinical and imaging reports, 'suspicious for malignancy' indicates suspected malignant disease without confirmation or added details like site or type. The main concept is suspected malignant neoplastic disease. The SNOMED CT category is Situation with explicit context, making 'Malignant neoplastic disease suspected (situation)' the correct match. Mapping to a confirmed malignant neoplasm is not appropriate, and broader suspicion concepts lack the malignancy specificity. The phrase is a clinically equivalent synonym expressing suspicion and does not change code selection."
309206006,Pancreas biopsy specimen (specimen),Biopsy specimen of pancreas,"This is a direct paraphrase indicating the specimen is obtained via biopsy from the pancreas. The main concept is a specimen, not the procedure, and there are no extra attributes such as method detail or site subdivision. It belongs to the SNOMED CT Specimen hierarchy, with SCTID 309206006 being the precise concept. A parent concept like Biopsy specimen would be underspecified, and siblings distinguishing technique (core biopsy, FNA) or different organ sites would not fit the entry as written."
1365810008,Photographic intraoral image using photo accessory device modifier (record artifact),Record annotation: intraoral photograph captured with a photo accessory device,"This annotation states that the intraoral photograph was captured using a photo accessory device, which is a record artifact modifier. The main concept is a photographic intraoral image with the accessory device usage. It is categorized as a Record artifact in SNOMED CT. SCTID 1365810008 is the best match because it couples intraoral imaging and the 'using photo accessory device' modifier. Any parent code omitting accessory use would be less exact, child codes naming specific accessories would be overly granular, and siblings representing extraoral imaging or other techniques would not fit. The terms used are equivalent synonyms and maintain the same coding scope."
309949003,Pain management department (environment),Transferred to the pain management department,"This indicates a transfer destination that is the pain management department, a location/environment. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 309949003 precisely matches the departmental environment. It is not a clinic, unit, or service, so siblings would be less appropriate, and parents would be overly general. The transfer context does not modify the concept beyond identifying the location."
71437001,Histone-lysine methyltransferase (substance),Histone-lysine methyltransferase discussed with patient,"The entry names histone-lysine methyltransferase and only indicates a discussion context; the substance itself is the primary concept. SNOMED CT categorizes this as a Substance, matched by SCTID 71437001. Parent or sibling concepts (generic methyltransferases or arginine-directed histone methyltransferases) are not implied, as lysine specificity on histones is explicit. No specific enzyme subtype is introduced. The synonym is the preferred term and supports precise coding to the given concept."
4261000179100,Computed tomography imaging report (record artifact),CT imaging report,"The entry explicitly denotes the report artifact produced from a computed tomography (CT) imaging study, without introducing anatomy, contrast, timing, or status. This is a Record artifact in SNOMED CT and most precisely matches Computed tomography imaging report (record artifact) [4261000179100]. Concepts like CT procedure, CT images, or imaging findings are different hierarchies (Procedure, Image, Clinical finding) and would be incorrect. More generic parents such as Imaging report would be less specific. The abbreviation “CT” is a standard synonym for computed tomography and does not alter the code selection."
223391009,Montserrat (geographic location),Patient from Montserrat,"The statement identifies Montserrat as the patient's place of origin; the core concept is the geographic location itself. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location). Montserrat (geographic location) [223391009] is the precise code, since no larger region or smaller locality is described. Sibling or parent concepts (e.g., Caribbean) would be too general, and child concepts (e.g., a city within Montserrat) are not indicated."
91286005,Vipera mauritanica (organism),Diagnostic note: Vipera mauritanica identified,"The note states that Vipera mauritanica was identified, focusing solely on species determination. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The exact species name supports SCTID 91286005, whereas parent or sibling concepts would be less precise. The entry avoids any additional clinical or environmental attributes."
443581000124102,Modular protein formula component (product),Modular component—protein (formula),"This line identifies a modular component, specifies the macronutrient as protein, and situates it within a formula context, all of which define a modular protein formula component product. The SNOMED CT category is Product. The phrasing does not introduce route, quantity, or brand, thereby avoiding child concepts. It is more specific than the parent class “modular formula component” by adding the protein qualifier, and it excludes carbohydrate or lipid siblings. Thus, SCTID 443581000124102 is the correct, most specific match."
266903003,Family history: Biliary disease (situation),Intake form notes family history of biliary disease,"The context (intake form) shows documentation of a family history concerning biliary disease, with no added attributes such as specific disease names, relative degree, or timing. This is a Situation with explicit context and maps to SCTID 266903003. More general family history codes are insufficiently specific, and any code referencing a particular biliary disorder would be overly narrow for this entry."
720821001,Withdrawal sign (finding),Withdrawal sign on clinical evaluation,"This expression states the sign in the context of a clinical evaluation and is a Clinical finding that maps directly to SNOMED CT 720821001. There is no mention of reflex, pain, etiology, severity, or timing. Therefore, parent concepts are less specific and child/sibling concepts that add those attributes would be incorrect."
213981008,Injured by train door or window - passenger (event),Summary note: rail passenger injured by train door or window,"This summary indicates a rail (train) passenger was injured by a train door or window, with mechanism and role clearly stated. No additional attributes are introduced. It is an Event and maps to SCTID 213981008. Parent concepts lacking passenger role or sibling concepts tied to nonpassengers do not match the wording. “Rail passenger” is a clinically equivalent synonym for “train passenger.”"
405340003,Endarterectomy and angioplasty of popliteal artery with prosthesis (procedure),Endarterectomy and angioplasty (popliteal artery) with prosthesis.,"The parenthetical maintains the site specificity (popliteal artery), and the entry includes both endarterectomy and angioplasty, plus the prosthesis attribute, aligning with Procedure 405340003. Parent concepts without the site or prosthesis are less exact, and child/sibling concepts that specify stents, patches, or grafts are too detailed given the generic “prosthesis” wording. The synonyms used are standard and do not alter the intended code."
160331005,Family history: Manic-depressive state (situation),Family history notes bipolar affective disorder,"This documentation indicates that the family history notes bipolar affective disorder, a synonym for manic-depressive state. The concept is a Situation with explicit family history context and maps to 160331005. It does not describe patient diagnosis or introduce specificity such as type I/II or a named relative; thus, parent or child concepts would be less appropriate. The synonym preserves clinical equivalence without adding attributes."
1295412003,Glaucoma stage of left eye (observable entity),Glaucoma stage of left eye,"This phrase explicitly denotes the observable property “stage” of glaucoma for the left eye only. The main concept is glaucoma stage with the attribute of laterality (left eye). The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 1295412003 precisely represents the left-eye-specific glaucoma stage. More general parent concepts like “Glaucoma stage” lack laterality and are less specific, while child concepts that include a particular stage value (e.g., mild or severe) are not stated here. Sibling concepts such as “Glaucoma stage of right eye” are excluded by the left-eye wording. The wording does not introduce a diagnosis or severity value; it remains an observation label for the left eye."
112284001,Genus Providencia (organism),Providencia (genus),"This phrase explicitly states the genus name Providencia, indicating an organism classification at the genus level and not referring to any species or clinical condition. Category: Organism. It maps directly to SNOMED CT 112284001 rather than broader parent categories (e.g., Bacteria) or sibling genera (e.g., Proteus). It does not imply infection, detection, or site, making the genus concept the most accurate code."
350098009,Product containing fixed oil (product),Fixed oil-based product,"“Fixed oil-based” signifies a product whose base or composition includes fixed oil, aligning with the concept of a product containing fixed oil. The main concept is a product; the attribute is the presence of fixed (nonvolatile, fatty) oil. The SNOMED CT category is Product, and 350098009 is the most appropriate code. A broader product concept without reference to fixed oil would be less specific, and a child concept for a particular fixed oil would over-specify. The synonym reflects the same ingredient inclusion without changing code selection."
288608007,Difficulty using the elements of language (finding),Impaired language use,"This succinct phrase conveys impaired language use, a Clinical finding centered on using language elements for expression. It functions as a synonym for difficulty using the elements of language without implying a formal diagnosis or subtype, aligning with SCTID 288608007. Parent categories are too general, and child/sibling concepts (e.g., aphasia, word-finding difficulty, receptive deficits) are not supported by the wording."
246979007,Scleral vascularity (observable entity),Ocular chart entry: scleral vascularity,"This denotes that the ocular chart includes an entry for scleral vascularity, referencing the observable parameter without any qualifiers or results. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, with Scleral vascularity (SCTID: 246979007) as the appropriate code. No attributes such as laterality, severity, or abnormality are added. Parent observables are too general, and sibling observables relate to different ocular structures. The charting context is neutral and clinically equivalent to the underlying observable concept."
405074005,Social interaction skills (observable entity),Social interaction skills noted,"The phrase indicates documentation context but the concept being referenced remains the observable property of social interaction skills. This is an Observable entity and corresponds to SNOMED CT 405074005. No values or judgments are provided (e.g., normal or impaired), and no procedure is directly stated beyond simple note-taking. Parent concepts would be too general, and child or sibling concepts implying specific sub-skills or deficits are not supported by the wording."
45156000,Rubivirus (organism),Virology term: Rubivirus,"As a virology terminology entry, “Rubivirus” denotes the organism concept Rubivirus (organism) (SCTID 45156000). Category: Organism. The entry is free of clinical findings or disorder implications. Parent classes such as “Virus (organism)” are too general, while any species-specific child would be more specific than the stated term. The context label “Virology term” does not change the code selection."
713357001,Methiosulfonium chloride (substance),Pharmacy stock: methiosulfonium chloride,"In a stock context, the named item remains the chemical substance methiosulfonium chloride, fitting SNOMED CT 713357001 in the Substance hierarchy. No product strength, route, or brand is specified, avoiding medicinal product concepts. Parents like general ‘chemical’ are too broad; siblings such as other salts or derivatives are not invoked."
423618006,Milliliter/kilogram/minute (qualifier value),Standard unit mL/kg/min,"The phrase designates mL/kg/min as the standard unit, referring to milliliters per kilogram per minute. It is a Qualifier value best coded as SCTID 423618006. The entry does not include any measurement attribute or result, ensuring it maps only to the unit concept. Broader unit categories or different dimensional units would not be as precise."
702851008,Down syndrome clinic (environment),Location: Down syndrome clinic,"This entry specifies the location of care as a Down syndrome clinic, which matches SNOMED CT 702851008, an environmental context. The main concept is the clinic environment, not a disorder or service line. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. Using a parent code like Clinic (environment) would lose the condition-specific precision, and alternative siblings like Down syndrome center (environment) are not appropriate because the term explicitly says clinic. No extra attributes have been introduced."
7783003,Structure of sympathetic trunk spinal nerve branch (body structure),Intraoperative note: sympathetic trunk spinal nerve branch visualized,"The entry situates the anatomical structure in an operative context but still names only the structure—the spinal nerve branch of the sympathetic trunk. It is a Body structure and correctly aligns with the SNOMED concept. No fiber specificity, level, or laterality is introduced, avoiding child concepts, and it is more precise than broader parent structures or unrelated sibling branches."
224034003,Keewatin (geographic location),Keewatin,"The entry names the geographic place Keewatin without any qualifiers or added attributes. The main concept is the place name itself, which aligns directly with SNOMED CT concept Keewatin (geographic location) [224034003]. Category: Geographic location (Location). This is the most precise match because no jurisdictional detail (e.g., province, country) or subtype (e.g., district, town) is introduced; using a parent like Geographic location would be too general, and any child or sibling concepts that specify a subtype of Keewatin are not indicated by the wording."
309936008,Nephrology department (environment),Nephrology department,"The entry states the environment as a specific hospital/healthcare department dedicated to nephrology. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. This exactly matches the preferred term for SCTID 309936008 and denotes the physical/organizational care setting without adding qualifiers like inpatient/outpatient, pediatric/adult, or unit/ward. Broader parents such as hospital department (environment) are less precise, and siblings like urology department or dialysis unit would be incorrect. No additional attributes are introduced."
740514001,Total hysterectomy with right salpingectomy (procedure),"Total hysterectomy, right fallopian tube removed","This entry indicates that a total hysterectomy was done (uterus and cervix removed) and the right fallopian tube was removed (right salpingectomy). The concept is a combined Procedure. SCTID 740514001 is the exact match because it includes both components and the right laterality. Parent codes that represent only hysterectomy or only salpingectomy are incomplete, and sibling codes that specify different laterality, bilateral tube removal, or surgical approach would add attributes not present. The phrasing is a concise, clinically safe synonym for the preferred concept."
257494002,Thunder (event),Weather observation: thunder,"A report-style phrasing noting thunder within a weather context, yet naming only thunder. Category: Event. Thunder (event) SCTID 257494002 fits best. Broader parent weather events or sibling thunderstorm are not appropriate because the entry does not include storm elements."
224012000,Region of Canada (geographic location),Regional location in Canada,"The phrase conveys a regional-level location inside Canada. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. As an equivalent expression of “Region of Canada,” it fits SCTID 224012000 and does not imply a particular named region or a different geographic granularity such as city or province, ruling out parent, sibling, or child alternatives."
736058004,Mental health personal health plan (record artifact),Diagnostic report notes mental health personal health plan,"The main concept remains the mental health personal health plan artifact, with the context that a diagnostic report mentions it. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. Referencing it in a report does not convert the concept into a procedure or a different artifact; it still points to the personal health plan in the mental health domain, so 736058004 is the most precise code. Parent-level “Personal health plan” would be too generic, and sibling artifacts like care or treatment plans would be inaccurate for this wording."
470013004,Foam-filled chair cushion (physical object),Chair foam cushion,"This wording indicates a cushion for a chair made of foam, i.e., foam-filled. It is a Physical object. The chair context and foam material are both present, matching SCTID 470013004. A broader 'chair cushion' would lack material detail, and cushions designed for other devices would be incorrect for this entry."
46203002,Bivalving of cast (procedure),Cast bivalving performed,"The entry indicates that the procedure of bivalving a cast was performed, without specifying indications, timing, or laterality. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps to Bivalving of cast (procedure), SCTID 46203002, representing the exact technique of making two cuts to split the cast into two halves. It is not removal, not windowing, and not univalving, so sibling codes are inappropriate. More general parent categories for cast manipulation are too vague, making this procedure code the best fit."
61946003,Product containing estrogen receptor agonist (product),Prescribed estrogen receptor agonist product,"This indicates a prescribed product whose active ingredient is an estrogen receptor agonist, aligning with SCTID 61946003. The category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. The prescribing context does not introduce attributes that would necessitate a more specific code (e.g., route, formulation, dose, or a specific named agent). The term 'product' directly corresponds to the SNOMED product hierarchy and is an appropriate synonym."
64405002,Structure of joint of cervical vertebra other than atlas or axis (body structure),Articulation of cervical vertebra excluding atlas and axis—structure,"Using 'articulation' as a synonym for 'joint,' the entry identifies an anatomical joint of the cervical vertebrae and excludes atlas/axis. This is a Body structure concept. The exclusion clause aligns directly with SNOMED CT 64405002. A parent concept would include articulations at C1/C2, which is not intended. No specification of joint type (facet, uncovertebral) or level is present, avoiding child concepts. The synonym 'articulation' is clinically equivalent."
277854006,Field pattern reversal (qualifier value),Reversed field pattern,"This phrasing conveys the same qualifier in adjective form, meaning the field pattern has undergone reversal. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It aligns with SCTID 277854006, preserving both 'field pattern' and the reversal attribute. Removing 'field' would overgeneralize, and adding domain qualifiers would overly constrain the concept; thus, this is the most precise code selection."
223994006,West Falkland (geographic location),Patient-reported location: West Falkland,"The phrase indicates patient-provided context, but the only codable entity is the geographic name West Falkland; no added qualifiers such as event or condition are included. The main concept is the location. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. SCTID 223994006 is exact, whereas parent or sibling concepts would not match. The patient context does not introduce a different concept—it remains the named place."
445384000,Hemodialysate specimen from hemodialysis machine using reverse osmosis system (specimen),Collection note: hemodialysate specimen from reverse osmosis hemodialysis apparatus,"The collection note indicates a hemodialysate specimen and specifies the apparatus is a hemodialysis machine using reverse osmosis. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This maps directly to 445384000, which is defined as hemodialysate from an RO hemodialysis machine. Without the RO qualifier, a parent concept would be more appropriate; using terms like 'water' would lead to sibling concepts. The synonyms 'apparatus' and 'hemodialysate' preserve the clinical meaning without adding attributes."
32888000,Radioactivity (physical force),Radioactivity included in diagnostic summary,"This phrase includes radioactivity within a diagnostic summary context while avoiding any exposure, measurement, or subtype attributes. The concept is a Physical force. Radioactivity (physical force) [32888000] is the precise code. Broader radiation concepts or hazard/exposure situations would not match the wording because only the phenomenon is referenced. The context 'included in diagnostic summary' does not alter the underlying concept."
1306626008,Photographic extraoral image of right half of face with full smile and jaws in centric relation (record artifact),"Clinic photo—extraoral right-side facial half, full smile in centric relation.","This item identifies a clinic photo that is extraoral, restricted to the right facial half, with a full smile and centric relation mandibular positioning. The category is Record artifact. The wording includes all defining attributes of the concept, keeping it distinct from broader extraoral photos and from siblings that differ in laterality or occlusal state. Terms like “right-side facial half” and “photo” are equivalent synonyms for right half-face and photograph, preserving the exact mapping."
223730006,Cape Province (geographic location),Site: Cape Province (geographic location),"The content names the site as 'Cape Province' and explicitly notes it is a geographic location, matching the intended concept. The main concept is the province-level geographic entity. SNOMED CT code: Cape Province (geographic location) [223730006], category: Geographic location. Broader parents like South Africa or narrower/different provinces (Western/Eastern/Northern Cape) are not referenced. The parenthetical clarifier reinforces the correct semantic category without adding new attributes."
242420000,Fall into sewer (event),Event: fell into sewer,"The entry labels the occurrence as an event and states the fall into a sewer. This directly corresponds to SNOMED CT “Fall into sewer (event)” SCTID 242420000, an Event category concept. No additional attributes like intent, injury, or timing are introduced. Parents that omit location detail or siblings referring to different environments would be less accurate. The past-tense verb form “fell” is a clinically equivalent synonym and does not change code selection."
285317002,Vaginal marker (physical object),Vaginal marker part number,"Referencing a part number still denotes the specific device object, not a procedure or clinical finding, and does not introduce additional attributes such as material or function. Therefore, Vaginal marker (physical object) [285317002] in the Physical object category is the most accurate code. Generic marker or device categories are too broad, and specialized variants are not implied by the text."
1841000175109,Every two hours as required (qualifier value),two-hourly as needed,"The entry uses the synonym “two-hourly” to convey every two hours, paired with “as needed” for PRN. The concept is a frequency qualifier with conditional administration. Category: Qualifier value. SCTID 1841000175109 is the exact match as it combines both the q2h interval and PRN condition. Parent concepts containing only one element (e.g., just the interval or just PRN) would be insufficient, and sibling concepts with different intervals (e.g., three-hourly) or non-PRN schedules would be incorrect. The term “two-hourly” is clinically equivalent to “every two hours.”"
217158009,Fall on moving sidewalk (event),Fall on the moving walkway (travelator),"This entry specifies a fall on the moving walkway and includes the synonym travelator in parentheses to clarify the device context. The main concept is fall; the explicit attribute is the moving walkway/sidewalk device. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 217158009 is the most accurate code since it represents falls on moving sidewalks. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling concepts (e.g., falls on escalators) describe different mechanisms. The parenthetical synonym does not add attributes; it reinforces equivalence, keeping the event coding precise."
102404009,Temperature extreme (physical force),Extreme temperature (physical force),"This phrasing expresses the same physical phenomenon as the preferred term by reversing word order, retaining the concept of an environmental temperature at extreme levels without specifying hot or cold. It maps to the Physical force category, making SNOMED CT 102404009 the correct code. Broader parents (Physical force) lack specificity, while children such as heat or cold-specific forces introduce attributes not stated. The synonym “extreme temperature” is clinically equivalent and does not alter code selection."
16213331000119104,Rectosigmoid colon biopsy specimen (specimen),Patient reports a biopsy sample from the rectosigmoid colon,"Despite patient-facing phrasing, the content specifies a biopsy sample and the site as the rectosigmoid colon, which corresponds to the SNOMED concept “Rectosigmoid colon biopsy specimen”. Main concept: biopsy specimen from rectosigmoid colon. Category: Specimen. The patient-report context is semantic framing and does not add procedural details or other attributes. Parent and sibling concepts either lack the precise segment or refer to different adjacent sites, so the exact rectosigmoid biopsy specimen code remains appropriate."
216451000,"Place of occurrence of accident or poisoning, reservoir (environment)",Scene of accident or poisoning: reservoir environment.,"The entry specifies the scene of the accident/poisoning as a reservoir environment, limiting content to the location. The main concept is the scene/place-of-occurrence for an external cause event; the attribute is 'reservoir'. SNOMED CT category: Context-dependent category. It aligns exactly with 216451000 and avoids crossing into other water features or more general environments. 'Reservoir environment' is a clinically equivalent paraphrase that retains the intended meaning."
223754001,Shikoku (geographic location),四国,"This is the Japanese name for Shikoku and is a direct, safe synonym for the same geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location (Geographic location). It introduces no new attributes, so it maps precisely to Shikoku (geographic location), SCTID 223754001. Broader locations (Japan) or sublocations (specific prefectures) are not expressed; sibling regions are not implied."
411820000,Chaetomium globosum diagnostic allergen extract (product),Immunology lab: Chaetomium globosum diagnostic allergen extract,"The entry names the product as a Chaetomium globosum diagnostic allergen extract, with “Immunology lab” simply providing context. The SNOMED CT category is Product, consistent with SCTID 411820000. It specifies diagnostic use and the extract form, avoiding mapping to therapeutic allergens or to allergen substance concepts. The species detail refines it beyond a generic parent diagnostic allergen extract, and no procedure, dose, or route attributes are present."
367686001,Entire subcutaneous tissue of clitoris (body structure),Documented anatomy: entire clitoral subcutaneous layer,"The entry records an anatomical site, specifying the entire subcutaneous layer (synonymous with subcutis/hypodermis) of the clitoris. As a Body structure, it maps to SCTID 367686001. Parents like “clitoris” or “female genital subcutaneous tissue” are broader, and siblings such as non-entire clitoral subcutaneous tissue or clitoral skin do not match the explicit ‘entire layer’ wording. The paraphrase is semantically equivalent and adds no attributes."
81362008,Hexobarbital (substance),Hexobarbital,"The entry states the precise substance name “Hexobarbital” without any qualifiers such as salt form, dosage, route, or brand. The main concept is the chemical/drug substance hexobarbital. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This maps exactly to Hexobarbital (substance), SCTID 81362008, because it refers to the base compound itself. Parent concepts like Barbiturate (substance) are too general, and child or sibling concepts such as Hexobarbital sodium (substance) or hexobarbital-containing product would introduce formulation or product attributes not present here. No additional attributes are implied, ensuring the substance-level concept is the most precise match."
227604000,Marmalade (substance),Dietetic assessment includes: marmalade,"The entry names marmalade within a dietetics assessment, referencing the substance directly. The SNOMED category is Substance, mapped to Marmalade (substance) SCTID 227604000. Inclusion in an assessment is contextual and does not add modifiers or subtype attributes. Broader food categories or alternate preserves would be less accurate, so the marmalade substance code is the correct selection."
370565006,Fear-related aggression (finding),Aggression associated with fear,"The entry states an association between aggression and fear, which in this clinical context denotes aggression occurring in relation to fear. The main concept is aggressive behavior linked to fear, fitting Fear-related aggression (finding), SCTID 370565006, categorized as a Clinical finding. This is more precise than non-specific aggressive behavior and avoids unrelated siblings (e.g., irritability or anger). The phrasing is a synonym and does not introduce new attributes."
223824000,Ionian island (geographic location),Island within the Ionian Islands,"This entry conveys a single island that belongs to the Ionian Islands archipelago, making it semantically equivalent to 'Ionian island' without adding other details. It belongs to the Geographic location hierarchy in SNOMED CT, with the correct concept Ionian island (geographic location), SCTID 223824000. The collective archipelago term (parent) would be broader, and specific named islands (children) are not specified, nor is the nearby sea (sibling)."
732293002,Salivary calculus specimen (specimen),Stone specimen identified as salivary calculus,"The entry clarifies that a stone specimen has been identified specifically as a salivary calculus. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. The identification refines the stone to the salivary system, matching 732293002. A generic ‘stone specimen’ parent concept would be under-specified, and siblings such as renal or biliary stone specimen would be incorrect. No additional attributes like precise site or laterality are included."
72407007,Pneumonyssus duttoni (organism),Research specimen organism: Pneumonyssus duttoni,"In a research context, naming the specimen organism as Pneumonyssus duttoni remains a pure taxonomic reference. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the best match is Pneumonyssus duttoni (SCTID 72407007). Using a parent taxon would be nonspecific, and selecting a sibling species would be incorrect. The wording avoids clinical states or findings, so the species-level organism concept is appropriate."
407548008,Stoma bag leaking (finding),Clinic note: leakage of stoma bag,"This clinic documentation describes leakage of the stoma bag and does not specify cause, severity, or stoma type. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. SCTID 407548008 'Stoma bag leaking (finding)' precisely fits the described finding. Parent/sibling concepts that generalize to appliance problems or describe other failure types are not indicated."
1149430001,World Health Organization classification of tumors histologic grading system fifth edition (staging scale),WHO 5e tumor histology grading system,"This entry uses '5e' to denote the fifth edition and names the WHO tumor histology grading system, aligning with the SNOMED CT staging scale concept for WHO fifth edition histologic grading (SCTID: 1149430001). The main concept is the scale; no grade values or other attributes are included. Category: Qualifier value—Staging scale. A parent concept without edition would be less specific. Sibling scales are not mentioned. The abbreviation '5e' is a common shorthand for 'fifth edition' and does not change the semantic scope, ensuring the same code selection."
72920000,Centropristis fuscula (organism),Scientific name: Centropristis fuscula,"This entry presents the organism as its scientific name, directly pointing to the species Centropristis fuscula. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and SCTID 72920000 is the exact species-level match. The phrase 'Scientific name' is a contextual descriptor that does not alter the concept, making parent genus-level or related species-level codes less appropriate."
411701005,Honey diagnostic allergen extract (product),Lab reagent: honey allergen extract (diagnostic),"Identifies a laboratory reagent for diagnostics comprising a honey-derived allergen extract. Category: Product. This corresponds to 411701005, with no added attributes regarding dose, route, or therapy. Parent concepts fail to capture the honey source, and sibling therapeutic or substance concepts are excluded by the diagnostic reagent wording."
230830007,Removal of subdural-pleural shunt (procedure),Removal of subdural–pleural shunt performed,"This phrasing documents performance of the removal Procedure on a subdural–pleural shunt, which maps directly to SCTID 230830007. It excludes insertion/revision and adds no extraneous attributes. Generic parent codes for shunt removal lack the specific pathway, and sibling codes for other shunt types are incorrect given the explicit subdural–pleural designation."
718253003,Corneal marker handpiece (physical object),Label reads “corneal marker handpiece”,"The device label explicitly states corneal marker handpiece, indicating the handpiece component of a corneal marker instrument. This is a Physical object (device) exactly matching SNOMED CT 718253003. The labeling context does not add attributes that would change code selection. Generic handpieces or full corneal markers would not be as precise."
251435008,Tip pinch (observable entity),Tip pinch included in hand evaluation,"This entry defines tip pinch as a component of the evaluation without adding numeric results or additional properties. The core observable is tip pinch, fitting Tip pinch (observable entity), SCTID 251435008. Parent pinch categories are too broad, and no indication of lateral/key or three-point pinch is present. No strength, severity, or side attribute is included, keeping the mapping specific to the stated concept."
411590003,Hamster epithelium diagnostic allergen extract (product),Product label: hamster epithelium diagnostic allergen extract,"Labeling language still names the product as a diagnostic allergen extract from hamster epithelium. Category: Product. This directly corresponds to SNOMED CT 411590003. General parents and alternative-source siblings are not appropriate because the entry specifies the exact species and tissue and the diagnostic purpose. The wording does not add attributes such as packaging details, concentration, or test method, preserving an unambiguous mapping to the product concept."
397091005,Surgical proximal margin involvement by in situ carcinoma/adenoma not applicable (finding),Proximal margin evaluation for in situ carcinoma/adenoma involvement: N/A.,"The entry frames an evaluation of proximal margin involvement by in situ carcinoma/adenoma and reports 'N/A' (not applicable). This is a Clinical finding. The concept 397091005 corresponds exactly. Selecting a more general margin item, a distal margin item, or a present/absent result would not align with the explicit 'not applicable' status tied to the proximal margin and in situ carcinoma/adenoma."
2001000175105,White blood cells per high power field (qualifier value),Microscopic count expressed in WBC per HPF,"The entry conveys that microscopic counts are expressed using the unit ‘white blood cells per HPF.’ SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It matches the concept precisely, specifying the analyte and per-HPF basis. Mentioning ‘microscopic’ is contextual and does not change the unit or add attributes like specimen type, so parent/sibling concepts remain less suitable."
108469007,Pergolide mesilate (substance),Pergolide methanesulfonate,"The term 'methanesulfonate' is the chemical name for the mesylate salt, denoting the same substance and mapping to SNOMED CT Substance 108469007. The entry contains no formulation, dose, or therapeutic context, avoiding product or procedure codes. It specifically identifies the pergolide methanesulfonate salt, making parent concepts like 'Pergolide (substance)' too general and sibling salts inappropriate."
422500006,Dryocopus martius (organism),Scientific name: Dryocopus martius,"Specifying the scientific name directly points to the species-level organism concept. The SNOMED CT category is Organism, and the correct code is SCTID 422500006. The label 'Scientific name' does not add clinical attributes or context such as exposure; it prevents confusion with common names that might be broader and ensures species-specific mapping rather than to a parent or sibling."
50105002,"Undetermined manner of death, natural causes suspected (event)","History update: prior death recorded as undetermined manner, natural suspected.","This history documentation frames a prior event whose manner of death was recorded as undetermined with natural suspected, mapping precisely to SCTID 50105002. It stays within Event classification and does not provide cause or definitive manner, thereby excluding sibling concepts. The natural-suspected element makes it more accurate than the generic undetermined manner parent concept without adding extraneous features."
39891004,Injection of thoracic and abdominal artery (procedure),History item: injection into thoracic and abdominal arteries,"The content denotes an injection into thoracic and abdominal arteries noted in a history context, but the clinical act remains the arterial injection across both regions. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. This maps to SCTID 39891004 by explicitly indicating arterial injection and the two anatomical areas. Parents are less specific and siblings limited to single-region or named arteries would not fit. No additional attributes such as agent, selectivity, or timing details are introduced beyond the neutral context."
4036002,Arthroscopy of elbow with extensive debridement (procedure),Arthroscopy of elbow—extensive debridement performed,"This sentence conveys that an elbow arthroscopy was performed and that the included debridement was extensive. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. It precisely aligns with SCTID 4036002 because it pairs the arthroscopic approach with the ‘extensive debridement’ qualifier. It would not be better mapped to a parent concept like arthroscopy of elbow alone, nor to a sibling such as limited debridement, because ‘extensive’ is clearly stated. The construction is a clinically equivalent paraphrase and does not add attributes beyond those in the concept."
367559008,Preparation - action (qualifier value),Procedure action identified as preparation,"The phrase identifies the procedure’s action as 'preparation,' placing it in the Qualifier value category. It exactly fits SNOMED CT 367559008 by naming the action without any object or site specification. It should not be misread as a full procedure (e.g., patient preparation) because the wording is solely about the action attribute. Parent action qualifiers are too broad, and other action siblings are non-equivalent. The entry remains a clinically equivalent expression of the same concept."
78621006,Physical force (physical force),Clinician notes: physical force,"The documentation mentions physical force as a concept without specifying subtype or clinical consequences, keeping it general. This aligns with Physical force (physical force) SCTID 78621006 in the Physical force hierarchy. The inclusion of 'Clinician notes' is contextual and does not introduce attributes like cause or severity. More specific forces are not named, so child concepts would be over-specific. The base concept is the correct, most precise match."
252560008,Smell bottle olfaction test (procedure),Smell bottle olfaction test performed,"The main concept is the smell bottle olfaction test, with 'performed' indicating it took place but not altering the procedure identity or adding result attributes. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The specific method supports coding to Smell bottle olfaction test (252560008). Parent concepts like generic olfactory testing are too broad, and other smell test methods are siblings and not indicated."
737108000,Immunoglobulin G synthesis rate calculation technique (qualifier value),Workflow instruction: apply immunoglobulin G synthesis rate calculation technique,"This instruction designates the technique to apply as the calculation of IgG synthesis rate. The concept is a Qualifier value specifying method choice, independent of results or procedural performance details. It matches SCTID 737108000 due to explicit identification of IgG and the synthesis rate calculation technique. Broader parents like 'apply calculation technique' lack specificity, and siblings for other immunoglobulins or different IgG measures do not match. The imperative form does not add attributes and retains the same technique meaning."
424022009,Somateria spectabilis (organism),Somateria spectabilis (organism),"This entry explicitly presents the taxon Somateria spectabilis and clarifies it is an organism, aligning directly with the species-level Organism concept in SNOMED CT. The category is Organism. It is the most accurate match to 424022009 because it names the specific species and matches the preferred term. Using parent concepts (e.g., Somateria genus) would be overly broad, while siblings (common eider, spectacled eider) denote other species. The phrasing does not add attributes like exposure or observation; it is purely the organism designation, so the species code remains the precise selection."
1208419007,Finding of presence of substance (finding),Clinical note: substance present,"This contextualizes the finding within a clinical note, stating that a substance is present. No details about identity, specimen, or body site are provided, maintaining the general nature of the finding. It appropriately maps to Finding of presence of substance (finding) [1208419007] under Clinical findings. More specific descendant codes are not justified, and sibling concepts for positive tests are less suitable. The synonymic phrasing preserves the same semantic content."
411951008,Chrysanthemum leucanthemum specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Chrysanthemum leucanthemum diagnostic allergen testing extract,"The phrase denotes an extract used for allergy testing and specifies Chrysanthemum leucanthemum as the source. The core concept is the diagnostic allergen extract Product, which maps to SCTID 411951008. It does not state a specific procedure type (e.g., skin prick) or therapeutic use, nor does it add concentration or component details, thereby avoiding child or sibling concepts. A generic diagnostic extract would be less precise than this species-specific entry."
647981000005104,Use of nicotine (observable entity),Social history: nicotine use,"Placed in social history context, the entry still denotes the observable of nicotine use without temporal qualifiers beyond documentation context, nor product/route or disorder implications. The correct SNOMED category is Observable entity, and the precise code is Use of nicotine (observable entity) [647981000005104]. Coding to Use of tobacco or Nicotine dependence would be inaccurate because those introduce attributes not stated here."
1184593002,Vital sign document section (record artifact),Consult note: Vital signs section,"This entry specifies the vital signs section within a consultative note, indicating a document structural element. It is a Record artifact. SNOMED CT 1184593002 is the best match as it codes the vital sign document section regardless of note type. Using a broader document section code would be imprecise, and choosing vital signs as findings or observable entities would be wrong since no measurements or clinical content are described."
1217437002,Pronator quadratus muscle flap (substance),Specified tissue: pronator quadratus muscle flap,"The text specifies the tissue as a pronator quadratus muscle flap, indicating a material in the Substance hierarchy. The correct code is 1217437002. Using a generic parent would omit the specific muscle, and siblings would name a different source muscle. The phrasing introduces no new attributes such as timing, laterality, or flap type, maintaining precise alignment."
257123006,DQB1*0402 (substance),HLA-DQ beta 1*0402,"This synonym uses the expanded chain designation (DQ beta 1) with the allele *0402, still referring to the identical substance. Main concept: HLA-DQ β1 allele product DQB1*0402. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This aligns exactly with 257123006; parent concepts like HLA-DQ β1 antigen are too general, and sibling alleles (e.g., *0401) are different. It does not introduce attributes such as test results or clinical associations."
1306744008,European Union certificate of authorization to obtain planned treatment (record artifact),Imaging registration: Certificate authorising planned treatment — European Union,"The entry names the EU certificate authorising planned treatment and situates it in an imaging registration context. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The context label does not modify the artifact; it simply indicates where it was referenced. The specificity to EU and planned treatment excludes broader certificates and unrelated EU documents (e.g., EHIC), keeping this concept as the precise match. No clinical attributes are introduced."
709967004,Antibody to Ross river virus (substance),Antibody to Ross River virus,"This phrase explicitly denotes an antibody directed to Ross River virus, with no mention of Ig class, test result, or procedure. It is a Substance in SNOMED CT. The exact code match is 709967004 Antibody to Ross river virus (substance), since the entry specifies the targeted organism and the antibody substance. Broader parent concepts would lose specificity, while child concepts like IgG/IgM subclasses or assay observables would introduce attributes not stated. 'Antibody to' is clinically equivalent to 'antibody against' and does not change code selection."
422896003,Environment contains mold (finding),Environment contains mold,"The main concept explicitly states that the environment contains mold, which is a presence finding about the patient's surroundings rather than a patient disorder or exposure event. This aligns directly with SNOMED CT 422896003 (Environment contains mold) within the Clinical finding hierarchy. More general parent findings (e.g., environment finding) are less specific, and sibling concepts like exposure to mold or mold allergy are not indicated. The wording is a direct match to the preferred term without introducing timing, severity, location specifics, or associated conditions."
433878006,Planomonospora parontospora (organism),Catalog entry—Planomonospora parontospora,"The wording suggests a catalog context while naming the organism Planomonospora parontospora, keeping the focus on the species taxon. There is no clinical attribute or detection implied, making the precise match the Organism concept SCTID 433878006. Higher-level parents (genus) or other species would be less appropriate, and child strains are not mentioned. The catalog context is descriptive and does not change the code selection for the organism."
259602006,Apolipoprotein C-IV (substance),Component listed: apolipoprotein C-IV,"The term ‘component’ reflects that apolipoprotein C-IV can be an analyte or constituent, but no measurement or presence/absence is asserted. The substance concept is intended, category Substance, code 259602006. Parent concepts (e.g., apolipoprotein) are too general, and other C isoforms are incorrect. The wording keeps the focus on the named substance without changing to an observable entity."
46921009,Quinoline dye (substance),Quinoline-derived dye,"Main concept: quinoline dye. Explicit attributes: “derived” indicates a class relationship to quinoline chemistry but adds no specific identity or usage attribute. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This aligns with SCTID 46921009, the class of dyes derived from quinoline. Broader parents such as “Quinoline (substance)” or general “Dye” would miss the dye subclass, while specific children (individual named quinoline dyes) are not implied here. The wording is a clinically equivalent synonym for the class."
170940000,Shared care: practice nurse and general practitioner (finding),Under shared care of a GP and a practice nurse.,"This phrase denotes the patient’s care arrangement under shared responsibility by a GP and a practice nurse, directly corresponding to SNOMED CT 170940000. The primary concept is a care delivery finding, and no cause, timing, severity, or condition context is added. Category: Clinical finding. Parent concepts (e.g., generic shared care) and siblings (e.g., shared care with a specialist) are excluded by the explicit roles named here, making this code the most precise."
1208791005,No known radon in residence (situation),Charted: no known radon in residence,"This entry frames the information as chart documentation but clearly states no known radon in the residence. The main concept is radon status in the home with negated knowledge. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. SCTID 1208791005 is correct because it represents a documented situation of no known radon in residence, not a test result or generalized exposure. Sibling concepts specifying presence or different environmental contexts would be incorrect. The documentation context does not introduce new attributes or change code selection."
63321003,Entire inner surface of fourth rib (body structure),Whole inner aspect of fourth rib,"The wording 'whole' ensures the entire extent is intended, and 'inner aspect' is equivalent to 'inner surface.' The SNOMED CT category is Body structure. It maps directly to SCTID 63321003 by denoting the entire inner surface of the fourth rib. Broader concepts like 'Fourth rib' or 'Rib inner surface (unspecified rib)' are imprecise, and any lateralized variants would be too specific; thus, this is the most precise fit."
315394002,Born in Burma (finding),Place of birth: Burma (patient-reported).,"This entries indicates the patient's place of birth as Burma, which corresponds to Born in Burma (SCTID 315394002) in the Clinical finding hierarchy. The note 'patient-reported' speaks only to the source of information and does not change the medical concept, so parent concepts like Place of birth (finding) would be less specific, and no child or sibling is more appropriate."
117636007,Cerebroside sulfatase A (substance),Reference substance: arylsulfatase A.,"The entry labels arylsulfatase A as a reference substance, directly identifying the enzyme as the concept. No attributes of measurement, deficiency, or genetics are included. This fits the SNOMED Substance category and aligns with SCTID 117636007. A parent 'arylsulfatase' concept would be too general, and sibling enzymes are distinct. The synonym used remains clinically equivalent, leaving the code unchanged."
8123007,Blood group antibody Schuppenhauer (substance),Inventory item: anti-Schuppenhauer blood group antibody,"The entry lists the Schuppenhauer blood group antibody as an inventory item, which still denotes the substance itself. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. “Anti-Schuppenhauer” is a clinically equivalent synonym of the preferred term, and no detection, titer, or isotype attributes are implied. It is more specific than the parent class of blood group antibodies and does not suggest any sibling antigen targets. Thus, SCTID 8123007 is the correct and most precise match."
16223051000119101,Nasal sinus contents specimen (specimen),Chart lists nasal sinus contents specimen under specimens,"This entry reflects chart documentation indicating a specimen categorized as nasal sinus contents, without procedural or diagnostic qualifiers. The main concept is a specimen of nasal sinus contents; attributes include only body site and contents nature. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen, with the precise code Nasal sinus contents specimen (SCTID 16223051000119101). Parent-level ‘nasal sinus specimen’ is too broad, and siblings such as fluid, swab, tissue, or aspirate are not supported by the wording. The documentation context does not alter the concept."
167025001,Blood oxygen level within reference range (finding),Blood oxygen level in the reference interval,"Saying the blood oxygen level is in the reference interval indicates normality with respect to laboratory or clinical reference standards. Main concept: blood oxygen level; attribute: in reference interval. Category: Clinical finding. This matches Blood oxygen level within reference range (finding) SCTID 167025001 and avoids method-specific or disorder terms. Parent concepts are too vague, and child/sibling concepts that specify saturation or PaO2 are not indicated here."
34758000,Crocodylus niloticus (organism),Catalogue entry — Crocodylus niloticus,"The catalogue entry names Crocodylus niloticus, a specific species. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. No other attributes are introduced, so the organism concept SCTID 34758000 is the correct and most granular match. Broader taxonomic categories would be less precise."
395159008,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease leaflet given (situation),COPD printed handout given,"The entry captures that a printed handout regarding COPD was given. The central concept is provision of a COPD leaflet, with no added details about timing or other education components. In SNOMED CT, this is a Situation, and the appropriate code is “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease leaflet given (situation)” (395159008). “Printed handout” is synonymous with a leaflet in clinical documentation. Parent concepts would be too general, and siblings like education session or counseling introduce a different type of activity not present here."
82991000119104,History of negative cervical Papanicolaou smear performed within last 12 months (situation),Problem list: history of negative cervical Pap in last 12 months,"The problem list item explicitly records a history of a negative cervical Pap within the last 12 months, making it a historical situation with a defined timeframe. It belongs to Situation with explicit context and maps to SCTID 82991000119104. Parent concepts omitting the timeframe or the negative result are less specific, and sibling concepts denoting a current test outcome do not reflect the historical nature. The phrase 'cervical Pap' is synonymous with 'cervical Papanicolaou smear' without altering meaning."
116085009,Product containing retinoid (product),Pharmaceutical class entry: retinoid-containing medicinal product,"This entry labels a pharmaceutical class item that is a medicinal product containing retinoid, with no further specifics about formulation or the particular retinoid. It aligns with the Product hierarchy. SCTID 116085009 Product containing retinoid (product) is the appropriate code because the description is ingredient-based at the product level. Broader classes like general medicinal product or substance-level retinoid are incorrect, and narrower items naming a specific retinoid or route/dose are not supported by the text. The synonymic wording maintains the same concept without adding attributes."
25931000,Nitrosamine (substance),Nitrosamine molecule,"Labeling nitrosamine as a molecule still points to the chemical substance class without introducing any additional attributes or specific members. SNOMED CT category: Substance. This matches Nitrosamine (substance) SCTID 25931000. Using a broader parent (e.g., organic molecule) would be too general, and child concepts (individual nitrosamines) are not indicated."
404310008,Salmonella group O:21 (organism),Microorganism — Salmonella group O:21,"The entry identifies the microorganism and names the exact Salmonella serogroup O:21, with no clinical qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The correct mapping is Salmonella group O:21 (organism), SCTID 404310008. Using a parent organism category would be too broad, and choosing another serogroup or a disorder concept (e.g., infection) would not align with the wording. The descriptor 'Microorganism' is a neutral context indicator and does not change the taxonomic concept."
389109008,Group (social concept),Group tag,"“Group tag” references the tagging or label of a social group, maintaining neutrality about subtype, size, or membership. The main concept is an abstract social grouping without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Social concept and the appropriate code is Group (social concept) [389109008]. Choosing child or sibling concepts (e.g., ethnic group, patient group) would add specificity not present. The use of “tag” is administrative framing only and leaves the concept unchanged."
874875003,Protein and/or protein derivative intake (observable entity),Intake measure: protein and/or protein derivative intake,"The phrase identifies the measured intake parameter as protein and/or protein derivatives, consistent with an observable entity capturing ingestion. Category: Observable entity. It maps to SCTID 874875003 because it explicitly includes both protein and derivatives and avoids specifying amounts or abnormality. Parent observables such as general dietary intake are too broad, while narrower concepts confined to protein intake or derivative-only intake would be incomplete. The wording is a clinical synonym of the preferred concept."
223877005,East Sussex (geographic location),"East Sussex, Great Britain","The entry specifies East Sussex and places it within Great Britain for context, but the codable concept remains the county East Sussex. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. SCTID 223877005 is exact; mapping to Great Britain or England would lose specificity, and mapping to municipal areas within East Sussex would be too granular. The added regional context does not change the concept."
142006001,"Entire skeletal muscle of tongue, palate, pharynx AND/OR nose (body structure)","Muscle anatomy (head/neck subset): tongue, palate, pharynx, and nose skeletal muscles","This entry defines a subset of head/neck muscle anatomy limited to the tongue, palate, pharynx, and nose skeletal muscles, exactly the aggregate represented by SCTID 142006001 (Body structure). It avoids extra attributes. A parent like 'muscle of head and neck' is too broad, whereas any single-region muscle concept is too narrow. The wording offers context without altering the anatomical boundaries."
711453007,Failed procedure using minimal access approach (situation),Clinician note: minimal access approach procedure recorded as failed.,"The clinician documentation specifies a procedure done using a minimal access approach and confirms it was failed. Category: Situation. This exactly matches the concept 711453007. It is more precise than 'Failed procedure' due to approach specification and avoids child concepts by not naming particular modalities like laparoscopy. No additional attributes such as cause, site, or conversion are introduced."
82460002,Incision of thyroid (procedure),Thyroid incision,"The wording indicates a surgical incision involving the thyroid, with no mention of removal, drainage, biopsy, or other actions. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. The best match is 82460002 Incision of thyroid because it captures the act of cutting into the thyroid gland. A more general parent like Procedure on thyroid is less precise, and sibling procedures such as thyroidectomy or biopsy would misrepresent the action. This is a safe synonym that keeps the same meaning as the preferred term."
217246000,Burning caused by conflagration in boarding house (event),Burning associated with a lodging house conflagration,"This entry specifies burning linked to a conflagration in a lodging house, with 'lodging house' being a clinically equivalent term for boarding house. It describes an Event external cause without adding severity or timing. A generic parent like 'Burning caused by conflagration' misses the lodging-house location detail, while siblings for other buildings are not applicable."
386746003,Maintenance - action (qualifier value),Report action field: maintenance,"The phrase indicates the action field in a report is populated with “maintenance,” which is the SNOMED CT action qualifier value. As a Qualifier value, 386746003 is the precise representation of “Maintenance - action.” No target or other qualifiers are present, so parent or sibling actions are less appropriate. The reporting context does not alter the action semantics; it simply states the specific action selected."
1269132005,Lisinopril anhydrous (substance),Lisinopril anhydrous API,"API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) here names the same chemical substance in its anhydrous form, a Substance concept. It correctly maps to Lisinopril anhydrous (substance) and avoids implying a medicinal product or a hydrated variant. Parent lisinopril (substance) is less specific, and sibling hydrate/product concepts do not match the stated anhydrous API."
700612006,"Wound hydrogel dressing, sterile (physical object)",Sterile hydrogel dressing for wound care,"The entry denotes a hydrogel dressing that is sterile and is intended for wound care, which is inherent to the product class and maps to 'Wound hydrogel dressing, sterile' (SCTID: 700612006). Main concept: sterile hydrogel dressing used as a wound dressing; attribute: sterility. Category: Physical object. The phrasing 'for wound care' describes the intended use of a wound dressing without adding new clinical context, keeping the mapping to the specific product. Parent concepts such as generic sterile wound dressings are too broad, and siblings like silver-impregnated hydrogel dressings would introduce extra attributes that are not stated here."
703854006,Narrative comment section of imaging report (record artifact),Imaging report comment section – narrative text,"The entry points to the comment section of an imaging report and clarifies that its content is narrative text, reflecting the structural part of the report. This aligns with the Record artifact category. SCTID 703854006 exactly captures the narrative comment section of an imaging report. Alternatives like impressions or findings sections are not mentioned and would be incorrect mappings. The use of 'narrative text' is a clinically acceptable synonym for narrative comments and does not introduce additional attributes."
160292002,Family history of leukemia (situation),H&P: family history—leukemia.,"In the history and physical, leukemia is noted under family history, with no mention of subtype or relative. The SNOMED CT category is Situation. This matches Family history of leukemia (SCTID 160292002). Selecting a parent like Family history of malignant neoplasm would be too broad, and selecting a child concept such as Family history of acute leukemia would be too specific. The shorthand formatting is a synonymous representation of the concept."
399026003,Zanelli projection (qualifier value),Checklist item: Zanelli projection,"This entry names a checklist item as the Zanelli projection, identifying the projection technique qualifier. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. It precisely maps to SCTID 399026003. No extra attributes are present. Broader parent concepts or other named projection siblings would not be as accurate given the explicit Zanelli label."
53519006,Dichlorotetrafluoromethane (substance),Dichloro-tetrafluoromethane,"This entry uses a minor hyphenation variant of the same chemical name, still denoting the identical substance without introducing any additional attributes. The main concept remains a single chemical compound; category: Substance. The hyphenation does not alter meaning and is clinically equivalent, so 53519006 is the precise code. Parent classes (e.g., chlorofluoromethanes) would be too broad, and siblings (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane) are different compounds; therefore, this exact substance concept is most appropriate."
12185006,Brassica alba (organism),Brassica alba organism reference,"This entry references the organism Brassica alba, clearly denoting the species-level taxon. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It matches the exact concept and does not introduce broader parents or different species siblings. The term 'reference' is contextual and does not alter the semantic target; it remains a direct mention of the organism, justifying the Brassica alba (organism) code."
57931000052101,Combined cervical mucus and urine specimen (specimen),Composite specimen—cervical mucus with urine,"Using “composite specimen” communicates a single specimen formed from more than one material, here explicitly cervical mucus and urine. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. It best maps to Combined cervical mucus and urine specimen (SCTID: 57931000052101) because the two sources are specified and are combined. A general composite or combined specimen without source detail would be overly broad, and individual cervical mucus or urine specimen concepts would be incomplete. The synonym “composite” is clinically equivalent to “combined” for specimen description."
394713005,Urine leukocyte test two plus (finding),Leukocyte reagent pad reading two plus (urine),"Referring to the leukocyte reagent pad reading two plus on a urine dipstick directly expresses the dipstick leukocyte esterase graded value. This aligns with the Clinical finding ‘Urine leukocyte test two plus’ (394713005). It is not merely positive nor does it select a different grade, and it avoids adding method variations beyond the standard dipstick context, ensuring precise mapping."
183026009,Hyperalimentation (product),Label identifies: hyperalimentation product,"A labeling context references the product’s designation without implying route, dose, or administration. SNOMED CT category: Product. This aligns with Hyperalimentation (product) [183026009], and does not more accurately map to any specific formulation or procedure. Sibling concepts requiring specifics like enteral or parenteral usage are not implicated. The synonymic phrasing preserves the product concept."
50543005,Thought insertion (finding),Chart note: thought insertion symptom.,"This phrasing records a symptom consistent with thought insertion, clearly indicating the insertion of thoughts into the mind. It represents a Clinical finding and corresponds to SCTID 50543005. Broader or alternative phenomena are excluded by the explicit insertion terminology."
420592002,Pressure injury stage (observable entity),Stage of pressure ulcer,"The entry denotes the staging attribute specific to a pressure ulcer, which is equivalent to pressure injury staging. It is an Observable entity and maps most precisely to SNOMED CT 420592002. Broader parent observables like ulcer stage in general do not capture the pressure etiology, and specific child stages would incorrectly imply a value that is not stated. The wording remains limited to the staging observable without additional qualifiers."
728806006,Entire rectal artery (body structure),Full rectal artery,"Here 'full' is used as a synonym for 'entire,' indicating the complete rectal artery with no restriction to a part or branch. The concept is a Body structure and aligns with SNOMED CT Entire rectal artery (SCTID: 728806006). It does not introduce attributes like disease, procedure, or branch specification, keeping it distinct from child concepts such as superior/middle/inferior rectal artery. The parent 'structure of rectal artery' lacks the completeness implied here, making the 'entire' concept the best fit."
285121003,Toxic environment (environment),Toxic environment noted in report,"This states that a report notes an environment as toxic, adding only documentation context and no agent, exposure, or patient outcomes. The SNOMED CT category is Environment. It aligns with 285121003 Toxic environment (environment) because the central concept is the environmental toxicity. Parent concepts without toxicity are inadequate, and child concepts requiring specific toxins or contexts are not indicated. The reporting context does not change the environmental classification."
176980004,Endoscopic bilateral ringing of fallopian tubes (procedure),Laparoscopic bilateral fallopian tube ring application,"This describes placement of rings on both fallopian tubes via laparoscopy, which is an endoscopic approach. It is a Procedure. Laparoscopic is a clinically standard synonym for endoscopic in this context, and 'fallopian tube ring application' is semantically equivalent to 'ringing of fallopian tubes.' The specificity to bilateral and ring method matches SCTID 176980004. Concepts like generic tubal ligation or clip application would be less appropriate because they omit the ring method."
112544006,Varanus bengalensis (organism),Record lists: Varanus bengalensis,The concept present is the organism Varanus bengalensis being listed in a record. SNOMED CT category: Organism. Listing context does not add attributes like exposure or injury; the species name is the core data element. The species-level organism concept (112544006) remains the most accurate mapping.
223602002,Nepal (geographic location),Nepal noted in history,"The content notes Nepal within a history section; this is contextual placement and the concept itself remains the geographic location of Nepal. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location (Location). The most precise code is 223602002. The phrase does not introduce historical events like travel or immigration; it avoids parent regions and child locales, ensuring unique mapping to the country Nepal."
890446001,Brevibacterium samyangense (organism),Microbiology: Brevibacterium samyangense,"Within a microbiology context, naming Brevibacterium samyangense alone denotes the organism identity, matching SNOMED CT 890446001 (Organism). The entry does not state detection findings, clinical condition, site, or strain, so a finding/disorder code or a different taxon level would be inappropriate. The exact species name rules out parent genus and sibling species."
301801008,Finding of position of pregnancy (finding),Clinical finding: position of pregnancy,"The entry explicitly frames the position of pregnancy as a clinical finding, which matches the SNOMED CT concept category. The main concept is the pregnancy’s positional aspect, making SCTID 301801008 the precise match. It does not include fetal presentation, placental site, or uterine orientation, which would shift coding to other concepts. The phrase is a clear, semantically equivalent representation of the target finding without additional attributes."
444487004,Exposure to anogenital Herpes simplex virus (event),Intake note: exposure to anogenital herpes simplex virus,"The text records, in intake context, an exposure event to HSV involving the anogenital region. Contextual words like 'intake note' do not introduce clinical attributes beyond exposure. This is an Event and maps to SNOMED CT code 444487004. Broader exposure-to-HSV concepts are underspecified, and infection diagnoses are incorrect because no disease is stated. No timing, severity, laterality, or type is added."
46399008,Salmonella Apapa (organism),Salmonella Apapa noted by microbiology,"The entry indicates that microbiology noted the organism Salmonella Apapa, keeping focus on the organism name. This maps to the Organism hierarchy with SCTID 46399008. It does not detail clinical disease, site, or severity, so disorder or finding concepts are not preferred. The exact serovar is referenced, ruling out parent or sibling organism concepts."
371536005,Flow sheet report (record artifact),Flowsheet report generated,"The phrase indicates generation of a flowsheet report without changing its type or adding content-specific attributes. It maps to Flow sheet report (record artifact), SCTID 371536005. Parent categories are overly general, and child/sibling concepts implying a particular clinical domain or subtype would be inappropriate because such attributes are not present."
169953009,Placenta weight (observable entity),Placental weight referenced,"The wording shows that the placental weight attribute is referenced, focusing on the observable property and not on measurement actions or numerical results. The concept is an Observable entity. SCTID 169953009 is the exact mapping for this attribute. Parent-level observables would lack specificity, and sibling properties like placental size or thickness indicate different measurements. ‘Referenced’ is documentation context and does not change the target concept."
1141633005,Scissor-like soft tissue surgical forceps (physical object),Scissor-like surgical forceps for soft tissue,"The phrase clearly states scissor-like surgical forceps intended for soft tissue, which is a Physical object matching SCTID 1141633005. More general parents would lack the scissor-like attribute, and related instruments such as scissors or clamps are not the same device class. It introduces no additional qualifiers (e.g., toothed, locking) that would suggest a child or sibling concept."
48353002,Nursery gown technique (procedure),Observed nursery gown technique per unit policy,"The entry indicates observation of the nursery gown technique consistent with unit policy, still describing the same procedural technique in the nursery setting. Category: Procedure. Referencing policy does not change the clinical meaning; it confirms the specific gown technique rather than any other infection control measure. It avoids parent-level generalities and does not suggest sibling procedures (e.g., mask technique), thus fitting Nursery gown technique (48353002)."
130026009,Peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase (substance),Peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase protein,"Describing it as a protein reinforces its biochemical nature, but the core identity remains peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase. It is appropriately coded as a Substance. Broader parent classes (protein, enzyme) would be less precise, while sibling entities (e.g., other peptide-modifying dioxygenases) would misrepresent the target. No attributes such as source, isoform, or measurement are added, so SCTID 130026009 is the most accurate selection."
69552008,Accelerated particle (physical force),Accelerated particle documented,A documentation-style phrasing that retains focus on the physical force of an accelerated particle without extra qualifiers. The SNOMED category is Physical force. It maps to Accelerated particle (69552008) rather than parent or sibling concepts due to the explicit reference to a particle that is accelerated. The word “documented” provides context only and does not introduce new attributes.
789393001,Estimated oral intake of liquid meal replacement in 24 hours (observable entity),Estimated amount taken orally of liquid meal replacement in 24 hours,"Main concept: an estimated amount of liquid meal replacement taken orally during 24 hours. Attributes: estimate, oral route, liquid meal replacement, 24-hour interval. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. SCTID 789393001 is the most appropriate code, capturing an estimated oral intake of a liquid meal replacement in 24 hours. Parent or sibling codes that generalize the substance, change the route, or convert to measured intake are less suitable. 'Amount taken orally' is synonymous with 'oral intake' and does not change the selection."
223727004,Part of African country (geographic location),Area inside an African country (not the whole country),"This entry highlights that the location is an area inside an African country and explicitly clarifies it is not the entire country, reinforcing the subnational scope. SNOMED CT category: Geographic location. Code 223727004 appropriately represents a part of an African country. A parent like Part of country does not reflect the Africa constraint, and a child like Part of Cameroon or City in African country would be too specific. The phrasing is a clear paraphrase of the concept, with the parenthetical clarification not introducing any additional attributes beyond confirming 'part.'"
1179644005,Residential home for disabled people (environment),Residence type: residential home for disabled people,"This phrasing documents the type of residence and identifies it as a residential home for disabled people. The main concept remains the environment/place without added attributes like timing or level of care. In SNOMED CT terms, this maps to the Environment or geographical location hierarchy. SCTID 1179644005 is the best match because it specifies the exact residential setting for disabled people. A parent concept like “residential facility” would be too broad, and siblings like “assisted living” or “nursing home” introduce different care models, which are not stated here. The term is a paraphrase that preserves the same meaning and scope as the preferred concept."
46851004,Contact with plants (event),Contact with plants,"Main concept: contact with plants. No additional attributes (no cause, outcome, timing, location, laterality, or severity) are introduced. SNOMED CT category: Event. The phrase exactly matches the preferred term for SCTID 46851004 and represents a generic event of coming into contact with plant matter. More general parents like unspecified environmental contact would be too broad, and children or siblings like contact with poisonous plants, plant thorns, or allergic plant exposure would be too specific and add attributes not stated. Therefore, 46851004 is the most precise match."
230940006,Insertion of intracranial pressure catheter (procedure),Neurosurgical insertion of intracranial pressure catheter,"This wording frames the procedure in a neurosurgical context but the core concept remains insertion of an intracranial pressure catheter. No extra attributes such as location, drainage, or approach are introduced. Category: Procedure. It aligns with SNOMED CT 230940006 as it specifies catheter insertion for ICP monitoring. The mention of 'neurosurgical' is contextual about the service line and does not change the procedural concept. Sibling procedures like bolt placement or EVD are not indicated, and child concepts specifying ventricular or parenchymal placement are not invoked."
718347000,Mental health care plan (record artifact),Patient reports a mental health care plan,"The concept referenced is the presence of a mental health care plan as a record artifact, expressed from a patient-reported perspective. SNOMED CT’s Record artifact Mental health care plan (record artifact) 718347000 is the best fit. The patient-reporting context does not change the artifact itself or add attributes like timing or associated diagnoses. Mapping to a generic care plan would be too broad, and selecting condition-specific or discipline-specific plans would be unwarranted. Therefore, 718347000 is the precise code."
279119006,Fearful (qualifier value),"Patient self-description: ""fearful""","The term 'fearful' is captured as the patient's own descriptor, serving as a qualitative label rather than a clinical diagnosis. This aligns with the SNOMED CT Qualifier value category, matching Fearful (qualifier value) [279119006]. Selecting 'Fear (finding)' would imply an asserted symptom, which the entry does not explicitly claim; it records a value term. No additional attributes—severity, cause, timing—are introduced."
225762007,At the end of the day (qualifier value),At the day's end,"This is a grammatical variant of the same temporal qualifier, 'at the day's end,' which denotes the specific end boundary of the day. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. It should not map to broader parents (e.g., generic temporal qualifiers) or to siblings like 'night' or 'twilight' that imply different periods. The phrasing remains strictly a time qualifier and does not add any clinical details, making the given concept the most precise match."
404310008,Salmonella group O:21 (organism),Salmonella O:21 (serogroup),"The entry identifies the organism by its O-antigen group and clarifies the taxonomic level by appending '(serogroup)', with no clinical qualifiers. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The precise SNOMED CT concept is Salmonella group O:21 (organism), SCTID 404310008. Using a parent or generic Salmonella code would lose the O:21 specificity, and naming any specific serovar would be more detailed than the text provides. The parenthetical note simply clarifies the taxonomy and is a clinically safe synonym without introducing new attributes."
468421000,Anchored bone-conduction hearing aid (physical object),Bone-anchored hearing device (aid),"The phrase denotes a hearing device that is bone-anchored, with ‘aid’ clarifying it is a hearing aid, pointing to the physical object. The main concept is the anchored bone-conduction hearing aid; no presence or laterality attributes are included. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. SCTID 468421000 fits best because it specifically encodes anchored bone-conduction hearing aids. A more general hearing aid concept would be insufficiently specific, and sibling concepts like softband bone-conduction aids or air-conduction aids are inappropriate. The device/aide synonymy is clinically standard."
261961000,Mus 127 (qualifier value),Status set to Mus 127,"The phrase indicates that the status field holds 'Mus 127', but the conveyed concept is still the Qualifier value SCTID 261961000. It introduces no additional attributes beyond the value itself and does not imply change or severity. This maps exactly to 'Mus 127 (qualifier value)' rather than a general status or parent qualifier. The context word 'status' does not alter the meaning of the recorded value."
349846008,Product containing antifolate (product),EMR medication field: antifolate pharmaceutical product,This denotes an electronic medical record field specifying an antifolate pharmaceutical product. The category is Pharmaceutical/biologic product. It best matches SNOMED CT 349846008 since it identifies the product and antifolate ingredient class without additional qualifiers. The EMR field context is administrative and does not alter coding granularity; parent concepts are too generic and child concepts are over-specific for this wording.
184881005,Disabled registration application - minimal report (record artifact),Disabled registration application minimal report record,"The phrase denotes a recorded minimal report associated with a disabled registration application, which is a record artifact. The category is Record artifact. SCTID 184881005 is the precise code because the entry captures the exact artifact type and application context. Parent concepts such as general records or reports lack the specific qualifier, while siblings indicating different artifacts (form, certificate, template) do not match a report. The use of “record” here is a generic descriptor consistent with record artifacts."
11997009,Structure of capsule of joint of pisiform bone (body structure),Pisiform joint capsular tissue,"The phrase designates the capsular tissue of the joint involving the pisiform bone, which corresponds to the pisotriquetral joint capsule. This is a Body structure in SNOMED CT. It does not suggest injury, inflammation, or laterality; it is solely an anatomical reference. Mapping to the joint or bone alone would miss the capsule specificity, and broader capsule concepts would be too general. “Capsular tissue” is synonymous with the capsule structure, making 11997009 the best fit."
309077009,Spleen resection specimen (specimen),Accessioned specimen: spleen resection,"The laboratory accession references a spleen resection specimen. Concepts: specimen accession; attributes: spleen source, resection acquisition. SNOMED CT category: Specimen. This maps to Spleen resection specimen (specimen), SCTID 309077009. A general 'spleen specimen' would not indicate resection, and child/sibling concepts like 'biopsy specimen' or 'aspirate specimen' are not supported by the wording. No extra attributes such as extent or processing are introduced."
736111005,Hospital bed enclosure frame (physical object),Hospital bed enclosure frame assembly,"The term 'assembly' here refers to the frame assembly that makes up the enclosure framework around a hospital bed, which still denotes the same physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. It remains specific to the frame component and not the entire enclosure or other bed structures. Parent categories or sibling devices (rails, traction frames) would not be as precise. The synonym does not change the code selection."
162980001,Cardiovascular system not examined (situation),CV system exam not done,"The abbreviation ‘CV’ for cardiovascular is standard, and the phrase asserts non-performance of the exam. No additional attributes are present. This is a Situation with explicit context about examination status. SCTID 162980001 maps precisely because it targets the cardiovascular system specifically. Using parent concepts such as ‘Physical examination not done’ would lose specificity, while children like specific maneuvers (e.g., auscultation not done) would be too narrow. The abbreviation does not change clinical meaning and remains equivalent to the preferred term."
275911004,Family history: Angina at greater than 60 years (situation),"Family history of angina pectoris, onset >60","Angina pectoris is a clinically equivalent synonym for angina and the entry specifies that it is in the family history and began at an age greater than 60. This matches SNOMED CT 275911004 (Situation with explicit context). Using 'angina pectoris' does not change coding because it refers to the same disorder. A general family history of angina without age would be less specific, and any mention of specific relatives or earlier ages would misalign with this concept."
258937001,Millimole/gram dry weight tissue (qualifier value),Calibration uses mmol per gram dry weight tissue,"This statement indicates calibration uses the unit mmol per gram dry weight tissue, i.e., millimole per gram dry tissue. The primary concept is a unit of measure Qualifier value. It maps exactly to the specified concept and is more precise than generic mmol per gram without the dry tissue context. Sibling units like mmol per gram wet weight tissue or micromole per gram dry weight tissue are different and not supported by the text. The calibration context does not change the unit being represented."
88331000,Autoimmune reaction mediated by T cells (finding),History: T-cell–driven autoimmune reaction,"As part of the history, this records a T-cell driven autoimmune reaction, with driven being clinically synonymous with mediated. It is a Clinical finding and maps exactly to Autoimmune reaction mediated by T cells (SCTID: 88331000). The history context adds no clinical attributes. Parent concepts are too broad without mediator specification, and antibody-mediated or organ-specific siblings are not supported by the wording."
126175007,Product containing anabolic steroid (product),Documentation notes a product containing anabolic steroid,"Clinical documentation context is given, yet the concept is a medicinal product that contains an anabolic steroid. Category: Product. This precisely corresponds to Product containing anabolic steroid (126175007). No attributes like specific active ingredient, strength, dosage form, or route are added, avoiding child mappings. It does not reflect administration or diagnosis, so findings or procedures are not applicable. Parent concepts are insufficiently specific, and sibling classes (e.g., corticosteroid products) are inconsistent with the stated anabolic steroid."
216043009,"Explosion on aircraft while in transit, occupant of spacecraft injured (event)",In-flight explosion on aircraft resulting in injury to spacecraft occupant,"The concept is an explosion on an aircraft during flight, resulting in injury to a spacecraft occupant. Category: Event. This exactly matches SCTID 216043009, including mechanism, setting, transit state, and victim role. More general or alternate external cause concepts would omit or alter these aspects (e.g., aircraft occupant victim or explosion on spacecraft). ‘Resulting in injury’ is equivalent to ‘injured’ and does not introduce severity or outcomes beyond the injury."
16216821000119102,Past pregnancy history of molar pregnancy (situation),Prenatal intake: pregnancy history of molar pregnancy documented.,"In a prenatal intake context, noting a molar pregnancy within pregnancy history establishes a past obstetric event. That matches the Situation with explicit context concept 'Past pregnancy history of molar pregnancy.' It does not imply a current molar pregnancy, nor does it introduce subtyping or associated management, avoiding child or disorder concepts. The phrasing is more specific than the parent history category and distinct from sibling entries concerning other prior pregnancy complications."
1077601000112103,Escherichia coli serotype O180:H10 (organism),Bacterium recorded: Escherichia coli serotype O180:H10,"The entry indicates a recorded bacterium and names it as Escherichia coli serotype O180:H10, with no mention of disease, site, or test status. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The best match is Escherichia coli serotype O180:H10 (1077601000112103). Parent-level Escherichia coli lacks serotype detail, and any sibling serotype differs from O180:H10. Using 'bacterium' as a descriptor is consistent with the organism concept and does not change code selection."
80678006,Closed reduction of fracture of alveolar process of maxilla (procedure),Closed reduction carried out for fracture of the maxillary alveolar process,"The wording confirms that a closed reduction was performed for a fracture in the maxillary alveolar process. Category: Procedure. This directly corresponds to the concept’s scope, distinguishing it from general maxillary fracture reductions and from open reduction techniques. It introduces no additional attributes beyond method and site."
29011006,Manganese trioxide (substance),Inventory item: Mn2O3,"This identifies Mn2O3 as an inventory item, which is the substance manganese trioxide (manganese(III) oxide). The entry remains a pure substance reference without attributes like dose, mixture, or hazard. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance concept, and SCTID 29011006 corresponds exactly to Mn2O3. A parent class such as general manganese oxides would be nonspecific, and sibling oxides with different compositions would be incorrect for this entry."
91185004,Active C1q (substance),"Complement C1q, active form","This is a clear synonym identifying the active form of C1q within the complement system. There are no added clinical attributes or observables. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It matches 91185004 precisely, avoiding misclassification to general C1q (non-specified state) or to observables such as 'C1q level'—the wording focuses solely on the substance in its active form."
62849006,Gliricolla (organism),Organism: Gliricolla,"The entry explicitly names the organism Gliricolla in a neutral labeling format. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. It maps precisely to SCTID 62849006, reflecting the genus without asserting presence, infection, or any other attribute. Parent concepts (broader lice/insect categories) and child species are not indicated. The prefix 'Organism:' is a contextual label that retains the same organism concept."
223775009,Australian Capital Territory (geographic location),Geographic location: Australian Capital Territory,"The entry directly classifies Australian Capital Territory as the geographic location, which aligns with the SNOMED CT category Location—Geographic location. SCTID 223775009 precisely denotes Australian Capital Territory. Using a generic heading does not change the underlying concept; it avoids parent concepts like Australia and excludes child or sibling regions, ensuring the correct granularity. No additional clinical attributes are included, maintaining unambiguous mapping to the specified territory."
257885003,Occlusion - action (qualifier value),Operative technique: occlusion (action),"The entry defines “occlusion” as the operative technique and labels it as an action, aligning with a method qualifier value. SNOMED CT category: Qualifier value. No anatomical site, device, or timing is introduced. Occlusion - action (257885003) is the best code because it precisely represents the technique; the parent “Action” is too generic, and alternative sibling methods (e.g., “ligation,” “embolization,” “closure”) would be inaccurate. The wording avoids implying a clinical occlusion state, so it should not map to disorder/finding concepts."
396355000,Specimen from skin obtained by excision (specimen),Excisional skin specimen,"This entry states a skin specimen obtained via excisional technique. It is a Specimen concept, matching SCTID 396355000 by specifying skin as the origin and excision as the method. It does not add attributes such as lesion type, margins, or laterality. Parent terms without method are too broad, and alternatives like punch or shave biopsy would be incorrect given the explicit “excisional” wording. “Excisional” is a clinically equivalent synonym for obtained by excision and does not change the intended code."
412369009,Drug propellant (product),Clinician documentation: drug propellant,"The clinician documentation entry identifies “drug propellant,” referring to the medicinal product used as a propellant. This is a Pharmaceutical/biologic product (Product). The context does not alter the underlying concept, and no specific chemical, route, or associated condition is introduced. Broader parents or sibling excipient concepts would be less precise, so SCTID 412369009 is appropriate."
385829003,Specimen care assessment (procedure),Specimen care review performed,"This indicates that a review of specimen care took place, which is a procedural assessment of handling practices for the specimen. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. “Review” functions as a synonym for assessment here and thus maps to Specimen care assessment (procedure) SCTID 385829003. No new attributes (e.g., outcomes or specific preanalytical steps) are added, so other codes such as specimen adequacy assessment or labeling check are not warranted."
399633004,Specimen from thymus gland obtained by biopsy (specimen),Patient statement: biopsy sample taken from my thymus,"In a patient-reported context, the core concept remains a specimen from the thymus obtained via biopsy. The elements are specimen (sample), source (thymus), and method (biopsy). The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. This aligns with 399633004, as it conveys the exact specimen type. It does not imply a particular biopsy technique or processing that would push it to a child concept, nor does it generalize away the method as a parent would. The phrasing is a lay synonym that preserves the same coded meaning."
115501000,"Acid phosphatase, non-prostatic fraction (substance)",Non-prostatic portion of acid phosphatase,"The word 'portion' functions as a synonym of 'fraction,' describing the acid phosphatase part that is non-prostatic, which matches SNOMED CT substance 115501000. The main concept is an enzyme fraction excluding prostatic origin; no measurement or clinical finding context is implied. Category: Substance. The parent concept would be too general (all fractions), and the prostatic fraction sibling is inconsistent with the wording. The paraphrase remains clinically equivalent, supporting the same substance code."
223735001,Part of Asian country (geographic location),Place within an Asian country's borders,"This entry describes a place situated within the borders of an Asian country, without indicating its administrative designation or identity. It is a Geographic location concept. SCTID 223735001 “Part of Asian country (geographic location)” is the correct selection because it refers to an unspecified intra-country area in Asia. Choosing the entire country as a parent concept would misrepresent the scope, and any child that specifies city/province/district would exceed the information provided. The phrase is a clear paraphrase of “part of Asian country” with equivalent meaning."
44544003,Structure of lateral rectus capitis muscle (body structure),Surgical approach bounded by the rectus capitis lateralis muscle,"The entry references the muscle as a boundary in a surgical approach, which remains an anatomical structure designation with no added pathology or laterality. The category is Body structure, and the accurate code is Structure of lateral rectus capitis muscle (44544003). A parent concept would be too general, and sibling muscles (rectus capitis anterior, obliquus capitis) do not match the lateralis specification."
68973008,Repair of cranial meningocele (procedure),Procedure: repair of cranial meningocele,"Prefacing with “Procedure:” reflects documentation style without changing the clinical meaning. It denotes repair of a cranial meningocele, a Procedure category concept. SNOMED CT 68973008 is the precise match because the described procedure is specific to the cranial site. Using a parent concept would omit the site, and siblings such as repair of encephalocele or spinal meningocele would be incorrect. The contextual label does not introduce timing or other attributes."
551000220107,Gynecology discharge summary (record artifact),Gynecology discharge summary entry,"This entry denotes an entry in the medical record that is the gynecology discharge summary, without adding timing, status, or other attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. It maps best to Gynecology discharge summary (record artifact), SCTID 551000220107. The word 'entry' is a neutral synonym for an artifact instance in documentation. The generic parent omits specialty detail, and sibling specialty summaries would not match the specified gynecology context."
297330003,Buryat language (qualifier value),Буряад хэлэн,"Using a capitalized variant of the Buryat term for “Buryat language,” the entry represents the same qualifier value without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Qualifier value. Parent or sibling concepts would be less appropriate because the wording precisely designates Buryat. The capitalization does not affect semantic equivalence; it remains a direct match to 297330003."
472901003,Swab from nasal sinus (specimen),Sinus (nasal) swab specimen,"The entry clarifies the swab specimen is from the nasal sinus, using a parenthetical to specify the sinus as nasal. This is a Specimen category concept and correctly maps to Swab from nasal sinus (specimen) SCTID 472901003. It does not default to a generic sinus or another respiratory site, nor does it imply a different collection technique. The synonymic structure is clinically equivalent and does not alter the concept choice."
309476009,Neck block dissection specimen (specimen),Gross: neck block dissection specimen,"In a gross pathology report context, this identifies the specimen type as a neck block dissection specimen. The main concept is the specimen; the site and procurement method are explicitly stated. It maps to the SNOMED CT Specimen category, SCTID 309476009. A broader gross entry like ‘neck specimen’ would not specify block dissection, and a different dissection approach would be a sibling. The ‘gross’ context does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
90594009,Elaeodendron (organism),Genus: Elaeodendron,"This entry explicitly indicates the taxonomic rank (genus) and names Elaeodendron, pointing directly to the organism at the genus level. SNOMED CT category: Organism. The exact fit is 90594009 Elaeodendron (organism), because the wording does not specify any species or introduce broader taxa. Parent concepts (e.g., Celastraceae or plants) are too broad, and child concepts (specific Elaeodendron species) are not mentioned. The phrase is a precise synonym that does not add clinical attributes."
272350004,Dyna - Dental precision attachment (physical object),Dyna dental precision attachment,"The main concept is a Dyna dental precision attachment, explicitly naming the Dyna variant of a precision attachment used in dentistry. This is a Physical object in SNOMED CT. The wording directly matches the specific device concept rather than a generic or related finding, so the most precise code is the Dyna − Dental precision attachment. Using a broader parent such as Dental precision attachment would lose the brand/type specificity, and children or siblings (e.g., other brands or specific components like male/female parts) are not stated."
284776009,Does perform personal care activity (finding),Follow-up: personal care is performed.,"In a follow-up context, stating that personal care is performed corresponds to 'Does perform personal care activity.' No timing beyond the general context is asserted and no assistance or independence details are given. SNOMED CT category: Clinical finding. The statement targets personal care overall, not all ADLs or specific components, and it denotes performance rather than ability, making the provided SCTID the most accurate mapping."
830149003,Clinical neurophysiology service (qualifier value),Clinical neurophysiology service header,"Document headers often label the involved service; ‘service header’ here still denotes the service type as clinical neurophysiology. Category is Qualifier value. No extra attributes like referral or appointment are present, preventing drift to procedural or encounter codes. It is specific and more appropriate than the generic parent service."
245599001,Entire permanent mandibular right lateral incisor tooth (body structure),Palmer LR 2 (permanent lower right lateral incisor tooth),"In Palmer notation, the number 2 in the lower right quadrant denotes the permanent lateral incisor; the entry clarifies the permanent dentition and entire tooth. Main concept: entire permanent mandibular right lateral incisor tooth. SNOMED CT category: Body structure. SCTID 245599001 is the precise match; primary Palmer notation uses letters, not numbers, thus permanent status is clear. Parent/part-level structures are less precise, and sibling teeth (e.g., LR 1 central incisor) do not match the lateral incisor designation."
223622003,Fiji (geographic location),Fiji — country label,"‘Country label’ indicates that Fiji is being named as a country, preserving the geographic location identity. In SNOMED CT, this aligns with Fiji (geographic location), SCTID 223622003, under the Location hierarchy. There are no appended attributes (e.g., residence, birthplace). Parent concepts (e.g., continent or region) or children (regional divisions) are not suggested."
226828009,Edam cheese (substance),Edam cheese listed in history,"The entry shows Edam cheese appearing within a history context, but the referent remains the food substance alone. In SNOMED CT, this is a Substance, with the correct code Edam cheese (substance), SCTID 226828009. Parent concepts are too general, and sibling types of cheese would be inaccurate. The context ‘listed in history’ does not convert this to a finding or exposure concept; it simply denotes the substance."
416619008,Depression anxiety stress scales anxiety score (observable entity),Review note: DASS anxiety score,"This positions the DASS anxiety score within a review note but refers to the same observable entity without adding severity, timing, or numeric values. The category is Observable entity. The exact mapping is to Depression anxiety stress scales anxiety score (416619008). Although the phrase contains review context, the coded concept remains the anxiety score itself; broader parents or other DASS component scores would be inaccurate because the wording specifies the DASS anxiety score."
217779001,Inhalation and ingestion of food causing obstruction of respiratory tract or suffocation (event),Event: choking on food leading to inability to breathe,"This entry explicitly frames an event where choking on food led to inability to breathe, corresponding to food causing airway obstruction/suffocation. No intent, severity, or outcome beyond suffocation risk is included. It fits SNOMED CT’s Event category. The best match is 217779001, which names food as the cause and obstruction/suffocation of the respiratory tract as the effect. Parent concepts that omit the food agent are less precise, and siblings involving non-food objects would be inappropriate. Child concepts limited to inhalation-only or ingestion-only mechanisms would be narrower than this general event wording."
223535004,Madagascar (geographic location),Madagascar entered on intake form,The phrase states Madagascar is entered on a form as a location value and does not imply further details like residence or travel. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location (Location hierarchy). SCTID 223535004 appropriately codes the specific place. Using a broader parent concept would be too general; selecting a city or neighboring country (child/sibling) would be wrong. The intake form context does not change the concept.
17233007,Salmonella Simi (organism),The organism referenced is Salmonella Simi,"This entry identifies Salmonella Simi as the organism of reference, without asserting detection, infection, or any clinical outcome. The concept is the microorganism itself, classified under the SNOMED CT Organism category. The best match is Salmonella Simi (organism), SCTID 17233007. Using general parent concepts would be nonspecific, and other serovars as siblings do not match. The wording adds no attributes beyond naming the organism, keeping the mapping at the exact organism concept."
277402008,Tinnitus loudness match to frequency of best hearing threshold (procedure),Tinnitus loudness matching conducted at the frequency of maximum hearing sensitivity,"The entry specifies the tinnitus loudness matching done at the frequency of maximum sensitivity, which is the best hearing threshold frequency. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 277402008 precisely corresponds to this procedure. Generic loudness matching or sibling procedures like pitch match or minimum masking would not match the stated frequency criterion. The term 'maximum hearing sensitivity' is a standard clinical synonym for best threshold without adding attributes."
411770005,Ribes sylvestre diagnostic allergen extract (product),Ribes sylvestre diagnostic allergen extract listed,"The wording indicates that the specific product is listed, preserving the exact product identity. SNOMED CT category: Product. “Listed” is contextual and does not alter the product’s classification; the diagnostic allergen extract of Ribes sylvestre remains the focal concept. It is more specific than a generic diagnostic allergen extract and does not introduce attributes that would suggest a child concept, so 411770005 is correct."
1303764007,Phoniatrics (qualifier value),Phoniatry,"This entry uses the synonym “Phoniatry,” which is clinically equivalent to “Phoniatrics” and denotes the same specialty field. The main concept is a specialty designation, with no action or service implied. In SNOMED CT, the category is Qualifier value, and SCTID 1303764007 is the exact match for the specialty. Mapping to a parent like “Medical specialty” would be too generic, and mapping to sibling concepts such as “Voice therapy” or “Speech therapy” would be inappropriate because those are services/procedures rather than the specialty itself. The synonym does not introduce new attributes and thus maintains the same code selection."
389081007,Gray matter structure of central nervous system (body structure),Gray matter within the central nervous system,"This entry describes the anatomical gray matter located in the CNS as a whole, fitting the Body structure category. SCTID 389081007 is the exact match because it specifies gray matter in the central nervous system without limiting to any subregion. A parent concept like 'Structure of CNS' lacks the gray-versus-white distinction, and child concepts such as brain-only gray matter are not indicated. Sibling white matter entities are explicitly excluded by the wording 'gray matter.'"
223793005,Connaught county (geographic location),Connaught County,"The main concept explicitly stated is the geographic place name “Connaught County.” This aligns with the SNOMED CT category Geographic location within the Location hierarchy. The entry is a direct use of the preferred term and unambiguously identifies the county as the intended administrative geographic unit. Using a broader parent such as “Geographic location” or “County (administrative region)” would be too general, and siblings like other named counties or provinces (e.g., Connacht province) would be incorrect because the wording specifies a county, not a province or other region. No additional attributes are introduced, so SCTID 223793005 is the most precise match."
911753481000004108,Histologic type of primary malignant neoplasm of esophagus (observable entity),Primary esophageal malignancy histology type requested,"This request centers on the histology type for a primary esophageal cancer, which corresponds to the observable attribute “histologic type.” The main concept is an Observable entity capturing the classification type for the primary malignant neoplasm of the esophagus. No result, grade, or stage is provided. The wording includes site and primary status, making it more specific than parent observables and distinct from sibling attributes (grade, subtype). Thus, it maps best to SCTID 911753481000004108."
91154008,Free-standing birthing center (environment),Birthing center (independent of hospital),"The parenthetical clarifies that the birthing center is independent of a hospital, which is the defining feature of the free-standing birthing center environment (SNOMED CT 91154008). This rules out hospital-based siblings and generic parent concepts. No added clinical attributes are present; it is strictly an environmental identifier, making 91154008 the most accurate code."
279668007,Structure of upper pole of seminal vesicle (body structure),Upper extremity of seminal vesicle,"The term 'upper extremity' is an anatomical synonym for 'upper pole,' indicating the superior-most part of the seminal vesicle. This aligns precisely with the Body structure concept Structure of upper pole of seminal vesicle (SCTID 279668007). No laterality or additional clinical attributes are introduced, so mapping to a parent (entire seminal vesicle) would be underspecified, and to a child (e.g., left/right upper pole) would be over-specified relative to the entry."
34263000,"Medical balloon, device (physical object)",Equipment list includes a medical balloon device,"This documentation phrase identifies that an equipment list contains a medical balloon device, without describing procedural use or anatomical context. It belongs to the Physical object (Device) category, and SCTID 34263000 is the precise mapping. The entry does not imply catheter-based devices, pumps, or specific therapeutic balloons, so child/sibling concepts are excluded. The general device description is specific enough to avoid mapping to a more generic device category."
31369000,Purine nucleosidase (substance),Purine nucleosidase entry,"Despite the contextual word 'entry,' the main concept is clearly the substance purine nucleosidase, with no added attributes about use or source. This is a Substance concept and aligns exactly with SCTID 31369000. Parent categories like nucleosidase or enzyme are too general, and siblings such as purine nucleoside phosphorylase denote different mechanisms, so the precise substance code is appropriate."
223571003,Asian country (geographic location),National-level geographic location in Asia (Asian country),"The entry explicitly states the granularity (national-level) and the continent (Asia), equating directly to 'Asian country'. Category: Geographic location. It maps to SCTID 223571003 by making the continent and country granularity explicit while avoiding any further attributes. It would be broader if the continent were omitted and narrower if a specific country were named; neither occurs here."
118855008,Procedure on urinary bladder (procedure),Procedure directed at the urinary bladder,"The phrase indicates that the procedure is targeted to the urinary bladder and does not disclose technique (e.g., endoscopic vs open) or clinical intent (e.g., diagnostic vs therapeutic). The main concept is a bladder-directed procedure. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The most precise mapping is 118855008 (Procedure on urinary bladder). More general parents would lose the site specificity, and children specifying biopsy, catheterization, irrigation, resection, or cystoscopy are not supported by the wording."
447355008,Dialysis fluid specimen obtained after continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (specimen),Patient provided CAPD dialysate effluent sample (specimen),"This is a patient-related documentation variant indicating a provided specimen of dialysate effluent from CAPD. The main concept is the dialysis fluid specimen obtained after continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, with no extra attributes beyond the specimen identity. The SNOMED CT category is Specimen. SCTID 447355008 is the precise code because it specifies post-CAPD effluent; a generic dialysis fluid specimen (parent) would lose modality specificity, and APD-related specimens (sibling) would be inaccurate. The wording is synonymous with the concept and maintains code appropriateness."
66922009,Division of goniosynechiae (procedure),Clinic documentation: lysis of goniosynechiae,"This entry shows clinic documentation of the procedure, stated as lysis of goniosynechiae, synonymous with division of angle synechiae. No added attributes (technique, laterality, timing) are included. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure. SCTID 66922009 is the best fit because it codes division of goniosynechiae. Broader parent codes lacking angle specificity and sibling procedures addressing posterior synechiae or other angle interventions do not match the described synechialysis."
373103009,Breast cytologic material obtained by incisional biopsy (specimen),Breast incisional biopsy cytologic material for lab,"This indicates a specimen of breast cytologic material derived from an incisional biopsy and destined for laboratory analysis; the core concept is the specimen, placing it in the Specimen hierarchy. The mention of 'for lab' adds context without changing the specimen type. The combination of location and acquisition method precisely maps to SCTID 373103009, excluding broader parents or siblings with alternative collection techniques."
130189003,Precorrin-4 C11-methyltransferase (substance),Precorrin-4 C11 methyltransferase enzyme,"The entry specifies it is an enzyme, but otherwise exactly names the substance precorrin-4 C11-methyltransferase. This fits the SNOMED CT Substance category, with SCTID 130189003. No findings, procedures, or product qualifiers are introduced. Parent or sibling concepts (e.g., other precorrin methyltransferases) would not match the C11 designation and would be less precise than this exact substance code."
223549008,South Africa (geographic location),Country name recorded: South Africa,"This entry records the country name as 'South Africa.' The exact SNOMED CT concept is South Africa (geographic location), SCTID 223549008, category Location. The field label does not alter the geographic identity. Parent concepts are too generic, and no children (e.g., provinces) are mentioned. The mapping is uniquely to the country-level location."
702882007,Mental health clinic (environment),Mental health clinic,"The entry explicitly names the place type as a mental health clinic, which corresponds exactly to the SNOMED CT concept Mental health clinic (environment), SCTID 702882007. The semantic tag is environment, placing it in the Environment or geographical location category. No qualifiers such as inpatient/outpatient, specialty subsets (e.g., psychiatry-only), or organizational form are added. Using the precise term avoids mapping up to the parent Clinic (environment) and avoids siblings like Psychiatric clinic (environment). Thus, this is the most specific environment match for 702882007."
468876002,Electronic signal integration filter (physical object),Electronic filter for signal integration,"This phrase clearly states an electronic filter whose purpose is signal integration. It maps to the Physical object Electronic signal integration filter (SCTID: 468876002). By specifying integration, it avoids the broader parent of non-specified electronic filters and does not imply alternative sibling functions such as differentiation or band selection. No additional attributes are present, maintaining a precise match."
250771004,Actual blood loss (observable entity),Imaging report: actual blood loss,"Even within an imaging report context, the entry refers to the observable entity of actual blood loss without additional attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Observable entity, and SCTID 250771004 matches the measured blood loss. It is clearly not an estimate nor a clinical finding like hemorrhage, making parent/sibling concepts less suitable."
416548008,Unsuccessful intrauterine contraceptive device insertion (situation),IUD insertion not successful,"This entry succinctly communicates that an IUD insertion was unsuccessful, directly aligning with SCTID 416548008 in the Situation hierarchy. The main concept is the failed outcome of an IUD insertion. No cause, timing, or other attributes are specified. Parent concepts like 'Unsuccessful procedure' are too broad, and 'Insertion of IUCD' without the failure context is less precise. Sibling concepts describing other events (e.g., IUD removal) do not match."
224061003,Kansas (geographic location),Kansas—U.S. state,"This states Kansas and classifies it as a U.S. state, still denoting the same geographic location. The SNOMED CT category is Geographic location. It maps most precisely to Kansas (geographic location) SCTID 224061003, not to a parent (United States) or any child locality. The classification does not introduce additional clinical attributes."
423651002,Structure of subdivision of subdural space of spinal cord (body structure),Component region within spinal subdural space,"The entry identifies a component region, meaning a subdivided part of the subdural space associated with the spinal cord. It belongs to the Body structure hierarchy and maps to SNOMED CT 423651002. Choosing the parent concept would ignore the 'component' notion of being a part. No specific vertebral levels or additional qualifiers are provided to indicate a child concept. Sibling concepts for cranial subdural or other spinal meningeal spaces are not appropriate. 'Component region' is a safe synonym for 'subdivision' of the same anatomical space."
717327006,Angiography device (physical object),Angiograph,"‘Angiograph’ is a conventional name for the angiography device itself, a Physical object/Device. This precisely matches Angiography device (717327006). Using broader terms like radiographic device or imaging system would be too nonspecific, and mapping to children such as digital subtraction angiograph or coronary angiograph would add technique or body‑system focus not present. The synonym is clinically equivalent to ‘angiography device’ and does not change code selection."
699746006,Specimen transport medium (substance),Specimen transport medium present,"The phrase asserts the presence of a specimen transport medium, referencing the substance itself without specifying subtype or use details. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. The best code is 699746006, as it directly corresponds to transport medium intended for specimens. Parent concepts lacking the specimen qualifier are too general, and child concepts specifying particular formulations would add unsupported detail."
392628004,Subfamily Cardiocraniinae (organism),Cardiocraniinae,"The entry names the taxonomic subfamily Cardiocraniinae without additional qualifiers. The main concept is an organism taxon at the subfamily rank. In SNOMED CT, this belongs to the Organism category. SCTID 392628004 precisely represents the subfamily Cardiocraniinae. Using only the Latin taxon avoids ambiguity with parent concepts such as Dipodidae (family) or child concepts like specific genera/species. No sibling subfamily is implied. The single-word taxon is a clinically safe, exact designation and does not introduce any attributes beyond the organism identity."
736235008,Pediatric inpatient care plan (record artifact),Inpatient pediatric care plan,"Reordered wording keeps the same meaning: a care plan for pediatric patients in an inpatient setting. The concept is a documented care plan artifact; SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. This maps most precisely to Pediatric inpatient care plan SCTID 736235008. Parent concepts like general care plan lack both pediatric and inpatient specificity, and siblings like adult inpatient or pediatric outpatient care plans diverge from the stated context. The reordering does not change the semantic content or introduce other attributes."
417249005,Magnetic resonance imaging of thorax normal (finding),Normal MRI of the thorax,"This entry explicitly indicates an MRI of the thorax with a normal outcome. The core elements are MRI modality, thorax as the anatomical region, and normality of findings. It is a Clinical finding, mapping specifically to SNOMED CT 417249005. Broader parent concepts like “MRI of thorax” describe procedures without result, and sibling concepts such as “abnormal thorax MRI” would not fit. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase and does not introduce attributes like contrast, timing, or substructures."
2491002,"Intra-aortic balloon catheter, device (physical object)",IAB catheter,"The abbreviation IAB catheter is a clinically common synonym for intra-aortic balloon catheter, referring only to the catheter device. This is a Physical object (Device) and maps to SNOMED CT 2491002. It does not imply the pump console, therapy, insertion, or status, avoiding siblings such as intra-aortic balloon pump and procedure codes. Parent concepts like balloon catheter are less precise because they omit the intra-aortic specificity. The abbreviation expands to the same device class without changing the code selection."
109241007,Aluminium paste (substance),Aluminium paste,"This uses the UK spelling 'aluminium' but refers to the same substance—aluminum in paste form. The main concept is a substance, with the explicit paste preparation implied. SNOMED CT category: Substance. It aligns exactly with 109241007 Aluminium paste (substance). More general parent concepts like Aluminium (substance) do not capture the paste form, and other children or siblings (e.g., aluminum gel, aluminum powder, aluminum hydroxide) would introduce different physical or chemical characteristics. The synonym is clinically equivalent and does not change code selection."
425071008,Genus Aegotheles (organism),Aegotheles spp. (genus level),"The notation 'spp.' indicates unspecified species within a genus, and the explicit qualifier '(genus level)' clarifies the intended rank. This points to the Organism concept 'Genus Aegotheles' (SCTID 425071008) in SNOMED CT. It avoids selection of any particular species (children) and does not broaden to the family or order, ensuring correct genus-level coding."
1258860000,Overnight daycare (environment),Overnight daycare unit,"The wording describes a unit of a facility functioning as overnight daycare, maintaining the environment concept. The concept is an overnight daycare unit; attribute: overnight. The SNOMED CT category is Environment or geographical location. SCTID 1258860000 is appropriate because the defining feature is daycare during overnight hours. Parent concepts that lack overnight detail are less specific, and siblings such as hospital units or inpatient units would misclassify the environment. 'Unit' is a neutral facility synonym and keeps the same code intent."
467675002,Cardiotocograph (physical object),Cardiotocograph system,"The term ‘system’ refers to the complete device setup for cardiotocography, i.e., the cardiotocograph. SNOMED CT category: Physical object (device). It names the hardware without implying usage, thus SCTID 467675002 is the correct code. Parent or sibling device concepts (e.g., generic monitoring system) are less precise. ‘System’ is a standard synonym for the whole device assembly and does not change the intended concept."
41447009,Incision of skin (procedure),Skin incision executed,"“Executed” is a documentation verb indicating the procedure was done; the core concept remains an incision of the skin. This belongs to the Procedure category and maps directly to SNOMED CT 41447009. No attributes such as location details, drainage, excision, or deeper tissue involvement are included, so parent or child concepts are less appropriate."
117887008,Measurement of Avian paramyxovirus 3 antibody (procedure),Avian paramyxovirus type 3 antibody measurement,"This phrase describes a measurement procedure for antibodies to Avian paramyxovirus type 3. The main concept is antibody measurement specific to the avian paramyxovirus type 3 target, and no other attributes (such as method, titer, immunoglobulin class, result, or timing) are present. The SNOMED CT category is Procedure, and the exact concept 117887008 matches this wording. A parent concept like measurement of avian paramyxovirus antibody would lack the type-3 specificity, and siblings covering type 1 or type 2, or methods like ELISA, or Ig subclass-specific measurements would diverge. “Type 3” is a clinically equivalent way of stating APMV-3 and does not change code selection."
1687002,Actinomyces howellii (organism),Actinomyces howellii,"The entry names the specific organism Actinomyces howellii without any added clinical attributes. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The most precise match is Actinomyces howellii (organism), SCTID 1687002, because the text refers solely to the taxonomic entity. Broader parents like Actinomyces species or the Actinomyces genus are less specific, and sibling species (e.g., A. israelii) would be incorrect. No wording implies a finding of detection or infection, so concepts like ‘presence of Actinomyces’ are not appropriate."
25893001,Synodus synodus (organism),Synodus synodus organism entry,"This entry records the organism as Synodus synodus, which is a species-level taxon and corresponds directly to SNOMED CT concept 25893001 under Organism. The context 'organism entry' does not introduce clinical attributes; it merely documents the taxon. Parent classes like Fish or Synodus (genus) lack specificity, and any sibling species would not match the explicit name. Therefore, Synodus synodus (organism) is the appropriate code."
446273004,Red food coloring (substance),Red color additive (food),"The wording indicates a color additive for food in the red color, which is semantically equivalent to red food coloring, a Substance. It does not introduce allergy, exposure, or any other finding. The color specification narrows it beyond the parent Food coloring (substance). Without naming a particular dye, child concepts are overly specific. Sibling concepts represent different colors. Map to 446273004 Red food coloring (substance)."
421084007,Lake (environment),Place: lake (environment),"This entry identifies the place as a lake and clarifies environmental context, without adding details such as shore proximity, water composition, or timing. It maps most precisely to Lake (environment) (SCTID 421084007) under Environment or geographical location. Broader parents (e.g., Water environment) are less specific, and sibling concepts (River, Pond, Lakeshore) are not suggested. 'Place' is a neutral descriptor equivalent to environment for coding purposes."
269794007,Foreign body accident - eye (event),Discharge summary: eye foreign body accident,"In a discharge context, this records that the relevant event was an eye foreign body accident, corresponding to Foreign body accident - eye (event) [269794007]. Category: Event. The discharge header is contextual only; the concept remains the accident event. No attributes such as laterality, timing, severity, or presence of retained foreign body are introduced, preventing misclassification to injury or finding concepts. This is the most precise match for the described event."
736054002,Pressure injury care plan (record artifact),Pressure injury care plan on file,"“On file” communicates the presence of a care plan artifact within the patient’s records, explicitly for pressure injury. Category: Record artifact. The wording points to the same concept as a documented plan-of-care, making 736054002 the most accurate code. This entry is more specific than the generic Care plan parent and does not imply a pressure ulcer-only plan or a wound care plan sibling. No extra attributes like timing, stage, or severity are included."
55636006,Octyl cresol (substance),Diagnostic report reference: octyl cresol,"The entry references octyl cresol within a diagnostic report context, but does not introduce attributes like concentration, presence/absence, or isomer. It is a Substance and maps to Octyl cresol (substance) SCTID 55636006. Parent concepts are too broad, and no child concept detail (e.g., positional isomer) is present. The context is administrative and does not change the substance concept selection."
70630002,Schizoid character (finding),Schizoid character described by therapist,"This is a therapist’s description of schizoid character, which is an observed Clinical finding. It matches Schizoid character (finding) SCTID 70630002. The wording does not diagnose a personality disorder nor add attributes like severity or temporality, so disorder-level concepts are less appropriate."
1365804008,Photographic intraoral direct image of frontal view with teeth apart (record artifact),"Intraoral direct image, frontal view, teeth apart","This is a record artifact specifying a photographic intraoral direct image in a frontal view with teeth apart, precisely aligning with SCTID 1365804008. The SNOMED CT category is Record artifact. The explicit combination of intraoral, direct, frontal, and teeth apart excludes broader parents and other siblings such as occlusal-tooth position or different views/locations. The use of 'image' versus 'photograph' remains clinically equivalent in this artifact context."
82005004,Cebidichthys violaceus (organism),Cebidichthys violaceus,"The entry names the species Cebidichthys violaceus directly, which is a taxonomic organism concept. SNOMED CT category: Organism. This is the most precise match to SCTID 82005004 because it specifies the exact species. Broader parents such as Fish (organism), Stichaeidae (organism), or Cebidichthys (genus) are less specific, and any sibling or child concepts would denote different taxa. No additional attributes (e.g., exposure, injury, age, sex) are introduced."
409507000,Exposure to biological agent via mucous membrane (event),Reported mucous membrane exposure to biological agent,"This indicates a reported exposure event to a biological agent with the route being mucous membrane. It is an Event. 'Reported' is a documentation context that does not alter the clinical concept. With the route explicitly stated, SCTID 409507000 is the precise match. Broader exposure events or other-route siblings would be less accurate for this statement."
107135003,Order Piciformes (organism),Order Piciformes,"The entry explicitly names the taxonomic order Piciformes, which is an organism category at the order rank. The SNOMED CT concept 'Order Piciformes (organism)' [SCTID: 107135003] is the most precise match because it represents this exact taxonomic order. This does not introduce any additional attributes such as cause, severity, timing, or laterality. Parent concepts like 'Aves (class)' would be too broad, and child or sibling concepts such as specific families (e.g., Picidae, Ramphastidae) would be too narrow. The wording aligns exactly with the organism category 'Order'."
91076002,Actinobacillus salpingitis (organism),Speciation label: Actinobacillus salpingitis,"While presented in a laboratory speciation context, the entry itself is solely the organism name Actinobacillus salpingitis. The main concept is the bacterial species identity. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The best match is Actinobacillus salpingitis (organism), SCTID 91076002. Detection or positivity is not claimed; thus, a finding of detection is not more accurate. Parent or sibling taxa would either generalize or misidentify the species."
4251000179103,Magnetic resonance imaging report (record artifact),MRI report,"This entry uses the common abbreviation MRI while clearly referring to the report document associated with that imaging modality. The concept type is a Record artifact, and SCTID 4251000179103 matches best because it specifies a radiology report for MRI rather than an imaging procedure, image set, or result. A parent like Radiology report would be too generic, and siblings such as CT report or Ultrasound report would be incorrect. The abbreviation MRI is a clinically standard synonym for magnetic resonance imaging, and adding “report” narrows it to the document artifact without introducing additional attributes (e.g., body site, contrast, timing, or results)."
223360003,Bermuda (geographic location),Bermuda archipelago,"The term ‘Bermuda archipelago’ denotes the same geographic location, using a topographic synonym that does not change the underlying concept. The main concept is the geographic entity ‘Bermuda.’ Category: Qualifier value. This is the most precise match to Bermuda (geographic location), SCTID 223360003; it does not imply a broader region nor a sub-location. Child concepts like specific islands or cities are not indicated. The synonym is clinically equivalent and preserves code selection."
736385001,Major plastic surgery inpatient care plan (record artifact),Admission care plan (major plastic surgery),"The entry frames the care plan in the context of a hospital admission, which is synonymous with inpatient, and targets major plastic surgery. It represents a documented plan artifact and not a procedure. SNOMED CT category: Record artifact. SCTID 736385001 precisely matches an inpatient care plan for major plastic surgery; using a parent concept like admission care plan alone or plastic surgery admission care plan without 'major' would be too broad. Sibling options (e.g., minor plastic surgery admission plans) are excluded by the 'major' qualifier."
59711000119107,History of pseudoaneurysm (situation),Previously had a pseudoaneurysm.,"The phrase clearly states the patient had a pseudoaneurysm in the past, establishing a historical situation. In SNOMED CT, this is captured under Situation with explicit context as “History of pseudoaneurysm (situation)” SCTID 59711000119107. The disorder concept would imply current disease and is therefore inappropriate. Parent concepts are overly broad, and child/sibling concepts that add anatomical location or cause are not supported by the text. This paraphrase is clinically equivalent and does not introduce new attributes."
785327002,Product containing xenon radioisotope (product),Pharmacy stock: xenon radioisotope radiopharmaceutical,"This context indicates a stocked product that is a radiopharmaceutical containing a xenon radioisotope, without extra attributes like isotope number, dose, or route. It belongs to the Product hierarchy and matches SCTID 785327002. More general parents (e.g., “radiopharmaceutical stock”) would omit xenon, while children identifying specific xenon isotopes or clinical drug forms would be too detailed. Siblings representing other radioisotopes or non-radioactive xenon do not align with the “radioisotope” specification. The synonym “radiopharmaceutical” signals a product-level concept and does not change the code selection."
224699009,Study (environment),"Study, room","This entry clarifies that 'study' is being used as a room designation, indicating a physical environment. Main concept: study room environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment (environment). The exact match is 224699009 Study (environment). Using broader parents would reduce specificity, and siblings (e.g., office, den, library) are not indicated. It does not convey any clinical events or attributes beyond the environment."
250877009,Mandatory breath rate (observable entity),Follow-up: mandatory respiratory rate,"This follow-up note uses a clinically equivalent synonym to indicate the same observable: the rate of mandatory breaths. No numeric values or extra qualifiers are added. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. It maps to 250877009 Mandatory breath rate. Parent/sibling observables (generic RR, spontaneous or total RR, minute ventilation) are less appropriate because 'mandatory' restricts the concept to machine-delivered breaths."
309018005,Referred to service (finding),Radiology report note: patient referred to service,"Within an imaging report, this note documents that the patient has been referred to a service, without naming the service or adding reasons, thus expressing the referral status as a finding. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding, and Referred to service (finding) [309018005] is the most precise code. Procedure concepts would represent the act; child concepts specifying a destination service or sibling statuses (requested, accepted) would introduce details not present. The reporting context keeps the meaning equivalent."
118339006,Continuous wave laser beam (physical force),Described as a continuous-wave laser beam,"The entry explicitly characterizes the beam as continuous-wave laser emission, emphasizing the physical force. The SNOMED CT category is Physical force. SCTID 118339006 is the exact match, as CW modality is specified. Parent laser beam concepts lack mode detail, and pulsed-beam siblings would be incorrect. The wording adds no procedural or clinical attributes."
289026001,Does finger feed (finding),Does finger feed,"The entry states directly that the patient does finger feed, expressing the feeding method without adding timing, cause, or other qualifiers. The main medical concept is the practice of finger feeding. This is a Clinical finding in SNOMED CT and maps precisely to SCTID 289026001 (Does finger feed). Broader parent concepts like generic feeding method findings would be less specific, and sibling methods (e.g., bottle, breast, cup) are not indicated. The phrasing is a direct match to the preferred term and does not introduce any attributes beyond the method used."
1365792007,Photographic extraoral image of face indicating nerve weakness (record artifact),Chart artifact: extraoral facial photograph indicating nerve weakness (record artifact),"This entry notes a chart artifact consisting of an extraoral facial photograph indicating nerve weakness, reinforcing its status as a documentation element. The category in SNOMED CT is Record artifact. Choosing a parent like general record artifact would be less specific; siblings such as intraoral photographs or findings of nerve weakness would be incorrect. The wording „chart artifact“ is an acceptable synonym for record artifact in context and does not alter the clinical attributes."
309946005,Special care baby unit (environment),Special care baby unit,"The entry names the specific healthcare environment: a special care baby unit dedicated to neonatal special care. The main concept is the environment of care. SNOMED CT category: Environment. This maps precisely to SCTID 309946005 because it exactly labels the specialized neonatal care ward without adding intensity (ICU) or other attributes. Using the parent like a generic hospital ward or a sibling such as a neonatal intensive care unit would be less specific or incorrect. No extra attributes (severity, timing, cause) are introduced."
50241000087101,Presence of food residue in lumen of large intestine (finding),Food particles seen in large bowel lumen.,"The entry conveys that food particles (synonymous with food residue) are seen inside the lumen of the large bowel. The SNOMED CT category is Clinical finding. There is no added attribute beyond presence and site, and ‘large bowel’ is equivalent to large intestine. It does not imply colon-only or rectum-only involvement, so the exact concept SCTID 50241000087101 is the correct and most precise mapping."
297788004,Chinantec language (qualifier value),Communication language: Chinantec,"The entry identifies Chinantec as the selected language for communication, pointing to the language value. It avoids introducing modifiers such as dialect, region, or proficiency. Category: Qualifier value. The correct code is Chinantec language (297788004). A parent Language concept would be nonspecific, and siblings represent other languages."
1083101000112107,Francisella noatunensis (organism),F. noatunensis,"This entry uses the standard binomial abbreviation for the species, with 'F.' denoting the genus Francisella and 'noatunensis' the species epithet, without adding any clinical qualifiers. The SNOMED CT category is Organism. The best match is Francisella noatunensis (SCTID: 1083101000112107), as the abbreviation is a clinically equivalent synonym of the full scientific name and does not imply presence, disease, or subspecies. Parent genus-only concepts and sibling species would be less specific or incorrect, and infection-related disorder codes would introduce attributes not stated."
1381609000,Acetyl norfentanyl (substance),Provider note—discussed acetyl norfentanyl,"This documentation indicates discussion of the named chemical, not its administration, detection, or measurement. The relevant SNOMED CT category is Substance, and the precise concept is Acetyl norfentanyl (substance) SCTID 1381609000. Parent or sibling substances like norfentanyl or acetylfentanyl would be incorrect since the note names acetyl norfentanyl specifically, and finding or observable concepts would add attributes (presence/level) not present in the wording."
1258889003,Forensic medicine center (environment),Forensic medicine facility,"This entry uses “facility” while retaining the defining context “forensic medicine,” which still denotes the same specialized center environment. SNOMED CT category: Environment or geographical location. It introduces no additional attributes; it is a location descriptor. A broader parent like healthcare facility would be nonspecific, and siblings such as forensic laboratory or medical examiner’s office differ in facility subtype. SCTID 1258889003 remains the correct, most specific code."
427117001,Substance with hydrolase inhibitor mechanism of action (substance),Substance labeled with hydrolase inhibitor mechanism,"This entry indicates a substance labeled by its mechanism as a hydrolase inhibitor, which maps to 'Substance with hydrolase inhibitor mechanism of action' (SCTID 427117001). Category is Substance. It specifies hydrolase inhibition without adding subtype specificity or therapeutic administration details, making parent or child concepts less appropriate. The wording is a clinically equivalent paraphrase of the preferred term."
721965002,Laboratory order (record artifact),Laboratory order created,"The phrase reflects the creation of the record artifact that is a laboratory order. The correct SNOMED CT concept is Laboratory order (SCTID 721965002), falling under Record artifact. It avoids naming specific tests or introducing attributes like priority or timing beyond mere existence, so children are not indicated. Parents are too broad, and sibling orders in other domains do not match the laboratory scope."
706473009,Simulator (physical object),Simulator (physical object),"This entry restates the preferred term with its category, making explicit that it is a tangible physical object. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object. The exact code is 706473009 Simulator (physical object), matching the provided concept verbatim. Parent or child selections would be inappropriate: the parent loses the simulator property, and children add unspecified type details. No additional attributes are present beyond the category itself."
223358000,Aruba (geographic location),Place: Aruba,"The entry conveys that the place in question is Aruba, with no further qualifiers. The concept is a Location within SNOMED CT. It maps directly to Aruba (geographic location), SCTID 223358000. No parent-level region or sibling territory is indicated, and no child locality is specified. ‘Place’ is a generic synonym for a location and does not change the intended code."
411917009,Ligustrum vulgare specific diagnostic allergen extract (product),Diagnostic allergen extract of Ligustrum vulgare,"The entry clearly represents a product: a diagnostic allergen extract sourced from Ligustrum vulgare. No concentration, administration method, or test outcome is implied. As a Product, the most precise SNOMED CT match is 411917009. Parent concepts like general diagnostic allergen extracts are less specific, while sibling concepts such as therapeutic preparations or extracts of other species are not indicated by the text. The phrasing is a direct paraphrase of the preferred term and does not alter meaning."
880119001,Measured quantity of intake of leucine in 24 hours (observable entity),Measured 24-hour leucine ingestion amount,"This entry states a measured amount of leucine ingestion over 24 hours, with attributes: leucine (substance), ingestion/intake, measurement, and timeframe. SNOMED CT category: Observable entity. It directly corresponds to the concept for measured quantity of intake of leucine in 24 hours. Parents that generalize to amino acids or other nutrients are insufficiently specific, and siblings such as non-intake leucine observables are mismatched. “Ingestion” is a clinically equivalent term to intake in nutrition and does not change the code selection."
27656005,Gitalin (substance),Reference substance: gitalin,"A 'reference substance' label indicates gitalin is the named substance, not a product or test result, fitting the SNOMED CT Substance concept 'Gitalin (substance)' SCTID 27656005. Parent classes like 'Cardiac glycoside' are too general, and siblings are distinct molecules. The contextual term 'reference substance' does not add attributes such as dosage, route, or timing and is therefore clinically equivalent for coding the substance."
773604007,Segesterone acetate (substance),Segesterone acetate named on lab requisition,"This entry indicates the substance Segesterone acetate is named in a laboratory requisition context, but it does not specify levels, methods, or results. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. Therefore, Segesterone acetate (substance), SCTID 773604007, best fits. Parent classes are less specific, and analysis or observation concepts are not implicated because the entry is simply naming the analyte/substance."
768633007,Product containing lipoprotein (product),Lipoprotein product,"The phrase identifies a product characterized by containing lipoprotein; it does not specify subtype, dose, route, or brand. The SNOMED CT category is Product. Although more concise, 'lipoprotein product' is a clinically safe synonym that conveys a product whose defining ingredient is lipoprotein. A parent like nonspecific product containing substance is too general, and children or siblings focused on specific lipoprotein types or apolipoproteins would be inappropriate. Therefore, Product containing lipoprotein (768633007) is the correct code."
706101002,Bed mattress support platform (physical object),Supply listing: bed mattress support platform,The entry lists the object for supply purposes while naming only the mattress support platform for a bed. No extra attributes such as material or adjustability are included. SNOMED CT category: Physical object. Code 706101002 is exact. Using Bed frame or Box spring would denote different items; Bed is too generic.
239582009,Amputation of finger through carpometacarpal joint (procedure),Procedure: finger amputation via carpometacarpal joint disarticulation,"This operative phrasing identifies a finger amputation accomplished by disarticulation at the carpometacarpal joint. SNOMED CT category: Procedure. The precise code is 239582009, reflecting finger amputation through the CMC joint. Parent concepts do not indicate the joint level, and alternatives like “ray amputation” are inappropriate because metacarpal resection is not described. The wording uses “via disarticulation” as a clinically equivalent synonym for amputation through the joint."
768615001,Product containing propylamine (product),Radiology intake notes: propylamine-containing medication,"The phrase documents, in a radiology intake context, a medication that contains propylamine, matching a product containing propylamine. The SNOMED CT category is Product. SCTID 768615001 is appropriate because it specifies the ingredient without adding dose, route, or salt details. Parent concepts like general medication are too broad, while children involving specific formulations or exclusive propylamine are too narrow for the wording. The intake context is metadata and does not affect the product code selection."
419390002,Medical stepdown unit (environment),Patient is in the medical stepdown unit,"A patient-location statement that purely indicates the environment: the medical stepdown unit. This is an Environment concept and best matches Medical stepdown unit (environment) [419390002]. The sentence adds no extra attributes such as specialty beyond medical, procedures, or timing that would shift coding. It excludes the parent generic stepdown unit and sibling environments like surgical stepdown, ICU, or general wards."
242311005,Accidental ingestion of blackthorn berries (event),Poison control log: accidental ingestion of blackthorn berries,"The context label 'Poison control log' does not change the clinical event: accidental ingestion of blackthorn berries. The core concept is an Event, mapping to SCTID 242311005. No symptoms or toxicity are asserted, so poisoning concepts are not appropriate. Parent concepts that generalize the item or omit the accidental qualifier would be less precise. The entry remains specific to accidental ingestion of blackthorn berries."
1380393007,Tissue smear specimen (specimen),Smear prepared from tissue (specimen),"The entry describes a specimen as a smear prepared from tissue. In SNOMED CT, this is a Specimen concept, specifically 'Tissue smear specimen' (1380393007). The paraphrase is clinically equivalent, indicating both material and preparation without adding attributes. Parent concepts lack specificity, and the wording does not imply site-specific or specialized smear variants that would be child or sibling concepts."
398230002,Aspiration of middle ear (procedure),"Ear, middle — aspiration performed","This entry conveys that an aspiration procedure was performed on the middle ear, with no additional qualifiers. It is a Procedure and aligns with Aspiration of middle ear (procedure) [398230002]. Parent categories such as procedure on ear are overly broad, and sibling procedures involving incision (myringotomy) or different sites (external ear canal) are not appropriate. The wording is a clear paraphrase and does not introduce new attributes, so the exact code applies."
710593002,Immunoglobulin M antibody to Bartonella quintana (substance),Target antibody: Bartonella quintana IgM,"The entry names the target antibody as the IgM antibody to Bartonella quintana, referring to the substance. It belongs in the Substance category. SCTID 710593002 is correct. Concepts like 'Bartonella antibody (unspecified isotype)' or 'IgG to B. quintana' would be less precise or incorrect. The phrasing is a synonym that retains the same intrinsic attributes."
770369005,Product containing RNA polymerase inhibitor (product),Medication product containing RNA polymerase inhibitor,"This clearly states a medication product with an RNA polymerase inhibitor active class, corresponding to 'Product containing RNA polymerase inhibitor (product)' SCTID 770369005. Main concept: medication/medicinal product; attribute: pharmacologic class only. Category: Product (Pharmaceutical/biologic product). 'Medication product' maintains product-level semantics without adding administration details, indication, or strength. Parent groupers are less specific, and naming a particular inhibitor would shift to a child concept, which is not present here."
247331000,Ear sensations (observable entity),Otic sensations,"‘Otic’ is a medical synonym for ‘ear,’ so this entry conveys the same generic observable attribute of sensations pertaining to the ear. It most appropriately maps to Ear sensations (observable entity) [247331000] under the Observable entity hierarchy. It does not introduce specific symptom types (pain, ringing, fullness), thus avoiding sibling or child findings, and it is more precise than a broader parent like general bodily sensations."
444661007,High risk pregnancy due to history of preterm labor (finding),High-risk antenatal status attributable to history of preterm labor,"This indicates an antenatal high-risk status with an explicit attribution to a history of preterm labor, fitting the Clinical finding category. It corresponds to High risk pregnancy due to history of preterm labor (444661007). 'Antenatal status' is an acceptable paraphrase for pregnancy status. A parent concept would be too broad, and a sibling like high-risk due to other causes would not match. No extraneous attributes are present."
289941004,Plant extract (substance),Extract from plant source (substance),"This entry qualifies the extract's origin as plant and explicitly frames it as a substance, avoiding product or preparation contexts. The SNOMED CT category is Substance. It fits Plant extract (substance) [289941004] exactly. Using a broader Extract (substance) would omit the specified source, while a child concept would require naming a particular plant, which the entry does not do."
275905002,History of myocardial problem (situation),PMH: heart muscle problem in the past,"This statement places a heart muscle (myocardial) problem in the past medical history (PMH), with no additional attributes such as cause or severity. The SNOMED CT category is Situation due to the explicit historical context. SCTID 275905002 is the correct match because it describes a prior myocardial problem without specifying diagnosis. Parents like “History of cardiac problem” are overly broad, and children like MI or cardiomyopathy histories would be too specific. “Heart muscle problem” is a clinically equivalent synonym of “myocardial problem,” and “in the past” simply restates the inherent history qualifier."
413123006,Blood pressure procedure declined (situation),Patient opted not to have blood pressure measured,"This phrasing indicates the patient chose to decline the blood pressure measurement, a Situation with explicit context. Blood pressure procedure declined (413123006) is the best fit, identifying both the specific procedure and the decline. Broader parents like Procedure declined lack the blood pressure specificity, while siblings such as Blood pressure not obtained do not indicate refusal. The wording “opted not to” is a synonymous expression of decline without additional attributes."
701281008,"Stationary general-purpose fluoroscopic x-ray system, analog (physical object)",Installed analog general-purpose fluoroscopic x-ray machine (stationary),"The entry calls out an installed (stationary) analog fluoroscopic x-ray machine for general-purpose use, which is a device. The SNOMED CT category is Physical object (device). SCTID 701281008 fits these attributes exactly. Choosing a parent without mobility/technology specification or a sibling (e.g., mobile analog machine or stationary digital machine) would misrepresent the described device."
1202028007,Swallowable cell collection sponge in capsule (physical object),Swallowable cell-collecting sponge capsule,"The phrase compresses the preferred term but maintains the core: swallowable capsule containing a sponge for cell collection. Category: Physical object. SCTID 1202028007 is the precise match; broader capsule device or sponge concepts lack the combined features, and sibling devices such as capsule cameras or non-capsule collectors are incorrect. “Cell-collecting” is equivalent to “cell collection,” without adding any additional attributes."
32646006,Electric field (physical force),Electric field indicated,"The wording indicates an electric field without introducing extra attributes such as strength or clinical exposure. SNOMED CT category: Physical force; best match is Electric field (physical force) [32646006]. It is not an event or injury, and it is distinct from sibling phenomena like Electric current or Magnetic field. The term ‘indicated’ is a contextual descriptor and does not change the code selection."
242618005,Bite of primate (event),Narrative summary: patient bitten by a primate,"The narrative phrasing conveys only that a primate bite occurred, with no mention of species, site, severity, or timing. The SNOMED CT category is Event. SCTID 242618005 is the best fit, as it specifically codes a primate bite event. Parent concepts like animal bite are not specific enough, and child concepts naming particular primates would add information not present. The wording is a synonymous expression that maintains the same coding intent."
